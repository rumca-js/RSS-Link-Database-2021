emergency\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59631570\n\nNo one should be in any doubt, there is a tidal wave of Omicron coming\n\nIt is now clear that two doses of vaccine are simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need. \n\nBut the good news is that our scientists are confident that with a third dose, a booster dose, we can all bring our level of protection back up\n\nAt this point our scientists cannot say that Omicron is less severe\n\na wave of Omicron through a population that was not boosted would risk a level of hospitalisation that could overwhelm our NHS and lead sadly to very many deaths\n\nAged 18 and over, in England, third jabs from this week\nThree months since second dose\n\nA third booster dose prevents around 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms

a secondary case, adjusted odds ratio 2.09\n\nHousehold secondary attack\n\nOmicron, 21.6%\n\nDelta, 10.7% \n\nThree to eight-fold increased risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant. \n\nA 20 to 40-fold reduction in neutralising activity by Pfizer 2-dose vaccinee sera for Omicron\n\nAt least 10 fold loss of activity when compared to Delta\n\nGreater reduction in activity was seen for AZ 2- dose sera\n\nAn mRNA booster dose resulted in an increase in neutralising activity irrespective of primary vaccination type\n\nData are urgently required on the durability of neutralising activity \n\nA moderate to high vaccine effectiveness of 70 to 75% is seen in the early period after a booster dose. \n\nWith previous variants, vaccine effectiveness against severe disease, has been higher than effectiveness against mild disease\n \nLateral flow, similar sensitivity to detect Omicron compared to Delta\n\nModelling the potential consequences of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant in

low immune escape and booster jabs are highly effective\n\n20.9 million infections\n\n175,000 hospital admissions\n\n24,700 deaths\n\nMost pessimistic scenario, 1 December and 30 April in England\n\n34.2 million infections\n\n492,000 hospital admissions\n\n74,900 deaths\n\nConclusions and discussion \nWithout the implementation of further control measures,\nhospital admissions resulting from the Omicron wave of transmission,\ncould exceed the peak levels recorded in England during the previous winter wave in 2020-2021\nIn populations with high levels of immunity such as England and South Africa\nOmicron variant has the potential to cause significant disruption\nIn populations with low levels of immunity such Africa\nOmicron may or may not out compete delta\n\nLink to
