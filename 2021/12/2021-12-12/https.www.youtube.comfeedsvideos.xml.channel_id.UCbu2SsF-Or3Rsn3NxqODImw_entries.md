The Halo Universe: A rich, intricate tapestry chronicling humanities’ perseverance in the face of near extinction against universe-destroying technology and exploding Lovecraftian spore monsters.  And Halo Infinite promises to be the culmination of the Halo Universe finally exploring every aspect of Halo lore. So to prepare you for the deepest of dives into history of Halo, video producer Jessie Earl explains every single piece of Halo tie-in media... and may get lost herself.

From Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo 3 to Halo: First Strike to Halo The Graphic Novel to the story of 343 Guilty Spark, not a stone will be left unturned in the entire Halo universe… though perhaps a few stones might be turned inside Jessie Earl’s head. 

And don’t worry, there’s not that much Halo media. 6 main games...  2 spinoff shooters... 2 RTS games... 2 twin-stick shooters… a VR game… a few films… some short films... 20+ novels...several graphic novels too… numerous comics… an audio drama…. A board game… Ok, look, it’s not complicate
