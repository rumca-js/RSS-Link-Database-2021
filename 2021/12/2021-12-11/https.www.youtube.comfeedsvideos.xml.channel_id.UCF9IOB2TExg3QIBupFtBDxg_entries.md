Omicron emergency

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59631570

No one should be in any doubt, there is a tidal wave of Omicron coming

It is now clear that two doses of vaccine are simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need. 

But the good news is that our scientists are confident that with a third dose, a booster dose, we can all bring our level of protection back up

At this point our scientists cannot say that Omicron is less severe

a wave of Omicron through a population that was not boosted would risk a level of hospitalisation that could overwhelm our NHS and lead sadly to very many deaths

Aged 18 and over, in England, third jabs from this week
Three months since second dose

A third booster dose prevents around 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms from Omicron

Omicron cases have now been found in hospital

Warned of the danger of tens of thousands of hospitalisations,

even if omicron were to prove half as severe as delta

SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England 

Technical briefing 31 

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040076/Technical_Briefing_31.pdf

Data cut off, 6 December

260 confirmed cases of Omicron VOC-21NOV-01 (B.1.1.529), 

Identified through sequencing or genotyping in England. 

Additional possible cases identified through S gene target failure

Higher risk of transmission from secondary attack rates

Risk of household transmission from an Omicron index case compared to a Delta index case 3.2 

Risk of a close contact becoming a secondary case, adjusted odds ratio 2.09

Household secondary attack

Omicron, 21.6%

Delta, 10.7% 

Three to eight-fold increased risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant. 

A 20 to 40-fold reduction in neutralising activity by Pfizer 2-dose vaccinee sera for Omicron

At least 10 fold loss of activity when compared to Delta

Greater reduction in activity was seen for AZ 2- dose sera

An mRNA booster dose resulted in an increase in neutralising activity irrespective of primary vaccination type

Data are urgently required on the durability of neutralising activity 

A moderate to high vaccine effectiveness of 70 to 75% is seen in the early period after a booster dose. 

With previous variants, vaccine effectiveness against severe disease, has been higher than effectiveness against mild disease

Growth rate of the Omicron variant

Level of immune escape

Intrinsic transmissibility

Immune escape of Omicron

5.1-fold to 12.8-fold reduction in neutralisation relative to Delta

Intrinsic transmissibility

Omicron variant is growing in England at an exponential growth rate of r = 0.29 per day

This corresponds to a 2.4-day doubling time

Reproduction number Rt = 4.0

Generation interval of 5.5 days

Surge in SARS-CoV-2 transmission beginning in late December 2021

Infections exceeding peak levels recorded during the January 2021 wave in England

The most optimistic scenario, 1 December to 30 April in England

Omicron has low immune escape and booster jabs are highly effective

20.9 million infections

175,000 hospital admissions

24,700 deaths

Most pessimistic scenario, 1 December and 30 April in England

34.2 million infections

492,000 hospital admissions

74,900 deaths

Conclusions and discussion 
Without the implementation of further control measures,
hospital admissions resulting from the Omicron wave of transmission,
could exceed the peak levels recorded in England during the previous winter wave in 2020-2021
In populations with high levels of immunity such as England and South Africa
Omicron variant has the potential to cause significant disruption
In populations with low levels of immunity such Africa
Omicron may or may not out compete delta

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases

The percentage of positive tests nationally:

24.9% (16.4%) higher than last week

Gauteng, 35%

Limpopo, 32.7%

Mpumalanga, 26.9%

North West, 26.0%

Free State, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, 10% to 15%

Eastern Cape and Northern Cape, less than 10%

Dr Richard Friedland, chief executive officer Netcare

Omicron variant data, Covid-19 symptoms now are far milder than the first three waves

Having personally seen many of our patients across our Gauteng hospitals,

 their symptoms are far milder than anything we experienced during the first three waves

Approximately 90% of Covid-19 patients currently in our hospitals require no form of oxygen therapy,

and are considered incidental cases. 

If this trend continues, it would appear that, with a few exceptions of those requiring tertiary care,

the fourth wave can be adequately treated at a primary care level

In the first three waves

Netcare, across 49 acute-care hospitals

Treated 126,000 Covid-19 patients, 

of whom,

44% required admission

26% required DC or ICU

Significantly, all Covid-19 patients admitted were sick and required some form of oxygen therapy. 

The high admission rate, as well as the high percentage of patients requiring ICU or high care is indicative of the severity of cases during the first three waves

Now

337 Covid-19 positive patients admitted

(72% of these patients are in the Gauteng area and 18% in KwaZulu-Natal)

Of these 337,

Approximately 10% are on some form of oxygenation

versus 100% in the first three waves

Eight of 337 (2%) are being ventilated of these, 

two are primary trauma cases

During the first three waves

When the overall community positivity rate breached 26% across South Africa

First wave admissions
2,000

Second wave admissions
2,500

Third wave admissions
3,000

Fourth (omicron) wave admissions
337

Of the patients admitted to Netcare hospitals and facilities since 15 November

75% not vaccinated

Seven deaths in Netcare facilities due to Covid-19 complications

Age distribution of patients

Covid-19 patients admitted since 15 November are on average younger than those seen during the first three waves,

71% being 50 years

Average age of 38.5 years

Patients presentations

Mild to moderate flu-like symptoms

Blocked or runny nose

Headache

Scratchy or sore throat

It is our considered view at this early stage that, 
should this trend continue, 

Covid-19 may be effectively managed at a primary care level, 

with the exception of certain cases requiring admission to tertiary facilities

Dr Fareed Abdullah, Office of Aids and TB Research, SA Medical Research Council

80% of admissions below the age of 50 years,

throughout the Gauteng province in the last two weeks

The best indicator of disease severity is measured by the in-hospital death rate.

There were 10 deaths in the in the past two weeks (cohort of 166)

making up 6.6% of the 166 admissions

(23% for all previous waves)

Four deaths, aged 26-36

Five deaths, aged over 60

There were no Covid-19-related deaths among 34 admissions in the paediatric Covid wards over the last two weeks

Omicron variant could act as a natural vaccine

Professor Eleanor Riley, immunology and infectious diseases, University of Edinburgh

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/covid-news-booster-cases-vaccine-passport-coronavirus-omicron2/

Omicron variant could act as a natural vaccine in the unvaccinated

Britons are very likely to contract the variant in the next couple of weeks

Everybody’s very likely to experience it in the next few weeks. 

If it is milder, and we know infection induces an immune response, 

it is possible that this could act as a natural vaccine, 
getting to those people who have so far been unwilling to be vaccinated

But I think we have to exercise a huge degree of caution with that, 

because there’s a huge ‘if’ about this ‘is it milder?’ 

And I think it’s very dangerous to compare data from South Africa to the UK. 

In the South African population there’s been so many waves of infection they’ve gone through, 

lots of immunity and a much younger population

Advised people to act on the basis that anybody they come into contact with could have coronavirus

Dr Michael Cohen discusses the importance of Vitamin D and zinc for the optimisation of the immune system. Vitamin K2 is also used to distribute calcium to the correct tissues. Thankyou Dr Cohen for this excellent explanation of preventing and minimising infection by enabling the amazing natural immune response.
