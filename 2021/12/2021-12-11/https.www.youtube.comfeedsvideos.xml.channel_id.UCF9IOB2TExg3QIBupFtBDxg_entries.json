emergency\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59631570\n\nNo one should be in any doubt, there is a tidal wave of Omicron coming\n\nIt is now clear that two doses of vaccine are simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need. \n\nBut the good news is that our scientists are confident that with a third dose, a booster dose, we can all bring our level of protection back up\n\nAt this point our scientists cannot say that Omicron is less severe\n\na wave of Omicron through a population that was not boosted would risk a level of hospitalisation that could overwhelm our NHS and lead sadly to very many deaths\n\nAged 18 and over, in England, third jabs from this week\nThree months since second dose\n\nA third booster dose prevents around 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms

dose sera\n\nAn mRNA booster dose resulted in an increase in neutralising activity irrespective of primary vaccination type\n\nData are urgently required on the durability of neutralising activity \n\nA moderate to high vaccine effectiveness of 70 to 75% is seen in the early period after a booster dose. \n\nWith previous variants, vaccine effectiveness against severe disease, has been higher

Netcare\n\nhttps://www.netcare.co.za\n\nOmicron variant data, Covid-19 symptoms now are far milder than the first three waves\n\nHaving personally seen many of our patients across our Gauteng hospitals,\n\n their symptoms are far milder than anything we experienced during the first three waves\n\nApproximately 90% of Covid-19 patients currently in our hospitals require no form of oxygen therapy,\n\nand are considered incidental cases. \n\nIf this trend continues, it would appear that, with a few exceptions of those requiring tertiary care,\n\nthe fourth wave can be adequately treated at a primary care level\n\nIn the first three waves\n\nNetcare, across 49 acute-care hospitals\n\nTreated 126,000 Covid-19 patients, \n\nof whom,\n\n44% required admission\n\n26% required DC or ICU\n\nSignificantly, all Covid-19 patients admitted were sick and required some form of oxygen therapy. \n\nThe high admission rate, as well as the high percentage of patients requiring ICU or high care is indicative of the severity of cases during the first three waves\n\nNow\n\n337 Covid-19 positive patients admitted\n\n(72% of these patients are in the Gauteng area and 18% in KwaZulu-Natal)\n\nOf these 337,\n\nApproximately 10% are on some form of oxygenation\n\nversus 100% in the first three waves\n\nEight of 337 (2%) are being ventilated of these, \n\ntwo are primary trauma cases\n\nDuring the first three waves\n\nWhen the overall community positivity rate breached 26% across South Africa\n\nFirst wave admissions\n2,000\n\nSecond wave admissions\n2,500\n\nThird wave admissions\n3,000\n\nFourth (omicron) wave admissions\n337\n\nOf the patients admitted to Netcare hospitals and facilities since 15 November\n\n75% not vaccinated\n\nSeven deaths in Netcare facilities due to Covid-19 complications\n\nAge distribution of patients\n\nCovid-19 patients admitted since 15 November are on average younger than those seen during the first three waves,\n\n71% being 50 years\n\nAverage age of 38.5 years\n\nPatients presentations\n\nMild to moderate flu-like symptoms\n\nBlocked or runny nose\n\nHeadache\n\nScratchy or sore throat\n\nIt is our considered view at this early stage that, \nshould this trend continue, \n\nCovid-19 may be effectively managed at a primary care level, \n\nwith the exception of certain cases requiring admission to tertiary facilities\n\nDr Fareed Abdullah, Office of Aids and TB Research, SA Medical Research Council\n\n80% of admissions below the age of 50 years,\n\nthroughout the Gauteng province in the last two weeks\n\nThe best indicator of disease severity is measured by the in-hospital death rate.\n\nThere were 10 deaths in the in the past two weeks (cohort of 166)\n\nmaking up 6.6% of the 166 admissions\n\n(23% for all previous waves)\n\nFour deaths, aged 26-36\n\nFive deaths, aged over 60\n\nThere were no Covid-19-related deaths among 34 admissions in the paediatric Covid wards over the last two weeks\n\nOmicron variant could act as a natural vaccine\n\nProfessor Eleanor Riley, immunology and infectious diseases, University of Edinburgh\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/covid-news-booster-cases-vaccine-passport-coronavirus-omicron2/\n\nOmicron variant could act as a natural vaccine in the unvaccinated\n\nBritons are very likely to contract the variant in the next couple of weeks\n\nEverybody\u2019s very likely to experience it in the next few weeks. \n\nIf it is milder, and we know infection induces an immune response, \n\nit is possible that this could act as a natural vaccine, \ngetting to those people who have so far been unwilling to be vaccinated\n\nBut I think we have to exercise a huge degree of caution with that, \n\nbecause there\u2019s a huge \u2018if\u2019 about this \u2018is it milder?\u2019 \n\nAnd I think it\u2019s very dangerous to compare data from South Africa to the UK. \n\nIn the South African population there\u2019s been so many waves of infection they\u2019ve gone through, \n\nlots of immunity and a much younger population\n\nAdvised people to
