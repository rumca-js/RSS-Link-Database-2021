I invited Rohin from @MedlifeCrisis, Sophie from @SophsNotes, @MikeBoyd, Sam from @Wendoverproductions, and @MiaMulder to play some games. They'll be tempted by individual profit over group wealth, in an environment designed to slowly break their team apart. But all they knew is: they'd be sat around a table trying to win cash: over $10,000. This is a show about trust, about loyalty... and about Money.

This was originally a five-episode series for Nebula: for this free-to-air release, it's been combined into a single omnibus episode. The changes are limited to: cutting the "previously on" sections; adjusting the music to cleanly bridge episodes; and combining all the credits into one end-of-the-series set.
