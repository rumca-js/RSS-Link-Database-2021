Five games. $10,000. \u22ee Money: the full series", "description": "I invited Rohin from @MedlifeCrisis, Sophie from @SophsNotes, @MikeBoyd, Sam from @Wendoverproductions, and @MiaMulder to play some games. They'll be tempted by individual profit over group wealth, in an environment designed to slowly break their team apart. But all they knew is: they'd be sat around a table trying to win cash: over $10,000. This is a show about trust, about loyalty... and about Money.\n\nGames Producer: David Bodycombe\nGames AP: Liam MacLeod\nProduction Assistant: Molly Williams\nRunners: Edward Hubbard, Alice Rostant\nDealer: Chahna Windross\n\nCamera operators: Jamie MacLeod, Aidan Bryan, Elisa Spigariol, Ami Bevilacqua\nCamera trainee: William Davis\nDIT: Rachel Hutchings\nStills Photography: James Gowdy\nGaffer: Marc Spicer\nSpark: Jamie Montgomery\nLighting Trainee: Luigi Truscelli\nSound Operators: Tom Bartlett, Ollie Drummond\nGraphic Design: Simon Buckmanster, Kate Willaert\n\nMotion Graphics: Dom Burgess, Elsie Heersink, Josh Sherrington\nComposer: Benjamin Squires\nEditor: Jamie MacLeod\nEdit Assistant: Rachel Hutchings\nColourist: Ciaran O'Brien\nSound Mixer: Dan Pugsley\nProduction Designer: Louis Grant\n\nSpecial thanks: Khyan Mansley, Edith Windle, Caroline Hardman, Chris Dickson, Charlotte Dann, Grace Lee, Graeme Cole, Howard Swains, Jonathan Richards, Jonathan Warschauer, Joshua Felix, Kav Benepal, Mark Norman Francis, Matt Gray, Michelle Martin, Nat Aves, Nick Gates, Rita Wilcox, Ross Hroff, Sally Le Page, Tim Hall\n\nDirector of Photography: Ciaran O'Brien\nProducer: Ashley Horne\nSeries Director: Sammy Paul\nSeries Producer: Cambria Bailey-Jones\nExecutive Producers: Guy Larsen, Tom Scott\n\nEpisode 1: This game is inspired by the Platonia Dilemma, from Douglas Hofstadter's book Metamagical Themas.\nEpisode 3: This game is inspired by the Public Goods Game, a standard of experimental economics.\nEpisode 5: This game is inspired by the Ultimatum Game, first described by G\u00fcth et al in 1982.\n\nA Nebula Original\nA Penny4 Production\n\u00a9 Pad 26 Limited MMXX\n\nThis was originally a five-episode series for Nebula: for this free-to-air release, it's been combined into a single omnibus episode.
