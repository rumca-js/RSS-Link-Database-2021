the symptoms are. \n\nSlightly blocked feeling, feeling of being  a little ill for one day, slight  headache, no cough or runny nose.  \n \nThis  surprised me  because I havebeen   practicing  \nextreme isolation. \n\nI live alone (by choice), and only visited the supermarket during off  hours, twice in the past 7-10 days. \n \nAmazing that I got this.\n \nI started with 4000 IU of D per day about three or four weeks ago. \n\nAnd 15 mcg daily of zinc. \n\nWho knows this may explain the mild symptom set. \n\nUS cases and deaths

balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses. \n\nThese updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives. \n\nPrevention is our best option: get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial and high community transmission, and take a test before you gather.\n\nUS

TO CONTACT TRACING, QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION PROTOCOLS:

and/or vaccination is high,\n\nPast infection in 60-80% in several sero-surveys\n\nContainment strategies are no longer appropriate \u2013 mitigation is the only viable strategy\n\nNew knowledge about the virus\n\nHigh proportion of asymptomatic disease\n\nHigh degree of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread\n\nAerosol spread\n\nOnly a small proportion of cases are diagnosed\n\nTesting\n\nTesting skewed towards symptomatic (minority)\n\nNot all symptomatic people test\n\nNot all negative tests are true negatives\n\nQuarantine has been costly\n \nThus, the following is applicable with immediate effect:\n \nAll contact tracing be stopped with immediate effect,\n\nexcept in congregate settings and cluster outbreak situations or self-contained\n\nAll contacts must continue with their normal duties with heightened monitoring\n\n(daily temperature testing, symptom screening) of any early signs. \n\nIf they develop symptoms then they should be tested and be managed according to the severity of the symptoms\n\nAll contacts must not be tested unless if they develop symptoms\n \nQuarantining for contacts of confirmed cases of Covid -19\n\nAll quarantine is to be stopped with immediate effect\n\nThis applies to both vaccinated and unvaccinated contacts\n\nNo testing for Covid -19 is required irrespective of the risk exposure unless the contact becomes symptomatic\n \nIsolation\n\nAsymptomatic Individuals\n\nNo isolation period required\n\nSelf-observation for 5-7 days,\n\nMild disease\n\nFever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of taste and smell.\n\nIsolation period is maintained at 8\n\nThere is no need for Covid-19 test (either PCR or antigen test) be performed prior to returning to work\n\nSevere disease\n\nExacerbated symptoms, shortness of breath, dyspnoea, chest pain, abnormal chest imaging, require hospitalisation", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HN6cIfp5T4",
