In this video, we\u2019re testing unexpected physics, seeing if even more things can pierce Dozer\u2019s shield, learning Ranger is no good boy, and messing with guns, rockets, and explosives.\n\nWelcome back to more Battlefield 2042 mythbusting. The latest game by DICE may have had a very rocky and buggy launch, but that\u2019s an even better reason to test the limits of specialists, gadgets, and some wonky physics. While you\u2019re waiting for some massive patches to come in with more than 150 fixes, join us as we have some fun with the game\u2019s brokenness.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to see if you can be killed by a flying decapitated tank turret, if you can break your fall by grappling the ground, if anything can pierce Dozer\u2019s shield, and what Irish\u2019s grenade and rocket interceptor actually stops. We\u2019re also going to show you how to stop those overpowered hovercraft, see if smoke can save you from Paik\u2019s scan, try to revive through floors, and mess with some explosives. We\u2019d love to do even more tests, so tell us what you would like us to try with specialists, gadgets, guns, or physics.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 is out now on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC.
