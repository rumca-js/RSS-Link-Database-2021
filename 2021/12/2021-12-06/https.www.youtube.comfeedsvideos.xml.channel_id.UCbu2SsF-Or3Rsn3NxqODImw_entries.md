Battlefield 2042 specialists aren’t very popular, but that doesn’t mean we can’t push them to the limit. In this video, we’re testing unexpected physics, seeing if even more things can pierce Dozer’s shield, learning Ranger is no good boy, and messing with guns, rockets, and explosives.

Welcome back to more Battlefield 2042 mythbusting. The latest game by DICE may have had a very rocky and buggy launch, but that’s an even better reason to test the limits of specialists, gadgets, and some wonky physics. While you’re waiting for some massive patches to come in with more than 150 fixes, join us as we have some fun with the game’s brokenness.

In this video, we’re going to see if you can be killed by a flying decapitated tank turret, if you can break your fall by grappling the ground, if anything can pierce Dozer’s shield, and what Irish’s grenade and rocket interceptor actually stops. We’re also going to show you how to stop those overpowered hovercraft, see if smoke can save you from Paik’s scan, try to revive through floors, and mess with some explosives. We’d love to do even more tests, so tell us what you would like us to try with specialists, gadgets, guns, or physics. 

Battlefield 2042 is out now on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC. Make sure to head on over to GameSpot.com and stay here on youtube.com/gamespot for ongoing coverage, including Season 1 starting in 2022, the new Exposure map, and a recent DICE shakeup putting Titanfall/Apex Boss Vince Zampella in charge.

In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Halo Infinite Boss Explains What Went Wrong With The 2020 Campaign Demo, Halo Infinite Is Adding More Playlists Soon, But Slayer Isn't Ready Yet and details about Call of Duty Warzone’s Pacific map launch.  

In this video, DeVante talks about what went wrong with Halo Infinite’s 2020 demo. 343’s Bonnie Ross explained because developers were mostly working from home at the time due to the pandemic and not everyone working on the game saw the same picture quality for the demo.

DeVante also talks about when Halo Infinite’s multiplayer will get additional playlists.  Fiesta, Tactical Slayer (SWAT), and Free-For-All are on the way, however they won't be in the game on December 8 when the campaign launches.  

Later in the video, DeVante talks about Call of Duty: Warzone finally getting its long-awaited new Pacific-themed map this week and how players can get early access.
