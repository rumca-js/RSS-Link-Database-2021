Yes\n\nOmicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates substantial population-level evidence for evasion of immunity from prior infection. \n\nRetrospective analysis of routine epidemiological surveillance data \n\n4th March 2020 to 27th November 2021\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s National Notifiable Medical Conditions Surveillance System \n\nN = 2,796,982\n\nLaboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2\n\nResults\n\n35,670 suspected reinfections were identified \n\namong 2,796,982 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2,\n\nwho had a positive test result at least 90 days prior to 27th November 2021\n\n35,670 individuals with at least two infections\n\n332 individuals with third infections\n\n1 individual with four infection\n\nThe relative hazard ratio for wave 2 versus wave 1 was 0.75\n\nThe relative hazard ratio for wave 3 versus wave 1 was 0.71\n\nRelative hazard ratio for the period from 01 November 2021 to 27 November 2021\n\nThe relative hazard ratio for wave 4 versus wave 1 was 2.39\n\nIn the time of beta and delta\n\nIncreases in primary infections\n\nNo corresponding increase in reinfection hazard\n\nIn the time of omicron\n\nOmicron variant, decrease in the hazard for primary infection\n\nIncrease in reinfection hazard coefficient\n\nConclusion\n\nPopulation-level evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection. \n\nIn contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta variants. \n\nThis finding has important implications for public health planning, \n\nparticularly in countries like South Africa with high rates of immunity from prior infection. \n\nUrgent questions remain regarding whether Omicron is also able to evade vaccine-induced immunity,\n\nand the potential implications on protection against severe disease and death. \n\nProf Paul Hunter\n\nThe implications of this paper are that Omicron will be able to overcome natural and probably vaccine-induced immunity to a significant degree.\n \nBut, the degree is still unclear - though it is doubtful that this will represent complete escape.\n\nProf Francois Balloux, University College London\n\nThe higher estimated re-infection ability of the Omicron variant to cause re-infection is not overly surprising\n\nand could be largely anticipated based on the large number of mutations in the spike protein carried by the omicron variant, \n\nwhich increase the Omicron variant's ability to bypass host immunity", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ml9kYeOPeg", "date_published": "2021-12-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Australia omicron and vaccinations", "description": "Special report on omicron and vaccination in Australia.
