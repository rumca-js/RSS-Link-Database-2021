Mr. Beast's Squid Game In Real Life had people discussing on twitter, and as with all things on Twitter, the worst takes surfaced and made me want to respond.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
