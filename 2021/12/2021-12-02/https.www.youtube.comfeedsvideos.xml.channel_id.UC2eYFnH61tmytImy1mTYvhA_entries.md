I got this luxury car for less than $2,000 with persistence and luck. This is my Lexus ES 330.

Earlier this year, I didn't know anything about cars, despite needing a new one. I asked subscribers and most all said I should look into getting a Toyota/Lexus or Honda/Acura for a long-lasting low-maintenance used car.
