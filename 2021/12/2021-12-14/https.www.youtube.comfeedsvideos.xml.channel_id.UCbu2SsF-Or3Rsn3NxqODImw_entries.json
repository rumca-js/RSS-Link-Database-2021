Alan Wake II will, however, skew more towards traditional survival-horror, a twist on the original's more psychological horror focus.\n\nLater in the video, Persia talks about Halo content creator Mint Blitz who shows how a new speedrunning trick is done, in which he credits the discovery of the skip to members of the Haloruns speedrunning community. What's notable about the skip is that it doesn't seem all that difficult to accomplish and lets you jump from the Excavation Site to the second to last mission of the campaign. Link to the full video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ8g9XkutRY\u00a0\n\nLastly, Persia goes over the new games that come to Xbox Game Pass for December. These games include Mortal Kombat 11, The Gunk, Broken Age, and more starting December 16th. Game Pass users will also be able to play DLC and game updates for Ark: Survival Evolved, Minecraft Dungeons, and The Elder Scrolls Online.\n\nFor more information on all of our topics, please visit gamespot.com.\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro - 00:00\nAlan Wake II -\u00a000:07\nHalo Infinite - 01:07\nXbox Game Pass - 02:47\nOutro - 03:37", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZbxQukbrlg", "date_published": "2021-12-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnar\u00f6k Everything We Know So Far", "description": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla is getting a whole second year of post-launch content, kicking off with the Crossover Stories DLC that see Odyssey's Kassandra and Valhalla's Eivor meet.

In this video, we break down our time spent with Sloclap's press preview build.\n\nThe hands-on preview build we were given only features a small slice of what's to come when the full game releases in February, yet this is still more than enough to showcase the depth and potential brilliance of Sifu's hand-to-hand action. A back alley nightclub provides the setting for this single-level preview, its ambience shifting as you move between neon-lit social areas and dim backstage corridors. \n\nMuch like the martial arts movies that inspired it, Sifu often positions you as a lone fighter facing off against an overwhelming number of foes. This is the case in most games, of course, and at first glance, the setup for Sifu's brawls looks reminiscent of the Batman: Arkham games. The similarities basically end there, though. Sifu's combat is grounded in reality by comparison. You'll barely scrape by in most encounters, even when utilizing the full potential of your fighting skills, awareness of the environment, and ingenuity.\n\nSlocap says there will be story connotations related to your rapid aging and the price of vengeance, but this isn't present in the preview build. Instead, this snapshot of the game offers a brief glimpse of the intriguing elements wrapped around its rousing combat. My anticipation for Sifu was already high just based on its trailers, but after getting a taste I can't wait for more. Sifu releases on February 22, 2022 for PS4, PS5, and PC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grRWcVNeg4g", "date_published": "2021-12-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Splinter Cell Remake - Stepping Out of the Shadows | Developer Presentation", "description": "Check out the developer presentation revealing the Splinter Cell Remake!
