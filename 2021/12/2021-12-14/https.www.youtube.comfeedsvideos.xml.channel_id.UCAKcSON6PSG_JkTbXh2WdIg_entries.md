Mary Lucia discusses the film "Passing," now streaming on Netflix and starring Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga, directed by Rebecca Hall. The film is based on a novel of the same name that was published in 1929, and the story looks at the theme of African Americans who are light skinned enough that they could pass as white, told through the story of two childhood friends who reunite as adults, when one of the friends is indeed passing.

"It's such an intimate examination of race," Mary says. "It is so fascinating. It is so thoughtful. I can't recommend it enough."
