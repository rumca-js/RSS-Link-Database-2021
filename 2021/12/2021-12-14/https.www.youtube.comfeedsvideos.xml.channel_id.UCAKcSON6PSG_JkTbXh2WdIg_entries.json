The film is based on a novel of the same name that was published in 1929, and the story looks at the theme of African Americans who are light skinned enough that they could pass as white, told through the story of two childhood friends who reunite as adults, when one of the friends is indeed passing.\n\n\"It's such an intimate examination of race,\" Mary says. \"It is so fascinating. It is so thoughtful. I can't recommend it enough.\"\n\nLISTEN TO LOOCH PLAYLIST:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYClJc3TpV5J_sXyCfes-p6vCgOpCmleh\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#passingfilm", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuqJWOrfYXI", "date_published": "2021-12-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Amos Lee - Into The Clearing (live performance for The Current)", "description": "Singer-songwriter Amos Lee performs \"Into The Clearing\" from his upcoming 2022 record \"Dreamland\" for The Current. \n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#AmosLee", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C9IsmJPflw", "date_published": "2021-12-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Amos Lee - Madison (live performance for The Current)", "description": "Singer-songwriter Amos Lee joins The Current to share a performance of \"Madison,\" an unreleased track which will appear on a yet-to-be-announced album\u2014Lee noted that he \"got a good backlog of songs\" written during the pandemic.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#AmosLee", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl4wfuP4GT8", "date_published": "2021-12-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Amos Lee - Worry No More (live performance for The Current)", "description": "Singer-songwriter Amos Lee performs \"Worry No More\" from his upcoming 2022 record \"Dreamland\" for The Current. \n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#AmosLee", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_8ZeNCOcqQ", "date_published": "2021-12-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Amos Lee plays songs from \"Dreamland\" & more (live performance for The Current)", "description": "Singer-songwriter Amos Lee joins The Current to play two new songs from his upcoming 2022 record \"Dreamland,\" plus an unreleased track which will appear on a yet-to-be-announced album\u2014Lee noted that he \"got a good backlog of songs\" written during the pandemic.\n\nSongs Played:\n00:01 Worry No More\n03:11 Into The Clearing\n06:51 Madison\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#AmosLee", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFD0BbRCjg4", "date_published": "2021-12-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
