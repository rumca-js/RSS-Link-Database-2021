the delta\n\nMillion cases per day by end of December\n\nProfessor Graham Medley, infectious disease modelling, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\nThe number of infections means that even

rapid community spread\n\nThe Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2\n\nFuelling South Africa\u2019s fourth wave\n\nGenomic Surveillance, Omicron over 90% of new infections\n\nHas displaced Delta variant\n\nThe Omicron-driven fourth wave has a significantly steeper trajectory of new infections relative to prior waves. \n\nNational data show an exponential increase in both new infections and test positivity rates\n\n\nVaccine effectiveness during the current Omicron wave\n\nSAMRC, n= 211,000 positive tests\n\n41% from adult members who had received two doses of the Pfizer\n\n78,000 of these COVID-19 test results were attributed to Omicron infections\n\nTo-date laboratory analysis has provided early insights into potential reduction in the effect of neutralising antibodies against the Omicron variant\n\nTwo doses of the Pfizer\n\nTwo-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination provides significant protection against hospitalisation in individuals with Omicron variant infection \n\n33% protection against infection, relative to the unvaccinated\n\n(down from 80% protection against infection)\n\n70% protection against hospital admission\n\n(down from 93% with delta)\n\nProtection against hospital admission is maintained across all ages\n\nProtection against admission is consistent across a range of chronic illnesses\n\nDiabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular diseases\n\nReinfection risk\n\nOmicron reinfection risk significantly higher compared to prior variants\n\nOverall, the risk of re-infection (following prior infection) has increased over time\nInfected with Delta, a 40% relative risk of reinfection with Omicron\n\nInfected with Beta, a 60% relative risk of reinfection with Omicron\n\nInfected in first wave, a 73% risk of reinfection\n\nRisk of severe disease and hospitalisation significantly lower in Omicron infection compared to prior variants\n\nThis lesser severity could, however, be confounded by the high seroprevalence levels of SARS CoV-2 antibodies in the general South African population\n\nRisk of hospital admission among adults diagnosed with omicron is 29% lower\n\nHospitalised adults, lower propensity to be admitted to high-care and intensive-care units, relative to prior waves\n\nPreliminary observations on Omicron experience in children\n\nUnder 18 have a 20% higher risk of admission when infected with Omicron\n\nAlso increase in admissions for children under five\n\nMany are incidentally discovered in hospital\n\nChildren were 51% less likely to test positive for COVID-19 relative to adults in the Omicron period\n\nWhere children require admission for complications of COVID-19\n\nBronchiolitis\n\nPneumonia\n\nSevere gastrointestinal symptoms and dehydration\n\nThe
