Mary Lucia was on her annual holiday visit to New York City when the news came down that one of Mary's personal heroes, writer Joan Didion, had died. Coincidentally — or perhaps not — Mary had just happened to bring along Didion's book "The Year of Magical Thinking."

Reflecting on Didion's life, Mary recommends the documentary "Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold," available on Netflix and directed by Didion's nephew, Griffin Dunne. "It's really a beautiful look at her life," Mary says. "How she dealt with some impossible loss, [yet] kept her creativity, her wit, her unique vision."

Watch more of what Mary Lucia has to say in the video above.
