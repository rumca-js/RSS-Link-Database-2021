Today, I present my recommended Reading Order for all of JRR Tolkien's books on Middle-earth!  My philosophy is to make it as easy a transition into the more difficult books (like The Silmarillion) as possible.  In so doing, I've recommended a reading order that goes by difficulty and books that contain the most narrative content.
