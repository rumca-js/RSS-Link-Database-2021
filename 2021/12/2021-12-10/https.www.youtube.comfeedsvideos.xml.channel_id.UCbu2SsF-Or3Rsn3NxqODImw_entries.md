FromSoftware bestowed us with a brand new Elden Ring Trailer at The Game Awards. In the latest Elden Ring trailer, FromSoftware took a break from gameplay to show us Elden Ring Lore and what could be the Elden Ring Intro Cinematic. So, Dave Klein of DaveControl took a stab at breaking down some lore theories and speculation based on the newest Elden Ring trailer. Elden Ring releases February 25, 2022.

FromSoftware is the acclaimed company behind classics like King's Field, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. Ever since Hidetaka Miyazaki has taken over, FromSoftware has gone from being an obscure developer to one of the most well known and respected. Their latest title, Elden Ring, is one of the most anticipated games of 2022 and is looking fantastic.

Kurt Indovina is very excited about Alan Wake 2. Not just because it's a long awaited sequel, but because Remedy Entertainment is going full-fledged survival horror.

It's been over a decade since we've had the chance to explore the dark and mysterious corners of Bright Falls, but we won't have to wait much longer. During the 2021 Game Awards, Remedy Entertainment revealed the teaser trailer or Alan Wake 2, expected to release in 2023. Sam Lake (writer of Max Payne, Alan Wake, and Control), joined the stage with Geoff Keighley to announce that Alan Wake II will be the studios first full-fledged survival horror game.

For Kurt Indovina, this was very good news. In the above video, Kurt expresses his excitement for the announcement, but also explains Remedy's trail of games since Alan Wake's release over a decade ago, and how all the pieces are in place for its return.
