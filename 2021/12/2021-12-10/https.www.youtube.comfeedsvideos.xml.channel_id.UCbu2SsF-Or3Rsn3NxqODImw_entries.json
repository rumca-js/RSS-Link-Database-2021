In the latest Elden Ring trailer, FromSoftware took a break from gameplay to show us Elden Ring Lore and what could be the Elden Ring Intro Cinematic. So, Dave Klein of DaveControl took a stab at breaking down some lore theories and speculation based on the newest Elden Ring trailer. Elden Ring releases February 25, 2022.\n\nFromSoftware is the acclaimed company behind classics like King's Field, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. Ever since Hidetaka Miyazaki has taken over, FromSoftware has gone from being an obscure developer to one of the most well known and respected. Their latest title, Elden Ring, is one of the most anticipated games of 2022 and is looking fantastic.\n\n#EldenRing", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uGRjOU8giI", "date_published": "2021-12-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Halo Infinite Campaign | Launch Xbox One VS Xbox Series X Graphics & Loading Time Comparison", "description": "How does Halo Infinite stack up when comparing it on the weakest modern Xbox system (Xbox One), to the strongest (Series X)?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6fLHwjifnw", "date_published": "2021-12-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Game Awards: What To Be Excited For Next | GameSpot News", "description": "In today\u2019s GameSpot News, Persia goes over The Game Awards and some of its biggest reveals, how you can play The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine demo now, and more. \n\nAlan Wake II, Wonder Woman, and Star Wars: Eclipse were among some of the biggest reveals at The Game Awards with many other trailers showing off new gameplay for titles previously announced.
