Fallout 3 is one of my favourite games from my YOUTH. It still holds up, which is enough given how old it is, but I think even for the time it messed a few things up. I also feel like Fallout: New Vegas kind of tainted it a little by showing us how Fallout really should have been done. 

My current plan now is to do the Fallout 3 DLC, a secret extra Fallout 3 video, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, and maybe some other stragglers. This will take me years. 

I then might do the Metroid series, I plan on doing it, it just depends if I will do it next. In between these videos I have some science and history videos in the works I will likely do: Game video, science video, game video, science, and so on.
