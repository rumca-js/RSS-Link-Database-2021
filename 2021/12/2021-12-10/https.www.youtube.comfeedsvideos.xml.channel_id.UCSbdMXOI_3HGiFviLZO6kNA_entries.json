Today I have a video on my favorite full body tracking solution that I have been waiting more than a year for. TUNDRA TRACKERS! Here in this video I show off the tracking quality, the pros and cons of Tundra Trackers and also dabble a little bit with concepts of full body tracking in general!\n\nTundras have become my go to tracker for VRChat and Neos and I have grown to use them just about every day sometimes from full charge to dead. Hopefully you enjoy this video! By the way if you do want to buy Tundras they will become available again to purchase likely in February.\n\nHere is more information on them:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tundralabs/tundra-tracker\n\nMy links:\nTwitch.tv/Thrilluwu\nDiscord.gg/Thrill\nTwitter.com/Thrilluwu\nPatreon.com/Thrillseeker\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00 INTRO\n00:52 What are Tundra Trackers?\n01:47 Type of Full Body Tracking in VR\n02:17 Weight and Size\n03:15 Battery Life\n04:15 Tracking Quality/ Occlusion\n05:58 MY FAVORITE PART OF TUNDRA TRACKER\n07:12 How to get the BEST tracking possible\n9:15 Longevity \n10:20 The biggest problem with Tundra Trackers\n11:09 Twitch stream with Tundras \n11:37 Pretty Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohzJkvHHqc", "date_published": "2021-12-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
