The National Institute for Communicable Diseases

The percentage of positive tests nationally:

24.9% (16.4%) higher than last week

Gauteng, 35%

Limpopo, 32.7%

Mpumalanga, 26.9%

North West, 26.0%

Free State, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, 10% to 15%

Eastern Cape and Northern Cape, less than 10%

Omicron variant data, Covid-19 symptoms now are far milder than the first three waves

Having personally seen many of our patients across our Gauteng hospitals,

 their symptoms are far milder than anything we experienced during the first three waves

Approximately 90% of Covid-19 patients currently in our hospitals require no form of oxygen therapy,

and are considered incidental cases. 

If this trend continues, it would appear that, with a few exceptions of those requiring tertiary care,

the fourth wave can be adequately treated at a primary care level

In the first three waves

Netcare, across 49 acute-care hospitals

Treated 126,000 Covid-19 patients, 

of whom,

44% required admission

26% required DC or ICU

Significantly, all Covid-19 patients admitted were sick and required some form of oxygen therapy. 

The high admission rate, as well as the high percentage of patients requiring ICU or high care is indicative of the severity of cases during the first three waves

Now

337 Covid-19 positive patients admitted

(72% of these patients are in the Gauteng area and 18% in KwaZulu-Natal)

Of these 337,

Approximately 10% are on some form of oxygenation

versus 100% in the first three waves

Eight of 337 (2%) are being ventilated of these, 

two are primary trauma cases

During the first three waves

When the overall community positivity rate breached 26% across South Africa

First wave admissions
2,000

Second wave admissions
2,500

Third wave admissions
3,000

Fourth (omicron) wave admissions
337

Of the patients admitted to Netcare hospitals and facilities since 15 November

75% not vaccinated

Seven deaths in Netcare facilities due to Covid-19 complications

Age distribution of patients

Covid-19 patients admitted since 15 November are on average younger than those seen during the first three waves,

71% being 50 years

Average age of 38.5 years

Patients presentations

Mild to moderate flu-like symptoms

Blocked or runny nose

Headache

Scratchy or sore throat

It is our considered view at this early stage that, 
should this trend continue, 

Covid-19 may be effectively managed at a primary care level, 

with the exception of certain cases requiring admission to tertiary facilities

Dr Fareed Abdullah, Office of Aids and TB Research, SA Medical Research Council

80% of admissions below the age of 50 years,

throughout the Gauteng province in the last two weeks

The best indicator of disease severity is measured by the in-hospital death rate.

There were 10 deaths in the in the past two weeks (cohort of 166)

making up 6.6% of the 166 admissions

(23% for all previous waves)

Four deaths, aged 26-36

Five deaths, aged over 60

There were no Covid-19-related deaths among 34 admissions in the paediatric Covid wards over the last two weeks

Omicron variant could act as a natural vaccine

Professor Eleanor Riley, immunology and infectious diseases, University of Edinburgh

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/covid-news-booster-cases-vaccine-passport-coronavirus-omicron2/

Omicron variant could act as a natural vaccine in the unvaccinated

Britons are very likely to contract the variant in the next couple of weeks

Everybody’s very likely to experience it in the next few weeks. 

If it is milder, and we know infection induces an immune response, 

it is possible that this could act as a natural vaccine, 
getting to those people who have so far been unwilling to be vaccinated

But I think we have to exercise a huge degree of caution with that, 

because there’s a huge ‘if’ about this ‘is it milder?’ 

And I think it’s very dangerous to compare data from South Africa to the UK. 

In the South African population there’s been so many waves of infection they’ve gone through, 

lots of immunity and a much younger population

Advised people to act on the basis that anybody they come into contact with could have coronavirus

Omicron is displaying a significant growth advantage over Delta, 

likely to outcompete Delta in the UK and become the dominant variant.

If the growth rate and doubling time continue,

at least 50% of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases to be caused by Omicron variant by mid-December

One million by end of December

1% = 10,000

Omicron displays a reduction in protection offered by having had a previous infection or vaccination.

There is insufficient data to make any assessment of protection against severe disease, 

or to assess the severity of illness caused by Omicron. 

Further studies are underway in the UK and abroad.

Hospital admissions from Omicron should be expected to follow soon (high confidence).

Though there remain some important uncertainties, 

Early verbal reports indicate that hospitalisations due to Omicron are now increasing in South Africa.

The doubling time for new Omicron infections is currently around 3 days in England

It is unlikely to be any slower than a 5-day doubling time (high confidence)

Household studies show higher secondary attack rates (high confidence).

Why is omicron more transmissible?

Combinations of transmissibility and immune escape

Some early indications from South Africa suggest less severe disease in those hospitalised

A modest reduction in severity would not avert high numbers of hospitalisations if growth rates remained very high.

One thousand per day be end of month

The peak is highly likely to be higher than 1,000 to 2,000 Omicron hospital admissions per day without intervention

For it to be below this level there would need to be only a small degree of immune escape and very high protection from boosters against Omicron

With very rapid doubling times a large wave could occur leading to synchronous absences from work.

With lags of the order of two or more weeks, 

and doubling times of the order of three days, 

it is likely that, once hospitalisations begin to increase at a rate similar to that of cases, 

four doublings (a 16-fold increase) or more could already be “in the system”

A greater role for airborne transmission
Ventilation, well-fitting masks and distancing or reduced density of people in indoor environments may be even more important.

Michael

In your talk about the Oslo party you embrace another wrong inference that many people like to believe, 

that claims that viruses tend to become less lethal because “not killing their host” keeps the viruses in the host alive too

and enables the host to keep infecting, making the virus more contagious. 

This claim may be contested even in the general case, 

but it’s certainly wrong for SARS-COV 2 since as you pointed out many times – 

the death of the victim almost always happens after he is no longer infectious 

and this means that prolonging the life of the victim does not prolong the period of infectivity.
