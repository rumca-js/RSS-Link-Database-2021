That's ok, I got lots of reverb, I'd rather play with it like it's a crazy friend.\n\nSo this jam was a test of how Erbe sounds on drums. I added a TON of new samples to my Erica Synth Sample Drum and will be doing a lot more drum loop worth with it.\n\nNebulae is also in play, since I just make a bunch of new samples for it using the Native Instruments Arkhis Kontant Library.\n\nHere's a list of everything being used: \n\nVoices\nKlavis Twin Waves MkII: http://bit.ly/pc_twin_waves\nQu-Bit Scanned: https://bit.ly/3xuf0uZ\nQu-Bit Nebulae: https://bit.ly/3uX7DKI\n4ms Ensemble Oscillator:  https://bit.ly/33TzPmd\n\nDrums\nErica Synths Sample Drum: http://bit.ly/pc_sample_drum\nVPME QD: http://bit.ly/pc_VPME_QD\n\nEffects\nAfter Later Monsoon:  http://bit.ly/pc_after_later\nMake Noise Erbe Verb: https://bit.ly/3o8KCSI\nHologram Microcosm: https://bit.ly/3tEVxEJ\n4ms Tapographic Delay: https://bit.ly/2RKConD\n\n\nUtility\nIntellijel Quadrax: http://bit.ly/pc_quadrax\nIntellijel Quad VCA: http://bit.ly/pc_quadvca\nPamela's New Workout: https://bit.ly/2QRxnZO\nWMD Metron: https://bit.ly/3eKLaLC\nKeystep Pro:  https://bit.ly/3uMKLNY\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching.
