Zelda BOTW has had another amazing year of discoveries. Max takes Zelda fans through some of the best glitches of 2021, including one that gives you 80,000+ arrows and others that provide a new way to fly, the ability to lift heavy objects, and even a first-person mode!

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 is said to release in 2022. But while we wait, Max--aka RinHara5aki--is still going strong with the original Breath of the Wild, covering both Things You STILL Didn't Know In Zelda Breath Of The Wild and amazing exploits and glitches found by the community. In this video, we’re covering the most impactful finds of 2021.

In January, players continued to build on the Memory Storage glitch, finding a way to allow players to have 80,000 arrows. They also discovered Yiga Blademasters could be made to pull the Master Sword out of its pedestal. In March, players sorted out how to play the game from a first-person perspective and how to lift extremely heavy objects. 

June was a huge month, with discoveries ranging from finally getting to an impossible-to-reach chest, to placing bombs inside objects and finding better ways to duplicate objects using Octoballoons. In September, players had figured out new ways to speedrun the game by moving through the world without using stamina. By the end of the year, glitch hunters had even sorted out how to get rid of the Sheikah Slate entirely, proving Link’s mind powers are enough to use rune abilities.

If you love the The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sandbox like we do, head on over to YouTube.com/GameSpot to discover hundreds of tips, tricks, glitches, and exploits, including 33 Amazing Ways To Fly In Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Happy Holidays!

Gaming shotguns come in many shapes and sizes, from the archetypal Remington 870 seen in the likes of Resident Evil and Battlefield 2042, to the sci-fi styled SPAS-12 that inspired Aliens’ iconic Pulse Rifle. Whether they’re packing double barrels or drum magazines, shotguns have made quite the impact on our pop culture. But how close are the shotguns found in our games to the real-world weapons they represent?

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson about the breadth and variety of shotguns, from the classic double-barrelled flintlocks through to the ridiculous revolving Striker shotgun.
