They are among the most mysterious creatures in Tolkien's Middle-earth.  The Watcher in the Water and the Nameless Things of Moria are glimpsed and mentioned in passages, and are even said to be unknown to Sauron.  Likely a byproduct of the creation of the world, these creatures found refuge in the depths of Moria until one would escape to haunt the entrance to Khazad-dûm!
