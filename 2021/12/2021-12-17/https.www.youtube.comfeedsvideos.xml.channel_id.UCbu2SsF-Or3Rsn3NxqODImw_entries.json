Player two has no HUD. The game's FOBs (Forward Operating Bases) are completely busted, and if either player dies, the game locks up. Trying to enable co-op may also break Halo Infinite game saves.\u00a0\n\nDeVante also talks about how the upcoming Halo TV series will not play around within any of the established canon and will instead tell its story in what it calls the \"Silver Timeline.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLHpbxa4v3o", "date_published": "2021-12-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "I Played the GTA Trilogy 20 Years Later...", "description": "The GTA Trilogy: Definitive Edition is finally out, and not quite what everyone was hoping for.
