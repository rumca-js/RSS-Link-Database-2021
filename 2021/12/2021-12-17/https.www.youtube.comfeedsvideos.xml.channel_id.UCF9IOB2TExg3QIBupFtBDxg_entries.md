Thanks to Marianna and DW. This would have been a better answer to the question I messed up:
Two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination provides some protection against symptomatic infection with omicron, but significant protection against hospitalisation (South Africa data)

33% protection against infection with omicron, relative to the unvaccinated

(down from 80% protection against infection with delta)

70% protection against hospital admission in omicron infection, relative to the unvaccinated

(down from 93% protection with delta)

the medical people I interact with at the hospital are far more optimistic than I've seen them since this all began in April last year

Nobody want's to tempt fate or speak to loudly just yet ,,,its like walking on egg shells at the moment ‚Äì 

But there are open beds and they're not filling up just yet  - in fact there are 2 more beds now than last weekend.

Kind regards,

When you have a larger number of people getting infected, the total amount of hospitalizations is going to be more. That's just simple math 





Omicron and cold-like symptoms rapidly taking over in London

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/omicron-and-cold-like-symptoms-rapidly-taking-over-in-london

Data up to 11th December 2021

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/omicron-and-cold-like-symptoms-rapidly-taking-over-in-london

In people with at least two doses in the UK

Currently 27,000 new daily symptomatic cases 

An increase of 6% from 25,411 new daily cases last week
 
London is currently seeing a rapid rise in positive cases

Driven by omicron

Prevalence in the UK

One in 57 currently have symptomatic COVID

ZOE‚Äôs predicted Long COVID incidence rate

1,418 people a day will go on to experience symptoms for longer than 12 weeks 

Omicron symptoms

Initial analysis of symptom data from positive cases in London

To compare Delta and Omicron symptoms

London data was selected from a week in October

With the most recent week ending 10th December

This initial analysis found no clear differences in the early symptoms (3 days after test) between Delta and Omicron. 

The top five symptoms reported in the ZOE app

runny nose

headache

fatigue (either mild or severe)

sneezing

sore throat

SA Patients presentations

Blocked or runny nose

Headache

Tiredness

Scratchy or sore throat

Body aches


NHS official symptoms

The main symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are:

a high temperature 

a new, continuous cough 

a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste

Professor Tim Spector

Omicron is set to be the dominant strain in the UK by Christmas, 

and in the New Year cases could hit a peak higher than anything we‚Äôve ever seen before. 

Hopefully people now recognise the cold-like symptoms which appear to be the predominant feature of Omicron. 

Ahead of Christmas, if people want to get together and keep vulnerable family members safe,

I‚Äôd recommend limiting social contact in the run up to Christmas,

and doing a few Lateral Flow Tests just before the big family gathering.

Chris Whitty

Omicron wave, going to peak very quickly 

Infections doubling every 2 to 3 days

NHS, reduction in supply and increase in demand
more records would be broken

Omicron as well as delta?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-59664383

Number of omicron infections is rising very fast

Delta cases are flat

and that Delta is not going away, but being built on

If doubling time is every 3 days

Christmas Eve, cases + 462,704 

Next few days, 2 million testing positive

Forced into 10 days isolation

Their contacts may also be symptomatic

Testing capacity exceeded

(Country currently averaging 790,000 PCR tests a day)

Professor Andrew Hayward (SAGE)

Outbreak spreading faster than tests can keep up

If you think about getting a year's worth of rain over a month, then you're going to get flooding and potentially severe flooding, no matter how much you've shored up your defences

Professor David Spiegelhalter (statistician)

Reduced socialisation will slow spread down

If it kept on this doubling every two days, you get to 11 million on Christmas Day,

and the entire country on New Year's Eve

Now, this is not sensible

Millions of people are going to catch this over the next few weeks and months

That we know that's going to happen

It could be considerably better than last winter, it could be worse

London in hospital data

Majority of cases in London are Omicron

South Africa now

Cases are rising steeply in all provinces

Cases in the 4th wave are higher than the peaks in all previous waves

Hospitalisations and deaths are not currently following this trend and,

are still relatively low 

Most admissions to hospitals are still for unvaccinated people

Pfizer Boosters have been approved and can be given 6 months after full vaccination

The first people will be eligible at the end of December

I'm living in South Africa. 

The masses of our population live in townships and are unvaccinated. 

There are no masks or any social distancing ever since the "pandemic" started. 

The Elephant üêò is in the room and is being ignored. 

We're only 25-30% fully vaccinated. 

16 seater minibus üöê taxis commute the masses of the people daily, no masks or social distancing. 

Hospitalizations and deaths are way lower than a year ago. 

Natural Immunity needs to come back to the discussion and needs to stop being downplayed or disregarded by the MSM.

World Health Organization

Omicron is spreading across the globe at an unprecedented rate

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-59656385

Dr Tedros 
Surely, we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril. 

Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems
