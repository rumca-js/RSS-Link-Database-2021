Omicron, similar cold type symptoms to delta in the first few days

Omicron cases have less anosmia

Fever is less common

Having 5 or more symptoms less common with omicron than delta

More breakthrough infections with delta, after 2 or 3 doses of vaccine

Common colds less transmissible than omicron just now

One in two chance common cold symptoms will test positive for covid

Therefore, test for colds

Avoid people who have a cold

Pings are now too slow to be effective

Omicron onset, 2 days rather than 5 for delta

Omicron will run its course faster, all over in 4 or 5 days

Infection risk after 8 days in negligible

IOM, back to work when symptoms resolve and 2 lateral flow tests

From 17,000 omicron cases
