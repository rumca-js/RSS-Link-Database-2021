Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! Today we have some very fun an interesting VR content for you guys. From Hologram/ holographic VR display research at Stanford, to HaptX glove projects, Apple VR leaks, Oculus updates, and most importantly, the likely cancellation of Decegear and Megadodo's hardware projects. 

I'm changing the title to see if this actually works. video was performing significantly worse than normal, I wanna see if really all I can cover is Quest stuff. 


I hope you enjoy this week of VR stuff.
