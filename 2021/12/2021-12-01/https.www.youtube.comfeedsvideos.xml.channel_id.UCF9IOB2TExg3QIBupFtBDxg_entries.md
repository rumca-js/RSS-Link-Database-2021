Cases seem mild so far

California Wednesday, 1st December

California from South Africa on 22nd November

Mild symptoms started 25th November

Mild symptoms that are improving

Not hospitalized

In isolation

Aggressive contact tracing is underway

Person fully vaccinated

Had received two doses Moderna within the six-month window

Close contacts have tested negative

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci

We have 60 million people in this country who are not vaccinated who are eligible to be vaccinated

Let’s get them vaccinated. 

Let’s get the people vaccinated, boosted. 

Let’s get the children vaccinated.

Get boosted now

We may not need a variant-specific boost.

(EU, vaccine rollout for five-to-11-year-olds 13th December)

Dissent from Mike Ryan

There is no evidence that I'm aware of 

that will suggest that boosting the entire population is going to necessarily provide any greater protection for otherwise healthy individuals

against hospitalization or death

WHO, coronavirus will keep producing new variants for as long as it is allowed to circulate freely in unvaccinated

Moderna, a material drop in efficacy

Pfizer applied to FDA to boost 16 and 17 year olds

Enough experimental vaccine to begin a clinical trial within about two months

Very high commercial scale, by early March

cautiously optimistic, especially for the boosted

Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa,

but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of a specific infection with omicron

Professor Salim Abdool Karim, South Africa

The vaccine should hold well in terms of preventing hospitalizations

The European Union

44 confirmed cases in EU countries

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/12/01/eu-must-consider-mandatory-vaccination-says-ursula-von-der-leyen/

Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission’s President

Must consider mandatory vaccination

highly contagious omicron variant

150 million not vaccinated

This is an enormous health cost coming along

77 % of adults

66% of whole population

Greece and Austria already mandating

Stringent response measures may be needed for omicron

highly likely that omicron, after infection or vaccination to some extent there will be immune escape  

Expects booster jabs to provide protection for now

Future remains highly uncertain 

potentially very significant wave of infections

WHO advice for international traffic in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529)

https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/who-advice-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-the-sars-cov-2-omicron-variant

Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant as compared to other VOCs

Current SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostics continue to be effective

Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread

People not fully vaccinated, sick or at increased risk,

should be advised to postpone travel to areas with community transmission
