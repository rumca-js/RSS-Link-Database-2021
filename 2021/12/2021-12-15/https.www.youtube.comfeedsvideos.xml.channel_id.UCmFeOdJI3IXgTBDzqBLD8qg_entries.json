Is money, investing in a business empire, and being a millionaire worth it for tearing up your family in the process and eroding your identity? Walter White highlights the Jungian idea of the shadow self and how the shadow's pursuit of money, wealth, business success, and more comes from the repression felt by the persona.\n\n00:00 - The Repressed Walt\n11:00 - BlockerX\n12:31 - The Shadow Self\n26:00 - The Wider Implications\n\n#BreakingBad #Moon", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljQmp2TMamc", "date_published": "2021-12-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
