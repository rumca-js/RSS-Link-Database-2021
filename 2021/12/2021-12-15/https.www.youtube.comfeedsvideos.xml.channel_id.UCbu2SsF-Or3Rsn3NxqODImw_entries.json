Since the release of the game\u2019s Endwalker expansion, long queues to even get into the game's servers have been a headache for both players and devs. In response to the long wait times, Square Enix released another announcement with what steps it's taking to address the congestion.\n\nDeVante also talks about New World\u2019s Winter Convergence Festival live from December 16 to January 11, 2022.

Watch any magician dazzle an audience with a sleight of hand, misdirection, or optical illusion and you'll see even the most stoic of people wearing an expression of astonishment. It's a unique kind of joy that is almost always followed by a desperate need to figure out the trick. \"How?\" onlookers will ask, trying to make sense of it.\n\nFor years now, developer Arkane Studios has been pulling off some of the most impressive magic tricks around. Through the Dishonored series and Prey, it has delivered worlds that are stunning and intricately designed, and that--most importantly--present the player with seemingly endless possibilities. This is all on top of stunning art direction, memorable characters, and compelling stories.\n\nArkane's games feel like impossible creations, each one a complex set of interlocking systems and mechanics that present a dynamic space where players are invited to poke and prod at their clockwork nature and watch as it reacts without falling apart. As an immersive sim and an action game, Deathloop is yet another impressive effort from Arkane in this respect. But what elevates it and makes it GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2021 is that it gives us all what we want most after being wowed by a magic trick: a peek behind the curtain.\n\n#DeathLoop\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:35 Game Of The Year Discussion\n16:16 Arkane Studios Awarding Interview", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jde-L5uFFdE", "date_published": "2021-12-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Games Not To Miss On Xbox Game Pass", "description": "The ever growing Xbox Game Pass library is a good problem to have, but it can be a little overwhelming.

Alan Wake II will, however, skew more towards traditional survival-horror, a twist on the original's more psychological horror focus.\n\nLater in the video, Persia talks about Halo content creator Mint Blitz who shows how a new speedrunning trick is done, in which he credits the discovery of the skip to members of the Haloruns speedrunning community. What's notable about the skip is that it doesn't seem all that difficult to accomplish and lets you jump from the Excavation Site to the second to last mission of the campaign.

In this video, we break down our time spent with Sloclap's press preview build.\n\nThe hands-on preview build we were given only features a small slice of what's to come when the full game releases in February, yet this is still more than enough to showcase the depth and potential brilliance of Sifu's hand-to-hand action. A back alley nightclub provides the setting for this single-level preview, its ambience shifting as you move between neon-lit social areas and dim backstage corridors. \n\nMuch like the martial arts movies that inspired it, Sifu often positions you as a lone fighter facing off against an overwhelming number of foes. This is the case in most games, of course, and at first glance, the setup for Sifu's brawls looks reminiscent of the Batman: Arkham games. The similarities basically end there, though. Sifu's combat is grounded in reality by comparison. You'll barely scrape by in most encounters, even when utilizing the full potential of your fighting skills, awareness of the environment, and ingenuity.\n\nSlocap says there will be story connotations related to your rapid aging and the price of vengeance, but this isn't present in the preview build. Instead, this snapshot of the game offers a brief glimpse of the intriguing elements wrapped around its rousing combat. My anticipation for Sifu was already high just based on its trailers, but after getting a taste I can't wait for more.
