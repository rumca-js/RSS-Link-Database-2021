In this episode of GameSpot News, FFXIV Sales are suspended due to server congestion, New World’s Winter Convergence Event goes live and a free access weekend starts for Call of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer. 

In this video, DeVante talks about how Square Enix will temporarily suspend the sales of both Final Fantasy 14's base game and the complete edition. Since the release of the game’s Endwalker expansion, long queues to even get into the game's servers have been a headache for both players and devs. In response to the long wait times, Square Enix released another announcement with what steps it's taking to address the congestion.

DeVante also talks about New World’s Winter Convergence Festival live from December 16 to January 11, 2022. Players can earn Winter Tokens from repeatable quests across Aeternum to earn exclusive new armor, weapons, and more, as they look to stop the evil Winter Warrior from plunging the land into the dreaded Forever Winter.

Lucy and Tamoor talk about why Arkane's latest game, Deathloop, deserves to be the GameSpot's Game of the Year 2021.  The duo discusses how the studio took the best of open-ended action, immersive sims, and rogue-lites to present something that distinct and exceptional.

A good magic trick makes the impossible seem possible and inspires a child-like sense of wonder. Watch any magician dazzle an audience with a sleight of hand, misdirection, or optical illusion and you'll see even the most stoic of people wearing an expression of astonishment. It's a unique kind of joy that is almost always followed by a desperate need to figure out the trick. "How?" onlookers will ask, trying to make sense of it.

For years now, developer Arkane Studios has been pulling off some of the most impressive magic tricks around. Through the Dishonored series and Prey, it has delivered worlds that are stunning and intricately designed, and that--most importantly--present the player with seemingly endless possibilities. This is all on top of stunning art direction, memorable characters, and compelling stories.

Arkane's games feel like impossible creations, each one a complex set of interlocking systems and mechanics that present a dynamic space where players are invited to poke and prod at their clockwork nature and watch as it reacts without falling apart. As an immersive sim and an action game, Deathloop is yet another impressive effort from Arkane in this respect. But what elevates it and makes it GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2021 is that it gives us all what we want most after being wowed by a magic trick: a peek behind the curtain.

## Alan Wake 2 Devs Calm Gameplay Fears | GameSpot News

In today’s GameSpot News, Persia talks about the Alan Wake II devs calming some gameplay fears, Halo Infinite speedrunners are already breaking the game, and more.

Remedy boss Sam Lake confirmed on Twitter that the sequel will still be a third-person game, amid questions about whether the series might make a change akin to Resident Evil 7 and Village and their first-person perspective. Alan Wake II will, however, skew more towards traditional survival-horror, a twist on the original's more psychological horror focus.

Later in the video, Persia talks about Halo content creator Mint Blitz who shows how a new speedrunning trick is done, in which he credits the discovery of the skip to members of the Haloruns speedrunning community. What's notable about the skip is that it doesn't seem all that difficult to accomplish and lets you jump from the Excavation Site to the second to last mission of the campaign. Link to the full video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ8g9XkutRY 

Lastly, Persia goes over the new games that come to Xbox Game Pass for December. These games include Mortal Kombat 11, The Gunk, Broken Age, and more starting December 16th. Game Pass users will also be able to play DLC and game updates for Ark: Survival Evolved, Minecraft Dungeons, and The Elder Scrolls Online.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is getting a whole second year of post-launch content, kicking off with the Crossover Stories DLC that see Odyssey's Kassandra and Valhalla's Eivor meet. But the first major expansion for Year 2 is Dawn of Ragnarok, in which Eivor witnesses Havi's adventures during the earliest days of one of the most well-known moments of Norse myth.

Dawn of Ragnarok takes place after the events of the Asgard and Jotunheim Sagas, so if you haven't gotten that far in Assassin's Creed Valhalla and don't want to be spoiled, this is your final warning to pause this video and come back later. Don't worry, we'll still be here.

In the following video, we go over everything that we learned about Dawn of Ragnarok during a preview event.

Dawn of Ragnarok is scheduled to release as paid DLC on March 10.

## Sifu Preview - Growing Stronger With Death

Sifu blends together all the best parts of martial arts, frenetic action, and a challenging set of opponents. In this video, we break down our time spent with Sloclap's press preview build.

The hands-on preview build we were given only features a small slice of what's to come when the full game releases in February, yet this is still more than enough to showcase the depth and potential brilliance of Sifu's hand-to-hand action. A back alley nightclub provides the setting for this single-level preview, its ambience shifting as you move between neon-lit social areas and dim backstage corridors. 

Much like the martial arts movies that inspired it, Sifu often positions you as a lone fighter facing off against an overwhelming number of foes. This is the case in most games, of course, and at first glance, the setup for Sifu's brawls looks reminiscent of the Batman: Arkham games. The similarities basically end there, though. Sifu's combat is grounded in reality by comparison. You'll barely scrape by in most encounters, even when utilizing the full potential of your fighting skills, awareness of the environment, and ingenuity.

Slocap says there will be story connotations related to your rapid aging and the price of vengeance, but this isn't present in the preview build. Instead, this snapshot of the game offers a brief glimpse of the intriguing elements wrapped around its rousing combat. My anticipation for Sifu was already high just based on its trailers, but after getting a taste I can't wait for more. Sifu releases on February 22, 2022 for PS4, PS5, and PC.
