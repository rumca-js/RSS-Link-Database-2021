The film is based on a novel of the same name that was published in 1929, and the story looks at the theme of African Americans who are light skinned enough that they could pass as white, told through the story of two childhood friends who reunite as adults, when one of the friends is indeed passing.\n\n\"It's such an intimate examination of race,\" Mary says. \"It is so fascinating. It is so thoughtful. I can't recommend it enough.\"\n\nLISTEN TO LOOCH PLAYLIST:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYClJc3TpV5J_sXyCfes-p6vCgOpCmleh\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#passingfilm", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuqJWOrfYXI", "date_published": "2021-12-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
