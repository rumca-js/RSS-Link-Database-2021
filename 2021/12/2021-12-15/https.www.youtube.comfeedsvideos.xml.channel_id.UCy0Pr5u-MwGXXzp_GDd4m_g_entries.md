That's right, earlier this summer I auditioned for SNL! And while I did NOT book the job, I still worked really hard on my tape and so I wanted to share it with you all. For the audition you get roughly 5 minutes to showcase as many characters, impressions, accents and talents you can do. I also sent a writing package that includes 5 original sketches... all before a 2 week deadline. This was my first time ever auditioning for the show. I learned a lot and I hope I get another shot next year!
