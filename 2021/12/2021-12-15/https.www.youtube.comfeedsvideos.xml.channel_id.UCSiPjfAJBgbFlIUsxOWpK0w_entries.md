If you don’t know the band @lawrencetheband, you must go listen to them NOW. I’m just so glad that we were able to do something together while they were on the West Coast. And to get to do this CLASSIC PAUL SIMON song too. It was…heaven. But like a surprisingly difficult heaven, where you wish you’d been able to rehearse your part more but whatever it’s fine.

LYRICS
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard

Well, Mama pajama rolled outta bed
And she ran to the police station
And when the Papa found out, and began to shout
He started the investigation

It's against the law, it was against the law
What that Mama saw, oh it was against the law

The Mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The Papa said "Oy! if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"

Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way, I'm taking my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye Rosie, the queen of Corona
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard

In a couple of days, they're gonna take me away
But the press let the story leak
When the radical priest come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek

Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way, I'm taking my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye Rosie, the queen of Corona
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard

Oh oh, down by the schoolyard
Down by the schoolyard
Down by the schoolyard
