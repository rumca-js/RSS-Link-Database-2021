I will never be able to look at bananas the same way again. The history behind this fruit is filled with government coups, propaganda, and predatory corporations.
This is the story of how US imperialism gave us crappy bananas - and why the ones in your kitchen might be doomed.

Big thanks to Mark Whalen for his research on the topic.
