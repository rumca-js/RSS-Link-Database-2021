In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about reports of Call of Duty Warzone coming to mobile in 2022, how Halo Infinite once had a Zelda-Like open world and GTA Online adding story DLC featuring Dr. Dre. 

In this video, DeVante talks about reports that Call of Duty Warzone is coming to mobile devices in 2022. Currently, Call of Duty Mobile has a battle royale mode available within it, but the game is a broader slice of multiplayer influenced by the mainline series.

DeVante also talks about how Halo Infinite’s campaign had a Breath of the Wild like open-world before 343 Industries cut two thirds. The cut was a result of the team running into development issues due to its development suite known as Faber, which was old and challenging to use.

Later in the video, DeVante goes over GTA Online’s adding story DLC featuring GTA 5’s Franklin and hip hop legend Dr. Dre. The expansion is called "The Contract," and it releases on December 15.

In today’s GameSpot News, Persia talks about a major Halo Infinite campaign bug that could make you lose your cosmetics, a new Halo trademark that has been filed, and more. 

343 Industries has advised players to not use the Xbox Quick Resume feature for Halo Infinite's campaign because doing so could cause players to lose multiplayer content. Unfortunately, when players are offline or become disconnected from the network, the cosmetics will not appear in multiplayer. Using Quick Resume is known to boot players from the network, which is also affecting the multiplayer mode, prompting players to have to close the game entirely and reboot each time.

Later in the video, Persia talks about Microsoft filing a trademark for "Halo: The Endless", as well as "The Endless", with few details to help determine what it might be referring to. Halo Infinite has been described by Microsoft as its platform for Halo for the foreseeable future, so it's not out of the question to assume this might be the name of the first planned content expansion for the game or maybe an entirely new media venture such as the Halo TV series coming to Paramount+.

Lastly, Persia talks about Halo Infinite winning the Player’s Voice Award at the Game Awards which will officially be going live tonight, December 9th at 4:30 PM PT.

Tune in to THE GAME AWARDS 2021, video game's biggest night live on Thursday, December 9! Join us from Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles for awards, world premieres, and musical performances from Sting, Imagine Dragons and The Game Awards Orchestra. Geoff Keighley hosts a spectacular showcase with special guests and appearances to be announced. 

Last year's Game Awards livestream featured big announcements across all the major studios including Nintendo, Playstation, and Xbox. This year's Game Awards Livestream is sure to be as big or even bigger with trailers and world premieres throughout the event. 

The Game Awards and Keighley himself have been teasing what's to come at this year's event via their social media accounts. Presenters confirmed for the event so far include Shang-Chi star Simu Liu, former Nintendo president Reggie Fils-Aime, and Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss from the upcoming Matrix: Resurrections. Musicians confirmed for live performances include Imagine Dragons and music legend Sting, the latter performing "What Could Have Been" from the Netflix series Arcane: A League Of Legends Story. We'll also see the return of The Game Awards orchestra led by famous composer Lorne Balfe.

Game Award winners will be announced from over 30 categories across general gaming and esports including Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, Esports Team of the Year, and Esports Player of the Year. The event will also feature announcements involving "40 to 50 games" according to an Epic Games interview with Keighley, with the number of brand-new titles announced being "probably in the double digits." Keighley says there will be four or five game announcements on the same scale as Elden Ring.

## Battlefield 2042 Battle Royale On The Way? | GameSpot News

In today’s GameSpot News, Persia goes over reports of a battle royale mode that might be coming to Battlefield 2042 soon, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla getting a possible god-of-war styled expansion and more.

A battle royale mode for Battlefield 2042 is said to be arriving "in the very near future” according to longtime games journalist, Tom Henderson. Although it is on the way, no official dates were announced but it’s said that it won't surface "in the next six months."

There were also reports of the next game in the Battlefield franchise to be even more like an Overwatch-Styled shooter and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla getting another story expansion. However, this new expansion could be the biggest yet with 40 hours of additional content.

Later in the video, Persia goes over Ubisoft Quartz - Ubisoft’s first dive into the NFT market. Quartz will wrap up in-game cosmetics into their own NFT's, each of which will have a unique serial number and history of owners. The Quartz Beta is only currently supported by Ghost Recon: Breakpoint on PC, and is only available in certain regions despite using a decentralized blockchain called Tezos which leads Ubisoft to call its venture "energy-efficient". In case you didn’t know, it can cost an extreme amount of energy to produce an NFT and comes with a major cost to the environment which may be why Ubisoft is stressing the energy-efficient angle of Tezos.

Lastly, Persia goes over the most recent teaser for the Halo TV show that is set to launch on Paramount+ in 2022.
