In the original, the chorus always felt like a different song from the verse. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the original! But I wanted the verse to feel a little more like the same song in this rendition. So we made it a little more peppy. Peppy\u2026that\u2019s the word.\n\nSave this song on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/2r3Yqkh\nFollow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/pomplamoosemusic\nBecome a patron of our music (to vote on the songs we cover and get merch and stuff like that): http://www.patreon.com/pomplamoose\n\nA cover of The Police's \"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic\" by Pomplamoose.\n\nMUSICIAN CREDITS\nLead Vocals: Nataly Dawn\nKeys: Jack Conte\nGuitar: John Schroeder\nBass: Joe Ayoub\nDrums: Ben Rose\nBackground Vocals: Sarah Dugas\n\nAUDIO CREDITS\nEngineer: Tim Sonnefeld\nAssistant Engineer: Tyler Karmen\nMixing/Mastering: Caleb Parker\nProducer: Ben Rose\n\nVIDEO CREDITS\nDirector: Dom Fera\nDP: Merlin Showalter\nCamera Operators: Ryan Blewett, Dijon Herron\nGaffer: Arjay Ancheta\nLighting Tech: Brandon Garman\nProduction Designer: Shannon McDonough\nHair & Makeup: Amanda Bourne\nEditor/Colorist: Dominic Mercurio\n\nRecorded at 64 Sound in Los Angeles.\n\nLYRICS\nThough I've tried before to tell her\nOf the feelings I have for her in my heart\nEvery time that I come near her\nI just lose my nerve as I've done from the start\n\nEvery little thing she does is magic\nEverything she do just turns me on\nEven though my life before was tragic\nNow I know my love for her goes on\n\nDo I have to tell the story\nOf a thousand rainy days since we first met\nIt's a big enough umbrella\nBut it's always me\nThat ends up getting wet\n\nEvery little thing she does is magic\nEverything she do just turns me on\nEven though my life before was tragic\nNow I know my love for her goes on\n\nI resolved to call her up\nA thousand times a day\nAnd ask her if she'll marry me\nIn some old fashioned way\nBut my silent fears have gripped me\nLong before I reach the phone\nLong before my tongue has tripped me\nMust I always be alone?\n\nEvery little thing she does is magic\nEverything she do just turns me on\nEven though my life before was tragic\nNow I know my love for her goes on", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC6fIq15r18", "date_published": "2021-12-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
