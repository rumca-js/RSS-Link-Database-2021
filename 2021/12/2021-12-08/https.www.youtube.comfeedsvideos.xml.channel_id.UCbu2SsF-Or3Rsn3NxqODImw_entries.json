Currently, Call of Duty Mobile has a battle royale mode available within it, but the game is a broader slice of multiplayer influenced by the mainline series.\n\nDeVante also talks about how Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign had a Breath of the Wild like open-world before 343 Industries cut two thirds. The cut was a result of the team running into development issues due to its development suite known as Faber, which was old and challenging to use.\n\nLater in the video, DeVante goes over GTA Online\u2019s adding story DLC featuring GTA 5\u2019s Franklin and hip hop legend Dr. Dre. The expansion is called \"The Contract,\" and it releases on December 15.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNs0-zqQAFA", "date_published": "2021-12-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PSA: Don't Use Xbox Quick Resume With Halo Infinite Right Now | GameSpot News", "description": "In today\u2019s GameSpot News, Persia talks about a major Halo Infinite campaign bug that could make you lose your cosmetics, a new Halo trademark that has been filed, and more. \n\n343 Industries has advised players to not use the Xbox Quick Resume feature for Halo Infinite's campaign because doing so could cause players to lose multiplayer content. Unfortunately, when players are offline or become disconnected from the network, the cosmetics will not appear in multiplayer. Using Quick Resume is known to boot players from the network, which is also affecting the multiplayer mode, prompting players to have to close the game entirely and reboot each time.\n\nLater in the video, Persia talks about Microsoft filing a trademark for \"Halo: The Endless\", as well as \"The Endless\", with few details to help determine what it might be referring to. Halo Infinite has been described by Microsoft as its platform for Halo for the foreseeable future, so it's not out of the question to assume this might be the name of the first planned content expansion for the game or maybe an entirely new media venture such as the Halo TV series coming to Paramount+.\n\nLastly, Persia talks about Halo Infinite winning the Player\u2019s Voice Award at the Game Awards which will officially be going live tonight, December 9th at 4:30 PM PT.\n\nFor more information on all of our topics, please visit gamespot.com.\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro - 00:00\nHalo Quick Resume Bug - 00:07\nHalo: The Endless Trademark - 00:56\nHalo Infinite Player's Voice Award - 02:08\nThe Game Awards & Outro - 02:41", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzbgDs0__AU", "date_published": "2021-12-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "THE GAME AWARDS 2021 Livestream", "description": "Tune in to THE GAME AWARDS 2021, video game's biggest night live on Thursday, December 9!

Although it is on the way, no official dates were announced but it\u2019s said that it won't surface \"in the next six months.\"\n\nThere were also reports of the next game in the Battlefield franchise to be even more like an Overwatch-Styled shooter and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla getting another story expansion. However, this new expansion could be the biggest yet with 40 hours of additional content.\n\nLater in the video, Persia goes over Ubisoft Quartz - Ubisoft\u2019s first dive into the NFT market. Quartz will wrap up in-game cosmetics into their own NFT's, each of which will have a unique serial number and history of owners. The Quartz Beta is only currently supported by Ghost Recon: Breakpoint on PC, and is only available in certain regions despite using a decentralized blockchain called Tezos which leads Ubisoft to call its venture \"energy-efficient\". In case you didn\u2019t know, it can cost an extreme amount of energy to produce an NFT and comes with a major cost to the environment which may be why Ubisoft is stressing the energy-efficient angle of Tezos.\n\nLastly, Persia goes over the most recent teaser for the Halo TV show that is set to launch on Paramount+ in 2022.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgqcCYob9W8", "date_published": "2021-12-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Warzone New Pacific Map Livestream", "description": "Verdansk is gone and Caldera is here!
