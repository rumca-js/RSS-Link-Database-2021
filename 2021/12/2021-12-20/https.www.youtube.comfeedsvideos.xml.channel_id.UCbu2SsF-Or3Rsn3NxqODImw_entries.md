Love it or loathe it, there’s no denying that Five Nights at Freddy’s, or FNaF, is a global sensation.  But how did this horror game about creepy animatronic animals get so many sequels, books, fan theories, and even a movie? This is the History of Five Nights At Freddy’s.

Five Nights at Freddy's started life as a terrifying indie game made by a one-man development team and exploded in popularity when its jumpscares and creepy animatronics became perfect YouTube let's play fodder. Over time, FNaF has become a colossal franchise, with multiple sequels, spin-offs, books, and even a movie. 

In the above video, we chronicle the history of the mainline FNaF games, starting with Chipper & Sons Lumber Co, an indie game that got ripped apart by critics but eventually led to creator Scott Cawthon making something even scarier.  Cawthon's new project was Five Nights at Freddy's, a relatively straightforward horror game where you play as a nighttime security guard at a Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria, a family-friendly pizza spot haunted by broken and dangerous animatronics. Thanks to its cheap price point, dark lore, and scares, it skyrocketed in popularity, and Cawthon released many sequels in quick succession. This is the story of the entire franchise, from inception to what it is today.

The latest entry, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach launched for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. For more, be sure to subscribe at youtube.com/gamespot.

In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about why Cyberpunk 2077 has no police chases, a working metro system added to 2077 via mods, how the Xbox is affecting the Halo tournament as well as the next Mass Effect allegedly running on Unreal Engine 5. 

In this video, DeVante talks about Cyberpunk 2077’s quest director revealing why the game is missing a police chase system outside of scripted sequences. Cyberpunk also gets a new mod that adds a working metro system. This mod by KeanuWheeze features 19 working stations and full integration with the game’s UI and controls and players can switch between first and third person views. 

DeVante also talks about the Xbox shortage’s affect on the Halo Infinite tournament. According to 343’s eSports lead, Tashi, revealed some competitors were using "development" consoles due to the ongoing semiconductor shortages.

Later in the video, It appears the next Mass Effect game will, as rumored, run on Epic's Unreal Engine. BioWare producer Brenon Holmes recently tweeted about an open position at the company for associate technical director, and the ideal candidate will have experience with Unreal Engine 4 and 5.
