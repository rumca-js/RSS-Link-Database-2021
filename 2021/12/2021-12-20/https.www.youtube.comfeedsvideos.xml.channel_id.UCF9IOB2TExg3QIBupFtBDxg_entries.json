This will prevent cases of inadvertent intravascular administration of vaccine.\n\nHere is some discussion to suggest inadvertent intravascular vaccine administration is a variable in the aetiology of complications after adenoviral vector vaccine administration and after mRNA vaccines.\n\nThese adverse events, although rare have reduced public confidence in covid vaccination, especially amongst the young, where vaccine rates are lowest.\n\nIt has long been known that intravenous injection of adenovirus leads to TTS in mice\n\nhttps://ashpublications.org/blood/article/109/7/2832/125650/Adenovirus-induced-thrombocytopenia-the-role-of\n\nNow, new covid vaccine specific work agrees with this previous work\n\nThrombocytopenia and splenic platelet directed immune responses after intravenous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration (29th June 2021)\n\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.29.450356v1\n\nThe authors conclude, \u2018Our work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS.\u2019 \n\n\u2018We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Hence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.\u2019\n\n\nAlso after giving mRNA vaccines\n\nA new study finds that giving mice intravenous mRNA vaccine also causes heart inflammation in mice. \n\nIntravenous Injection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccine Can Induce Acute Myopericarditis in Mouse Model (August 2021)\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab707/6353927\n\n\u2018Our study indicates that IV injection of vaccines might partially contribute to this clinical phenotype, thus warranting a reconsideration of the practice of IM injection without aspiration, which carries the risk of inadvertent IV injection.\u2019 \n\nAgreement from \u2018fact check\u2019 from Leo Nicolai, Cardiology Fellow, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich:\n\n(German Centre for Cardiovascular Research)\n\nhttps://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/incorrect-vaccine-administration-is-a-potential-cause-of-post-vaccine-adverse-effects-but-more-research-is-still-needed-to-confirm-or-reject-this-hypothesis/?fbclid=IwAR0nBbM6v0V2WPFn4LxIdfR4FNAvIzLGKhzFPdQPG8mu_FR1InB8OzYQgMc\n\n\u2018Indeed, there is peer-reviewed work showing in mice that possibly intravenous injection of mRNA vaccine leads to myocardial inflammation.\u2019\n\n\u2018that intravenous injection of adenoviral vector based vaccine (AZ1222, ChAdOx1) leads to thrombocytopenia and platelet-directed immune responses, offering a possible explanation for vaccine-induced thrombosis/thrombocytopenia\u2019\n\n\u2018these data might indicate a simple measure to lower the incidence of vaccine-induced side effects,\u2019\n\n\u2018There is a lack of data on frequency and effects of IV injection in humans.\u2019\n\n\nDenmark has changed their national guidelines\n\nhttps://en.ssi.dk/news/epi-news/2021/no-19-21---2021\n\nBased on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before
