Check out Dr.Cohen's channel, Whats Up Doc, https://www.youtube.com/@whatsupdoc.

In this interview I put a series of hard questions to Dr. Cohen, you will find his answers revealing and thought provoking.

Do you feel it is important in medicine for the individual patient to be empowered or should professionals retain control?

Is it important that patients understand their health and how to promote health, or should we just rely on doctors to heal us when we get sick?

Is there a risk of promoting ‘medical dependency’?

Is there a difference between compliance and concordance?

Do people need a level of knowledge and understanding in order to make informed decisions about their health?

Is there a risk for medicine to medicalise?

Can some diseases be prevented? If so how?

Can some diseases be reversed? If so how?

We all seem fairly well fed in Western countries, even a lot of obesity, presumably nutritional deficiencies are not a problem?

Please pass this video on, Basically, we need to change the vaccine administration guidelines to include precautionary aspiration, prior to pushing in the vaccine. This will prevent cases of inadvertent intravascular administration of vaccine.

Here is some discussion to suggest inadvertent intravascular vaccine administration is a variable in the aetiology of complications after adenoviral vector vaccine administration and after mRNA vaccines.

These adverse events, although rare have reduced public confidence in covid vaccination, especially amongst the young, where vaccine rates are lowest.

It has long been known that intravenous injection of adenovirus leads to TTS in mice

https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/109/7/2832/125650/Adenovirus-induced-thrombocytopenia-the-role-of

Now, new covid vaccine specific work agrees with this previous work

Thrombocytopenia and splenic platelet directed immune responses after intravenous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration (29th June 2021)

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.29.450356v1

The authors conclude, ‘Our work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS.’ 

‘We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation.’ 

‘Hence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.’


Also after giving mRNA vaccines

A new study finds that giving mice intravenous mRNA vaccine also causes heart inflammation in mice. 

Intravenous Injection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccine Can Induce Acute Myopericarditis in Mouse Model (August 2021)

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab707/6353927

‘Our study indicates that IV injection of vaccines might partially contribute to this clinical phenotype, thus warranting a reconsideration of the practice of IM injection without aspiration, which carries the risk of inadvertent IV injection.’ 

Agreement from ‘fact check’ from Leo Nicolai, Cardiology Fellow, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich:

(German Centre for Cardiovascular Research)

https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/incorrect-vaccine-administration-is-a-potential-cause-of-post-vaccine-adverse-effects-but-more-research-is-still-needed-to-confirm-or-reject-this-hypothesis/?fbclid=IwAR0nBbM6v0V2WPFn4LxIdfR4FNAvIzLGKhzFPdQPG8mu_FR1InB8OzYQgMc

‘Indeed, there is peer-reviewed work showing in mice that possibly intravenous injection of mRNA vaccine leads to myocardial inflammation.’

‘that intravenous injection of adenoviral vector based vaccine (AZ1222, ChAdOx1) leads to thrombocytopenia and platelet-directed immune responses, offering a possible explanation for vaccine-induced thrombosis/thrombocytopenia’

‘these data might indicate a simple measure to lower the incidence of vaccine-induced side effects,’

‘There is a lack of data on frequency and effects of IV injection in humans.’


Denmark has changed their national guidelines

https://en.ssi.dk/news/epi-news/2021/no-19-21---2021

Based on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before injection.

Omicron variant, doubling every two to three days

At least 45% of Methodist’s COVID-19 patients were omicron as of Friday

Wednesday, 32% COVID-19 tests on symptomatic patients

Saturday, (4 days before) 13%

Half of the hospital’s omicron patients have been vaccinated with either two or three doses

Four times as many positive COVID-19 test results since last week

Fueled by the continued spread of the omicron variant

Dr. Marc Boom, Methodist president and CEO

If this spreads so rapidly that there are massive numbers of infected people, 

even if on average they’re very mild, if that hits the vulnerable in our population and they end up hospitalized, that can still be an incredibly challenging time

S. Wesley Long, medical director of diagnostic microbiology

Very likely reach 100% of all COVID-19 cases within the hospital by January

That would be a faster sweep than even the delta variant, which took about a three-month span to sweep prior variants and achieve 100%,

It is also possible that delta remains in some equilibrium with omicron over time

Dr. Anthony Fauci

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fauci-warns-omicron-variant-raging-world-rcna9293

raging around the world

Omicron variant is really something to be reckoned with

Our hospitals, if things look like they're looking now, in the next week or two are going to be very stressed

because, again, we have so many people in this country who are eligible to be vaccinated who have not yet been vaccinated

The hospitalization to case ratio appears to be smaller than delta

We are going to see breakthrough infections, there's no doubt about that

The difference between a vaccinated and boosted person who has an infection and someone who has an infection who's never been vaccinated, 

there's a major difference with regard to the risk of severity
