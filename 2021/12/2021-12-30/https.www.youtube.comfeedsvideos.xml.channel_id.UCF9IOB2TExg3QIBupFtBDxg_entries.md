I'm hoping the pandemic will be essentially over in a few weeks and move into an endemic phase. The question is of course, how will the next month pan out?

New science explains South Africa's low rates of omicron severe disease

SARS-CoV-2 spike T cell responses induced upon vaccination or infection remain robust against Omicron

SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has multiple Spike (S) protein mutations

These contribute to escape from the neutralizing antibody responses, 
reducing vaccine protection from infection

We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike
In participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S (J and J) (n = 20)

or BNT162b2 (Pfizer) (n = 15

or in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 15)

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells play a key role in modulating COVID-19 severity and provide protective immunity

Results

70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups

The magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants

These results demonstrate that,
despite Omicron’s extensive mutations

and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, 

the majority of T cell response, 

induced by vaccination or natural infection, cross- recognises the variant.
 
Well-preserved T cell immunity to Omicron,

is likely to contribute to protection from severe COVID-19, 

supporting early clinical observations from South Africa. 

Further explanation

The limited effect of Omicron’s mutations on the T cell response suggests that vaccination or prior infection may still provide substantial protection from severe disease. 

Indeed, South Africa has reported a lower risk of hospitalisation and severe disease compared to the previous Delta wave
 
Cross-reactive T cell responses acquired through vaccination or infection may contribute to these apparent milder outcomes for Omicron.
 
The resilience of the T cell response demonstrated here also bodes well in the event that more highly mutated variants emerge in the future.
