disease\n\nSARS-CoV-2 spike T cell responses induced upon vaccination or infection remain robust against Omicron\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.26.21268380v1\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.27.21268278v1\n\nInstitute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town \n\nSARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has multiple Spike (S) protein mutations\n\nThese contribute to escape from the neutralizing antibody responses, \nreducing vaccine protection from infection\n\nWe assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike\nIn participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S (J and J) (n = 20)\n\nor BNT162b2 (Pfizer) (n = 15\n\nor in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 15)\n\nSARS-CoV-2-specific T cells play a key role in modulating COVID-19 severity and provide protective immunity\n\nResults\n\n70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups\n\nThe magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants\n\nThese results demonstrate that,\ndespite Omicron\u2019s extensive mutations\n\nand reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, \n\nthe majority of T cell response, \n\ninduced by vaccination or natural infection, cross- recognises the variant.\n \nWell-preserved T cell immunity to Omicron,\n\nis likely to contribute to protection from severe COVID-19, \n\nsupporting early clinical observations from South Africa. \n\nFurther explanation\n\nThe limited effect of Omicron\u2019s mutations on the T cell response suggests that vaccination or prior infection may still provide substantial protection from severe disease. \n\nIndeed, South Africa has reported a lower risk of hospitalisation and severe disease compared to the previous Delta wave\n \nCross-reactive T cell responses acquired through vaccination or infection may contribute to these apparent milder outcomes for Omicron.\n \nThe resilience of the T cell response demonstrated here also bodes well in the event that more highly mutated variants emerge in the future.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EDBJBmlvXY", "date_published": "2021-12-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
