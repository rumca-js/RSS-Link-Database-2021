<p>Photographer <a href="http://www.katherineannerose.com/">Katherine Anne Rose</a> found her Glasgow studio filling up with rolls of coloured backdrops. She began layering the coloured backgrounds pinned up on her studio walls, cutting them into grid formations, snipping and layering. “What I do with this paper doesn’t really have a name,” she says. “It’s not origami and I struggle to even say what these are… so I call them ‘paper works’.”</p><p>Bridget Riley is a huge source of knowledge and inspiration for Rose’s art, as well as Islamic geometric design. “It’s a long, slow process, which is meditative,” she says. “I find making them very peaceful and I hope this is reflected in the pieces themselves.”</p><p>See more at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/paper.work/?hl=en">instagram.com/paper.work</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2021/dec/18/a-photographers-backdrops-move-to-the-foreground-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p><i>This is the final episode of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/red-summers">Red Summers</a>, a 360 video series by artist Bayeté Ross Smith covering the untold American history of racial terrorism.&nbsp;</i></p><p>After the first world war, Black laborers moved to northern towns like East St Louis, Illinois, trying to escape Jim Crow in the south. In 1917, members of the White American Federation of Labor went on strike – and the company responded by hiring Black workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Angry white workers began attacking Black people in the city. Eventually this leads to white mobs firebombing houses with Black families inside, while others outside waited to shoot and kill them. Historians estimate between 39 and 150 Black people were killed in the East St Louis riots.</p><p>Just months later, another race riot in Houston broke out after member of the all-white Houston police department arrested a high-ranking soldier in an all-Black army regiment – a group that had recently returned from war. Only the Black soldiers were penalized</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2021/dec/18/how-white-mobs-firebombed-homes-and-decimated-a-black-community-in-illinois-video">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After failure of green homes grant scheme, campaigners want future projects to be long-term and accountable</p><p>Richard Derrington was one of the first people to apply for a much-hyped government grant to decarbonise his home, a cottage in the Cotswolds, and help the UK meet its aim to be net zero by 2050.</p><p>His speed off the mark counted for little as he faced months of delays, bureaucracy and repeated requests to prove his identity. A year on from applying for the £5,000 green homes grant, Derrington finally had the satisfaction of seeing a new heat pump installed in his garden.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/18/goalposts-must-stop-moving-plea-for-stability-in-uks-green-homes-drive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Peatland vital carbon store but campaigners say lack of immediate action makes plan a ‘damp squib’</p><p>The sale of peat to gardeners in England and Wales is to be banned by 2024 under plans published by the government on Saturday. Ministers said they also aimed to end peat use in the professional horticulture sector by 2028.</p><p>The government set a voluntary target in 2011 for compost retailers to end sales of peat by 2020. But peat use fell by only 25% from 2011-2019 and increased by 9% in 2020 as Covid lockdowns boosted gardening as a hobby.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/18/peat-sales-to-gardeners-in-england-and-wales-to-be-banned-by-2024">Continue reading...</a>
