Viral replication is reduced in the lung tissue, but increased in the bronchi. This could indicate increased transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity.

HKUMed finds Omicron SARS-CoV-2
can infect faster and better than Delta 
in human bronchus

https://researchnews.cc/news/10606/HKUMed-finds-Omicron-SARS-CoV-2-can-infect-faster-and-better-than-Delta-in-human-bronchus#.Yb8Nai-l2QV

First information on how Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infect human respiratory tract. 

Omicron infects and multiplies 70 times faster than the Delta in human bronchus, 

which may explain why Omicron may transmit faster

Omicron infection in the lung is significantly lower than the original SARS-CoV-2, 

which may be an indicator of lower disease severity. 

This research is currently under peer review for publication. 

Pioneered the use of ex vivo cultures of the respiratory tract,

for investigating many emerging virus infections since 2007

Lung tissue removed for treatment of the lung

Dr Chan and his team successfully isolated the Omicron SARS-CoV-2,

and used this experimental to compare infection with the original and Delta variants

24 hours after infection

Omicron variant replicated around 70 times higher than the Delta variant and the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. 

In contrast, the Omicron variant replicated less efficiently (more than 10 times lower) in the human lung tissue than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, 

which may suggest lower severity of disease.
 
Dr Chan

It is important to note that the severity of disease in humans is not determined only by virus replication but also by the host immune response to the infection,

which may lead to dysregulation of the innate immune system, i.e. “cytokine storm”

It is also noted that, by infecting many more people, 

a very infectious virus may cause more severe disease and death even though the virus itself may be less pathogenic. 

Therefore, taken together with our recent studies showing that the Omicron variant can partially escape immunity from vaccines and past infection, 

the overall threat from Omicron variant is likely to be very significant.

Koch's postulates 
The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease but should not be found in healthy organisms.

The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.

The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.

The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

Thanks to Rebecca at DW News. Omicron cases will rise in Europe over the next few weeks. This will mean tens of millions of people will have the infection all at the same time. However, South Africa has had this variant for a month, and hospital admissions remain low.

Thanks to Eddie and DW news. Omicron is coming so we need to get our immune system into the best possible condition.

Thanks to Marianna and DW. This would have been a better answer to the question I messed up:
Two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination provides some protection against symptomatic infection with omicron, but significant protection against hospitalisation (South Africa data)

33% protection against infection with omicron, relative to the unvaccinated

(down from 80% protection against infection with delta)

70% protection against hospital admission in omicron infection, relative to the unvaccinated

(down from 93% protection with delta)

the medical people I interact with at the hospital are far more optimistic than I've seen them since this all began in April last year

https://www.nicd.ac.za/diseases-a-z-index/disease-index-covid-19/surveillance-reports/daily-hospital-surveillance-datcov-report/

Nobody want's to tempt fate or speak to loudly just yet ,,,its like walking on egg shells at the moment – 

But there are open beds and they're not filling up just yet  - in fact there are 2 more beds now than last weekend.

Kind regards,

When you have a larger number of people getting infected, the total amount of hospitalizations is going to be more. That's just simple math 





Omicron and cold-like symptoms rapidly taking over in London

Data up to 11th December 2021

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/omicron-and-cold-like-symptoms-rapidly-taking-over-in-london

In people with at least two doses in the UK

Currently 27,000 new daily symptomatic cases 

An increase of 6% from 25,411 new daily cases last week
 
London is currently seeing a rapid rise in positive cases

Driven by omicron

Prevalence in the UK

One in 57 currently have symptomatic COVID

ZOE’s predicted Long COVID incidence rate

1,418 people a day will go on to experience symptoms for longer than 12 weeks 

Omicron symptoms

Initial analysis of symptom data from positive cases in London

To compare Delta and Omicron symptoms

London data was selected from a week in October

With the most recent week ending 10th December

This initial analysis found no clear differences in the early symptoms (3 days after test) between Delta and Omicron. 

The top five symptoms reported in the ZOE app

runny nose

headache

fatigue (either mild or severe)

sneezing

sore throat

SA Patients presentations

Blocked or runny nose

Headache

Tiredness

Scratchy or sore throat

Body aches


NHS official symptoms

The main symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are:

a high temperature 

a new, continuous cough 

a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste

Professor Tim Spector

Omicron is set to be the dominant strain in the UK by Christmas, 

and in the New Year cases could hit a peak higher than anything we’ve ever seen before. 

Hopefully people now recognise the cold-like symptoms which appear to be the predominant feature of Omicron. 

Ahead of Christmas, if people want to get together and keep vulnerable family members safe,

I’d recommend limiting social contact in the run up to Christmas,

and doing a few Lateral Flow Tests just before the big family gathering.
