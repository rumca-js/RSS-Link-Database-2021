Halo is the franchise that helped define modern first-person shooters on consoles. With the release of Halo Infinite, let's look back at its history: from Halo: Combat Evolved and the Bungie years, spin-offs like Halo Wars, and the passing of the torch to 343 Industries.

Halo: Combat Evolved helped define much of modern gaming. From how first-person shooters control on console to leading the charge for online play via Xbox Live, it's a series that's long been venerated for pushing gaming forward. It hasn't been without missteps, but with the strong launch of Halo Infinite multiplayer and all signs pointing towards a high-quality campaign. it seems that Halo is back, baby.

In the above video, we chart the history of the Halo games. Although it is a series synonymous with the Xbox console, it started life as a Mac exclusive. Halo: Combat Evolved, originally called Monkey Nuts, was an RTS game, but developer Bungie eventually refined it into the classic first-person shooter we know it as today. And the impact the game's success would have on its sequels, and spin-offs is something also explored in the video. We also discuss the passing of stewardship of the franchise from Bungie to 343 Industries, a team set up to be the new custodians of the Halo series.
