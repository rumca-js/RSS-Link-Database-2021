Join Jake Riley — aka  B Boy Boogie B — from House of Dance Twin Cities over the course of these six videos for a series of dance tutorials. By the end of these six videos, you'll be able to make some cool moves on the dance floor. In this third video, we'll learn to do transitions to the floor, aka go-downs. The three go-downs we’ll learn are the straight drop, the knee down, and the hook drop.

Originally part of our 2021 Rock the Cradle Play Along series, we're publishing these videos individually to create a simple dance course just for you — and it's fun for all ages.
