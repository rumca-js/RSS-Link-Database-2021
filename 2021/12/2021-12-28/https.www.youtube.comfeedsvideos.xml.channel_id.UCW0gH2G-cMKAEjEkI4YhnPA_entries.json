My philosophy is to make it as easy a transition into the more difficult books (like The Silmarillion) as possible.  In so doing, I've recommended a reading order that goes by difficulty and books that contain the most narrative content.\n\nBecome a supporter and join the Nerd of the Rings book club here: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\n\nMy Recommended Order\nNarrative Books:\nThe Hobbit (https://amzn.to/3qrlN5X)\nThe Lord of the Rings (https://amzn.to/341Mfvt)\nThe Children of H\u00farin (https://amzn.to/3mzQrJa)\nThe Silmarillion (https://amzn.to/3yYTWy1)\n\nSlightly academic approach:\nUnfinished Tales (https://amzn.to/3puTbtb)\nBeren and L\u00fathien (https://amzn.to/3enUjZs)\nThe Fall of Gondolin (https://amzn.to/3FAHpmM)\n\nHeavy academic approach:\nThe History of Middle-earth (https://amzn.to/3ErOCnL)\nThe Nature of Middle-earth (https://amzn.to/3sBCmyE)\nThe Letters of JRR Tolkien (https://amzn.to/3mAZKIW)\nThe History of The Hobbit (https://amzn.to/3mzXodw)\n\nBiographical Books:\nA Tolkien Biography - Humphrey Carpenter (https://amzn.to/3qv8UIb)\nJ.R.R.
