ago\n\nThe horrific scenes that we saw a year ago \u2013 \n\nintensive care units being full, \n\nlots of people dying prematurely \u2013 \n\nthat is now history in my view and I think\u2026that\u2019s likely to continue\n\nChris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers\n\nWhat our guys are saying is that incidental cases are making around 25 to 30 per cent of cases that are arriving, \nbut that will vary from place to place\n\nIn London you would expect to see higher levels\n\nlower in somewhere like the South West, where community infections are lower\n\nThey are seeing an increase in the number of hospital admissions\n\nbut it's not precipitous. \n\nIt's not going up in an exponential way \n\nAs the number of cases in the community rises, there are significant levels of incidental cases\n\nBut we mustn't forget that having those people in hospital causes complications because of infection control measures\n\nunder significant amounts of pressure and are struggling with high numbers of staff absences\n\n \n\nMore cases of incidental Covid compared to previous waves\n\nDr Raghib Ali, consultant in acute medicine at Oxford University Hospitals, \n\nThere is certainly a smaller proportion of people ending up with Covid pneumonia in intensive care \nProbably half the cases I\u2019ve seen are incidentals\n \nYou\u2019ve got completely incidental cases, \n\nsomeone coming in with a broken leg, who also tests positive for Covid, \n\nthen a third category of older people who have comorbidities. \n\nMaybe they\u2019ve had a fall or chest pain and also test positive and it's unclear if the virus is having some sort of impact.\n\nAnd when the prevalence of a virus with relatively mild symptoms is high in the community then you will see higher incidentals\n\nSimilar to Gauteng, with 52% incidentals\n\n\n\nReport from Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (May 1 to Dec 24)\n\n

the symptoms are. \n\nSlightly blocked feeling, feeling of being  a little ill for one day, slight  headache, no cough or runny nose.  \n \nThis  surprised me  because I havebeen   practicing

balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses. \n\nThese updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives. \n\nPrevention is our best option: get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial and high community transmission, and take a test before you gather.\n\nUS

skewed towards symptomatic (minority)\n\nNot all symptomatic people test\n\nNot all negative tests are true negatives\n\nQuarantine has been costly\n \nThus, the following is applicable with immediate effect:\n \nAll contact tracing be stopped with immediate effect,\n\nexcept in congregate settings and cluster outbreak situations or self-contained\n\nAll contacts must continue with their normal duties with heightened monitoring\n\n(daily temperature testing, symptom screening) of any early signs. \n\nIf they develop symptoms then they should be tested and be managed according to the severity of the symptoms\n\nAll contacts must not be tested unless if they develop symptoms\n \nQuarantining for contacts of confirmed cases of Covid -19\n\nAll quarantine is to be stopped with immediate effect\n\nThis applies to both vaccinated and unvaccinated contacts\n\nNo testing for Covid -19 is required irrespective of the risk exposure unless the contact becomes symptomatic\n
