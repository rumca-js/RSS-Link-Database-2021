13:29 THE Opportunity


2021 saw the regular 2 GNOME updates, GNOME 40 and 41.

First, a lot of people didn't like the horizontal workspaces, but also libadwaita.

Budgie are going to distance themselves from these technologies, and move to EFL, the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries. A real new desktop creation will be Cosmic, by System76, creators of PopOS.

All of this didn't stop GNOME from moving forwards with their intended technological path, namely libadwaita, a widget + theme library that apps can use to avoid reinventing the wheel everytime they need a button, control, list view, etc...

KDE had a less eventful year, although they did publish 3 new releases: Plasma 5.21, 22 and 23, which was also the 25th anniversary edition of Plasma. This desktop focused on polish, and fixing the settings.

2021 also saw the release of elementary OS 6 ODIN, after more than 1000 days had passed the previous release, and, 4 months later, its next point update, 6.1 Jolnir.

2021 also saw the introduction of Cutefish, a mac os inspired desktop environment that holds promise, even though it's far from ready for daily use.

Now in terms of technologies, the Linux desktop has also seen some impressive changes in 2021.

The Wayland transition is now basically complete for both GNOME and KDE. Wayland is THE most important change in the Linux desktop ever, and it's finally there. 2022 will definitely see most major distros use Wayland by default for all GPUs.

Another major technological advance is Flatpak and portals. These 2 technologies have rampaged through most distros and DEs in 2021, clearly setting themselves as the future of how applications are distributed and how they operate with each other.

2021 also saw Ubuntu move to Flutter as their default app development technology.

In terms of hardware,  Linux saw a bunch of interesting developments in 2021. 

We saw new versions of the Pinephone, with more RAM, and new distros preinstalled on it. They also announced the Pinephone PRO, a more heavy duty version, that shares the same chassis, but has way better cameras and specs. They also announced the PineNote, an e-ink tablet with stylus, and made the PineTIme available.

ARM computing also got a boost with the release of Asahi Linux and the Linux kernel 5.13, which bring initial support for Apple Silicon macs on Linux.

Still on the ARM side of things, we saw the first Linux tablet come out. The JingPad A1 might still run an Android kernel with halium, but they do use a fork of KDE Plasma for their desktop.

Probably THE biggest news in 2021 was the Steam Deck. Valve announced, without too much fuss, their handheld PC, first codenamed the Steampal.

This is a very crucial milestone for Linux and Linux gaming; this device is a premium piece of gaming hardware made by one of the biggest game focused companies in the world, and it runs Arch Linux.

SteamOS 3 will be an immutable OS based on Arch, that ships a dedicated steam interface, proton, and indicators for people to know which games work or not, powered by manual Valve reviews.

It also sparked plenty of new developments on proton, the library that lets us play most windows games on Linux. The biggest one is of course, the announcement of anti cheat support from EAC and BattleEye.

We also saw a lot of games seeing proton patches after their release to have day one support, and work on DLSS and AMD's supersampling technology, FidelityFX, also made sure that even low powered GPUs can play recent games at decent resolutions.
