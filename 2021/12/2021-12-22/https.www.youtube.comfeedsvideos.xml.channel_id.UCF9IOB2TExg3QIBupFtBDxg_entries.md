Less people going to hospital with Omicron infection compared to Delta infection. Apologies, I had a few technical problems with todays video

https://joinzoe.com/learn/new-omicron-variant

144,284 new daily symptomatic cases of COVID in the UK

In people who have had at least 2 vaccine doses

56,346 new daily symptomatic cases in the UK

70% + cases in England are now Omicron 

The UK R value, 1.2

R value in London is 1.5.

From 17,000 omicron cases

Runny nose

Headache

Fatigue (either mild or severe)

Sneezing

Sore throat

(NHS test and trace is not telling users of their Omicron status anymore)

Report 50 - Hospitalisation risk for Omicron cases in England

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/risk-of-hospital-stay-40-lower-with-omicron-than-delta-uk-data-suggests

Differences in the risk of hospitalisation between Omicron and Delta

1st to 14th December inclusive

Analysed data from all PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in England

Cases

S-gene Target Failure (SGTF) and genetic data

Omicron, n = 56,000

Delta, n = 269,000

Reduction in the risk of hospitalisation for Omicron relative to Delta infections 

Endpoint, any attendance at hospital

20-25% reduced risk

Endpoint, hospitalisation lasting 1 day or longer

40-45% reduced risk

These reductions must be balanced against the larger risk of infection with Omicron, 
due to the reduction in protection provided by both vaccination and natural infection. 

Intrinsic differences in severity between Omicron and Delta

Omicron may result in slightly less severe disease

From the few neither previously infected nor vaccinated, 

risk of hospitalisation, 11% lower for Omicron versus Delta

Level of protection from previous infection

Reduces the risk of any hospitalisation by 50% 

Reduces the risk of a hospital stay of 1+ days by 61%

Risk of symptomatic infection with omicron

More protection after PF/MD than AZ 

Hospitalisation risk by vaccination state

AstraZenca (AZ) (doses 1 and 2)

Omicron hazard ratios are lower than for Delta

Pfizer or Moderna (PF/MD) (doses 1 and 2)

Omicron hazard ratios are similar to those seen for Delta

Conclusions, after at least 2 vaccine doses

Protection against omicron infection has been largely lost

Remain substantially protected against hospitalisation

Does not substantially change Sage modelling

Pointing to 3,000 daily hospitalisations in England at the peak next month



Omicron cases in Scotland, Eave II study

https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/severity-of-omicron-variant-of-concern-and-vaccine-effectiveness-

Hospital data from 23 November to 19 December

Risk of hospitalisation, 70% lower with Omicron than Delta.

15 hospitalisations with Omicron

Opposed to the 47 admissions from delta

(Expected given the characteristics of those infected)

First case of Omicron confirmed by viral sequencing was recorded in Scotland on November 23, 2021

By December 19, 2021, there were 23,840 S gene negative cases. 

These S gene negative cases were predominantly in the age group 20-39 (11,732; 49.2%). 

Reinfections, more than 10 times more likely with omicron

Omicron positive cases that were reinfections, 7.6%

Delta cases that were 
reinfections, 0.7%

The third/booster vaccine dose was associated with a 57% reduction in the risk of symptomatic omicron infection

(relative to ≥25 weeks post second dose)


Interpretation 

These early national data suggest that Omicron is associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation when compared to Delta. 

Whilst offering the greatest protection against Delta, the third/booster dose of vaccination offers substantial additional protection against the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 for Omicron,

when compared to ≥25 weeks post second vaccine dose.

Australian thinking

To stop omicron with vaccination, near 100% efficacy with near 100% uptake

With no waning

Natural infection promotes antibody IgA

(vaccines generate IgM then IgG

Preventing vial replication in the upper airways

Allowing omicron infection up to the point where hospitalisations are manageable

Less pathogenic with shorter hospital stays

Natural immunity giving cross immunity to the next variant

Concurrent booster programme for the elderly and comorbid

Over time need for pharmaceutical and NPIs will diminish

If hospitalisations do rise, population will self-titrate

PM Mr Morrison

The modelling assumed the Omicron strain is as serious as Delta

Failed to account for boosters

or people taking sensible behavioural responses in what they're doing

So I wouldn't want to alarm people over that report. 

That is not what we are actually expecting to happen

The grim predictions were highly unlikely

There is a range of scenarios, 

of course the number of Omicron cases will increase.

It's highly infectious. 

But the indications are that it is not as severe and our hospitals, 

in NSW and Victoria, have been coping extremely well

Professor Paul Kelly, Australia chief medical officer

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10333919/Coronavirus-Australia-Australias-Chief-Medical-Officer-hits-doomsday-Omicron-predictions.html

selective and misleading media reporting about ongoing modelling

the predicted hospitalisation estimations are unlikely.

Evidence about the characteristics of Omicron is still emerging but early trends seen both internationally and within Australia suggest that it is more transmissible

However, early indications around hospitalisation, ICU admission and death show that Omicron could be far less than Delta and other variants 

Importantly, after almost four weeks of Omicron in Australia there are currently no confirmed Omicron cases in ICU and no deaths confirmed to date

Modelling, it's one of a range of tools and can't be viewed in isolation

A preliminary scenario, of many being considered to help inform decision making

Presents one of the worst case of all potential scenarios

including assumptions that the Omicron variant is as severe as the Delta variant, 

an absence of hospital surge capacity, 

a highly limited booster program, 

no change to baseline public health and social measures

and an absence of spontaneous behaviour change in the face of rising case numbers

None of these five assumptions represent the likely state of events, let alone all of them together, 

therefore presenting that scenario as the likely scenario that will occur is highly misleading

Former deputy chief health officer Nick Coatsworth 

Whoever leaked the Doherty modelling without context has committed a gross injustice to the Australian people

Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt 

Despite the rapid spread of Omicron

only a fraction of cases were ending up in hospitals

People infected with Covid in England,

stop self-isolating,

negative lateral flows on day six and day seven

Strongly advised to limit, contact with vulnerable, crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, work from home

Sajid Javid acting on expert advice

Applies to everyone, regardless of vaccination status

Should still isolate if symptomatic

People not double-jabbed who have close contact with a positive case must still isolate for a full 10 days
