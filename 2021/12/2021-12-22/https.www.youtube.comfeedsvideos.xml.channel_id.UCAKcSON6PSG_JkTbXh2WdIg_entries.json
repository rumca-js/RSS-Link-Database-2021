Kristen Stewart delivers a fascinating portrait of Princess Diana while Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood provides a haunting soundtrack.\n\n\"The acting is amazing,\" Mary says. \"You will be questioning, did this really happen? Or is this just the possible imaginings of a woman trapped in a loveless marriage, with the monarchy as in-laws, and all the protocol and all of the restrictions?\"\n\nThe film is directed by Pablo Larrain and written by Steven Knight. \"It's probably not what you think,\" Mary says, \"but it's really well worth a look.\"\n\n\"Spencer\" is available through Amazon Prime, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and Microsoft Store.\n\nWATCH MORE LISTEN TO LOOCH:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYClJc3TpV5J_sXyCfes-p6vCgOpCmleh\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#spencerfilm #marylucia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nodrj_D72-s", "date_published": "2021-12-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "The Jayhawks - three live songs (2019)", "description": "Two years ago tonight, The Current streamed live video of the Jayhawks in concert from the Palace Theatre in St. Paul.
