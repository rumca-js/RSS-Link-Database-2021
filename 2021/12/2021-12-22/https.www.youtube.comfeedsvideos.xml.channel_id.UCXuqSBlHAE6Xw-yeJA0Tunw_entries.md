Volvo's latest XC40 Recharge Electric vehicle has a new trick up its sleeve - Android Automotive, a full infotainment system from Google. Rather than designing the best way for your smartphone to integrate into the media system, Android Automotive can do practically everything without even needing to think about a phone - there's even a Play Store to download apps!
