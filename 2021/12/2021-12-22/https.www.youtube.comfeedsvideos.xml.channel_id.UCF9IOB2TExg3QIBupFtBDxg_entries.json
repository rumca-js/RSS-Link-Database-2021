reduced risk\n\nEndpoint, hospitalisation lasting 1 day or longer\n\n40-45% reduced risk\n\nThese reductions must be balanced against the larger risk of infection with Omicron, \ndue to the reduction in protection provided by both vaccination and natural infection. \n\nIntrinsic differences in severity between Omicron and Delta\n\nOmicron may result in slightly less severe disease\n\nFrom the few

the characteristics of those infected)\n\nFirst case of Omicron confirmed by viral sequencing was recorded in Scotland on November 23, 2021\n\nBy December 19, 2021, there were 23,840 S gene negative cases. \n\nThese S gene negative cases were predominantly in the age group 20-39 (11,732; 49.2%). \n\nReinfections, more than 10 times more likely with omicron\n\nOmicron positive cases that were

\u226525 weeks post second dose)\n\n\nInterpretation \n\nThese early national data suggest that Omicron is associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation when compared to Delta. \n\nWhilst offering the greatest protection against Delta, the third/booster dose of vaccination offers substantial additional protection against the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 for

account for boosters\n\nor people taking sensible behavioural responses in what they're doing\n\nSo I wouldn't want to alarm people over that report. \n\nThat is not what we are actually expecting to happen\n\nThe grim predictions were highly unlikely\n\nThere is a range of scenarios, \n\nof course the number of Omicron cases will increase.\n\nIt's highly infectious. \n\nBut the indications are that it is not as severe and our hospitals, \n\nin NSW and Victoria, have been coping extremely well\n\nProfessor Paul Kelly, Australia chief medical officer\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10333919/Coronavirus-Australia-Australias-Chief-Medical-Officer-hits-doomsday-Omicron-predictions.html\n\nselective and misleading media reporting about ongoing modelling\n\nthe predicted hospitalisation estimations are unlikely.\n\nEvidence about the characteristics of Omicron is still emerging but early trends seen both internationally and within Australia suggest that it is more transmissible\n\nHowever, early indications around hospitalisation, ICU admission and death show that Omicron could be far less than Delta and other variants \n\nImportantly, after almost four weeks of Omicron in Australia there are currently no confirmed Omicron cases in ICU and no deaths confirmed to date\n\nModelling, it's one of a range of tools and can't be viewed in isolation\n\nA preliminary scenario, of many being considered to help inform decision making\n\nPresents one of the worst case of all potential scenarios\n\nincluding assumptions that the Omicron variant is as severe as the Delta variant, \n\nan absence of hospital surge capacity, \n\na highly limited booster program, \n\nno change to baseline public health and social measures\n\nand an absence of spontaneous behaviour change in the face of rising case numbers\n\nNone of these five assumptions represent the likely state of events, let alone all of them together, \n\ntherefore presenting that scenario as the likely scenario that will occur is highly misleading\n\nFormer deputy chief health officer Nick Coatsworth \n\nWhoever leaked the Doherty modelling
