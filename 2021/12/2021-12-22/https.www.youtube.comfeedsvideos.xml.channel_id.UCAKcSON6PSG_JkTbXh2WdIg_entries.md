This week, Mary Lucia talks about "Spencer," a film that imagines a Christmas with the Royal Family in the 1980s. Kristen Stewart delivers a fascinating portrait of Princess Diana while Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood provides a haunting soundtrack.

"The acting is amazing," Mary says. "You will be questioning, did this really happen? Or is this just the possible imaginings of a woman trapped in a loveless marriage, with the monarchy as in-laws, and all the protocol and all of the restrictions?"

The film is directed by Pablo Larrain and written by Steven Knight. "It's probably not what you think," Mary says, "but it's really well worth a look."

"Spencer" is available through Amazon Prime, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and Microsoft Store.
