In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia discusses the free PlayStation Plus games that were reportedly leaked for January, Tesla is being investigated for letting drivers play behind the wheel, and more.

As shared by Wario64 on Twitter and reported by Dealabs, January's games that are rumored to be featured in the monthly subscription service includes Persona 5 Strikers, the spin-off title which first launched earlier this year in February for PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Alongside that, Deep Rock Galactic and Dirt 5 could also be included.

Later in the video, Persia talks about a report from the LA Times. Tesla is being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration following a complaint to the agency that owners can play games while the vehicle is moving. According to the agency and a new document posted to its website, the feature called "Passenger Play" could distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash.

And lastly, Guillermo del Toro is not working on a new Silent Hill project, despite fan speculation following the Oscar-winning director's recent tease at The Game Awards. Del Toro said in an interview with the Happy Sad Confused podcast where he went on to say, "I kind of just wanted to tickle the ribs of Konami.”

New gaming consoles come and go every few years, but PC gaming endures with some of the best hardware and software that's exclusive to that platform. This year was no exception, as PC gamers had access to imaginative and genre-bending titles, games that pushed the flexible nature of those systems in wild new directions.

While PC gaming shared many a hit game with its console brethren, for this list we're looking at the games that could only be found on this platform...with one exception. That means no Resident Evil Village and its incredibly tall ladies, no Deathloop and its masterful approach to Groundhog Day gunplay, and no Halo Infinite reviving the beloved FPS franchise. In this list, it's the efforts of small studios and indie developers that took the top spots, bringing about an exciting selection of games in 2021.
