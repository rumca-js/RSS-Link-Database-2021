What it’s like Christmas shoplifting in California! As California politicians and lawmakers have decriminalized crime, Christmas is more affordable than ever. Stealing items under a $950 value means you don’t get prosecuted. And that means you get to take more to give more gifts. And that’s the Christmas spirit. Merry Christmas!
