I'll have special guests like Cliff from @TheOneRing and Yoystan from \u200b @Men of the West  and we will read your comments, answer questions, and share thoughts of our own in kind of a running \"Fan Commentary\" with the film.\n\n*If you are unaware, I cannot legally stream the actual film, which is why we will merely be syncing together in this watch party format.  I will have a running timer throughout, so if you come late or get interrupted, you can easily locate our position in the film!\n\nTo learn more about our holiday initiative to donate copies of The Hobbit to kids in need, check out this video: https://youtu.be/R_P8W1i8M98\n\n#lotr20 #fellowshipofthering #lordoftherings", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNQIXfkoOJM", "date_published": "2021-12-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
