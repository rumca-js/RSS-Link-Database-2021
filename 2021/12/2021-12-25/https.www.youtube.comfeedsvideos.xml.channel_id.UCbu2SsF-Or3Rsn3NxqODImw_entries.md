Gaming shotguns come in many shapes and sizes, from the archetypal Remington 870 seen in the likes of Resident Evil and Battlefield 2042, to the sci-fi styled SPAS-12 that inspired Aliens’ iconic Pulse Rifle. Whether they’re packing double barrels or drum magazines, shotguns have made quite the impact on our pop culture. But how close are the shotguns found in our games to the real-world weapons they represent?

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson about the breadth and variety of shotguns, from the classic double-barrelled flintlocks through to the ridiculous revolving Striker shotgun.
