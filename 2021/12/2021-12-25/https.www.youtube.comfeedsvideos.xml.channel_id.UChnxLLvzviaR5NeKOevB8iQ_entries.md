I recently got the Make Noise Erbe-Verb, a wild algorithmic reverb that is much more of a sound design effect than a proper reverb. That's ok, I got lots of reverb, I'd rather play with it like it's a crazy friend.

So this jam was a test of how Erbe sounds on drums. I added a TON of new samples to my Erica Synth Sample Drum and will be doing a lot more drum loop worth with it.

Nebulae is also in play, since I just make a bunch of new samples for it using the Native Instruments Arkhis Kontant Library.
