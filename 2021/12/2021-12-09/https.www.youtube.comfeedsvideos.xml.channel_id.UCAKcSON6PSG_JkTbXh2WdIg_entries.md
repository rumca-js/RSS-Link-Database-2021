Join Jake Riley — aka B Boy Boogie B — from House of Dance Twin Cities over the course of these six videos for a series of dance tutorials. By the end of these six videos, you'll be able to make some cool moves on the dance floor. In this sixth video, we'll learn to do three power moves: the back spin, knee spin and the windmill.

Originally part of our 2021 Rock the Cradle Play Along series, we're publishing these videos individually to create a simple dance course just for you — and it's fun for all ages.
