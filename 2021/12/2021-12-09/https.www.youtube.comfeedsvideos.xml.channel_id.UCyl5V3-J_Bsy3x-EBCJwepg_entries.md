Dan Dillon designed Not The Bee too.

Kyle, Ethan, Dan, and Austin go through the week’s weird news including an Italian man avoiding the vaccine with a fake arm, a breastfeeding airline passenger whose child might actually be a cat, and the money that is pouring out of the walls of Joel Osten’s church bathroom. They talk about the week’s Banger and Bomb of the Week at The Babylon Bee, including how the unemployment rate for both Cuomo brothers has gone up 100%.
