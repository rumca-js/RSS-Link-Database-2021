I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of  LOTS of various goodness here, street scene, Beverly Hills, street scene with policeman directing traffic, people in pharmacy / drugstore milling around, shopping, railroad track in lightly populated suburban area, 
railroad tracks in station probably located in Los Angeles; passengers, including man in military uniform, walk by camera; streamlined steam locomotive bearing Southern Pacific Lines livery enters frame from right


Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
