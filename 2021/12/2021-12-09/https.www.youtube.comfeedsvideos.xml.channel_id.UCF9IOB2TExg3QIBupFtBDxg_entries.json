admissions from Omicron should be expected to follow soon (high confidence).\n\nThough there remain some important uncertainties, \n\nEarly verbal reports indicate that hospitalisations due to Omicron are now increasing in South Africa.\n\nThe doubling time for new Omicron infections is currently around 3 days in England\n\nIt is unlikely to be any slower than a 5-day doubling time (high confidence)\n\nHousehold studies show higher secondary attack rates (high confidence).\n\nWhy is omicron more transmissible?\n\nCombinations of transmissibility and immune escape\n\nSome early indications from South Africa suggest less severe disease in those hospitalised\n\nA modest reduction in severity would not avert high numbers of hospitalisations if growth rates remained very high.\n\nOne thousand per day be end of month\n\nThe peak is highly likely to be higher than 1,000 to 2,000 Omicron hospital admissions per day without intervention\n\nFor it to be below this level there would need to be only a small degree of immune escape and very high protection from boosters against Omicron\n\nWith very rapid doubling times a large wave could occur leading to synchronous absences from work.\n\nWith lags of the order of two or more weeks, \n\nand doubling times of the order of three days, \n\nit is likely that, once hospitalisations begin to increase at a rate similar to that of cases, \n\nfour doublings (a 16-fold increase) or more could already be \u201cin the system\u201d\n\nA greater role for airborne transmission\nVentilation, well-fitting masks and distancing or reduced density of people in indoor environments may be even more important.\n\nMichael\n\nIn your talk about the Oslo party you embrace another wrong inference that many people like to believe, \n\nthat claims that viruses tend to become less lethal because \u201cnot killing their host\u201d keeps the viruses in the host alive too\n\nand enables the host to keep infecting, making the virus more contagious. \n\nThis claim may be contested even in the general case, \n\nbut it\u2019s certainly wrong for SARS-COV 2 since as you pointed out many times \u2013 \n\nthe death of the victim almost always happens after he is no longer infectious \n\nand this means that prolonging the life of the victim does not prolong the period of infectivity.", "link":

Institute of Public Health\n\nOne of three scenarios for omicron,\nit would be both very mild and very transmissible\n\nThat is the hope \nThat is the best scenario we can have\n\nThat it's getting minder, \n\nmost people will get it, \n\nand they will get a natural immunity\n\nIt might be that it has now replicated and mutated so many times,\n\nthat this is the optimal position from the virus' point of view, \n\nto spread widely and not kill the hosts \n\nThat's what we've seen with other diseases beforehand. \n\nAnd of course, then it gets into more like an endemic phase\n\nNow this is not the end\nNor is it the end of the beginning\nRather it is the beginning of the end\n\nSally\nI've had Delta, this time last year (pretty rough, took 6 months to fully recover) and I have Omicron now.
