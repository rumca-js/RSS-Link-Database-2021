Omicron is displaying a significant growth advantage over Delta, 

likely to outcompete Delta in the UK and become the dominant variant.

If the growth rate and doubling time continue,

at least 50% of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases to be caused by Omicron variant by mid-December

One million by end of December

1% = 10,000

Omicron displays a reduction in protection offered by having had a previous infection or vaccination.

There is insufficient data to make any assessment of protection against severe disease, 

or to assess the severity of illness caused by Omicron. 

Further studies are underway in the UK and abroad.

Hospital admissions from Omicron should be expected to follow soon (high confidence).

Though there remain some important uncertainties, 

Early verbal reports indicate that hospitalisations due to Omicron are now increasing in South Africa.

The doubling time for new Omicron infections is currently around 3 days in England

It is unlikely to be any slower than a 5-day doubling time (high confidence)

Household studies show higher secondary attack rates (high confidence).

Why is omicron more transmissible?

Combinations of transmissibility and immune escape

Some early indications from South Africa suggest less severe disease in those hospitalised

A modest reduction in severity would not avert high numbers of hospitalisations if growth rates remained very high.

One thousand per day be end of month

The peak is highly likely to be higher than 1,000 to 2,000 Omicron hospital admissions per day without intervention

For it to be below this level there would need to be only a small degree of immune escape and very high protection from boosters against Omicron

With very rapid doubling times a large wave could occur leading to synchronous absences from work.

With lags of the order of two or more weeks, 

and doubling times of the order of three days, 

it is likely that, once hospitalisations begin to increase at a rate similar to that of cases, 

four doublings (a 16-fold increase) or more could already be “in the system”

A greater role for airborne transmission
Ventilation, well-fitting masks and distancing or reduced density of people in indoor environments may be even more important.

Michael

In your talk about the Oslo party you embrace another wrong inference that many people like to believe, 

that claims that viruses tend to become less lethal because “not killing their host” keeps the viruses in the host alive too

and enables the host to keep infecting, making the virus more contagious. 

This claim may be contested even in the general case, 

but it’s certainly wrong for SARS-COV 2 since as you pointed out many times – 

the death of the victim almost always happens after he is no longer infectious 

and this means that prolonging the life of the victim does not prolong the period of infectivity.

Oslo, Norway, Christmas party

Scatec solar power company

One or two returned traveller

Had returned days earlier

120 people (all double vaccinated)

Mingled with outside groups later

70 of the 120 plus 50 others tested positive

Half tested positive for omicron

13 proven in sequencing

Dr. Tine Ravlo, Oslo, infectious diseases

They have symptoms like fever, cough, headache, muscle pain,  fatigue, 

but for now none of them have become severely ill and none of them have been treated in hospital

The next day, one of two employees,

recently returned from South Africa tested positive

Norway's state epidemiologist, Frode Forland

Sheer number of people infected at a single event, omicron considerably more infectious than delta

Prof Forland, Norwegian Institute of Public Health

One of three scenarios for omicron,
it would be both very mild and very transmissible

That is the hope 
That is the best scenario we can have

That it's getting minder, 

most people will get it, 

and they will get a natural immunity

It might be that it has now replicated and mutated so many times,

that this is the optimal position from the virus' point of view, 

to spread widely and not kill the hosts 

That's what we've seen with other diseases beforehand. 

And of course, then it gets into more like an endemic phase

Now this is not the end
Nor is it the end of the beginning
Rather it is the beginning of the end

Sally
I've had Delta, this time last year (pretty rough, took 6 months to fully recover) and I have Omicron now. The symptoms of Omicron are as you state. I am vaccinated. 

Helgard
Living in SA (Gauteng) and have tested (+) 2 days ago, The symptoms is 100% correct as stated. Also after 1st symptoms, 3 days after i don't even know that i was sick.

Body and muscle aches and pains

Headache

Tiredness (1 to 2 days)

Slight sore throat

No severe cough 

No runny nose

Sir Patrick Vallance

from pandemic to endemic where this becomes a more regular infection like flu over time

This virus has mutated a lot, quickly and that is sort of what you would expect at this stage

the good news is that, so far, it looks as though when you get very high antibody levels with the booster vaccine it's definitely having some effect against it in the laboratory studies

Can you explain how one variant replaces the other? Does the other variant just fade out?
