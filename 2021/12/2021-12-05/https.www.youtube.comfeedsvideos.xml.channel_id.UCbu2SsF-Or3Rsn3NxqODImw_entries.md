In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Halo Infinite Boss Explains What Went Wrong With The 2020 Campaign Demo, Halo Infinite Is Adding More Playlists Soon, But Slayer Isn't Ready Yet and details about Call of Duty Warzone’s Pacific map launch.  

In this video, DeVante talks about what went wrong with Halo Infinite’s 2020 demo. 343’s Bonnie Ross explained because developers were mostly working from home at the time due to the pandemic and not everyone working on the game saw the same picture quality for the demo.

DeVante also talks about when Halo Infinite’s multiplayer will get additional playlists.  Fiesta, Tactical Slayer (SWAT), and Free-For-All are on the way, however they won't be in the game on December 8 when the campaign launches.  

Later in the video, DeVante talks about Call of Duty: Warzone finally getting its long-awaited new Pacific-themed map this week and how players can get early access.

Halo is the franchise that helped define modern first-person shooters on consoles. With the release of Halo Infinite, let's look back at its history: from Halo: Combat Evolved and the Bungie years, spin-offs like Halo Wars, and the passing of the torch to 343 Industries. 

Vice article: https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwqjg3/the-complete-untold-history-of-halo-an-oral-history 

Halo: Combat Evolved helped define much of modern gaming. From how first-person shooters control on console to leading the charge for online play via Xbox Live, it's a series that's long been venerated for pushing gaming forward. It hasn't been without missteps, but with the strong launch of Halo Infinite multiplayer and all signs pointing towards a high-quality campaign. it seems that Halo is back, baby.

In the above video, we chart the history of the Halo games. Although it is a series synonymous with the Xbox console, it started life as a Mac exclusive. Halo: Combat Evolved, originally called Monkey Nuts, was an RTS game, but developer Bungie eventually refined it into the classic first-person shooter we know it as today. And the impact the game's success would have on its sequels, and spin-offs is something also explored in the video. We also discuss the passing of stewardship of the franchise from Bungie to 343 Industries, a team set up to be the new custodians of the Halo series.
