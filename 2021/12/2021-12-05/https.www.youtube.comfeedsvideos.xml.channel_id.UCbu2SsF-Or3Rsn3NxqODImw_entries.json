With the release of Halo Infinite, let's look back at its history: from Halo: Combat Evolved and the Bungie years, spin-offs like Halo Wars, and the passing of the torch to 343 Industries. \n\nVice article: https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwqjg3/the-complete-untold-history-of-halo-an-oral-history \n\nHalo: Combat Evolved helped define much of modern gaming. From how first-person shooters control on console to leading the charge for online play via Xbox Live, it's a series that's long been venerated for pushing gaming forward. It hasn't been without missteps, but with the strong launch of Halo Infinite multiplayer and all signs pointing towards a high-quality campaign. it seems that Halo is back, baby.\n\nIn the above video, we chart the history of the Halo games. Although it is a series synonymous with the Xbox console, it started life as a Mac exclusive. Halo: Combat Evolved, originally called Monkey Nuts, was an RTS game, but developer Bungie eventually refined it into the classic first-person shooter we know it as today. And the impact the game's success would have on its sequels, and spin-offs is something also explored in the video. We also discuss the passing of stewardship of the franchise from Bungie to 343 Industries, a team set up to be the new custodians of the Halo series.\n\nFor more on Halo, make sure to check out our Halo Infinite multiplayer review, our tips guides on how to dominate when playing online, and our latest episode of Firearms Expert Reacts, in which Jonathan Ferguson from the Royal Armouries breaks down the weapons in the game.
