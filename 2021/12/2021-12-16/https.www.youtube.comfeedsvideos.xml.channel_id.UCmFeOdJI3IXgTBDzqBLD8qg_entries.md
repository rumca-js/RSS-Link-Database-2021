Vile Eye| 'Analyzing Evil: Walter White From Breaking Bad'

Breaking Bad tells us the story of Walter White. Which teaches us the truth about money, business, the banking crisis, big pharma, politics, and most importantly it shines a mirror on ourselves. Is money, investing in a business empire, and being a millionaire worth it for tearing up your family in the process and eroding your identity? Walter White highlights the Jungian idea of the shadow self and how the shadow's pursuit of money, wealth, business success, and more comes from the repression felt by the persona.
