The Babylon Bee guys are joined by Joe Baldwin from Strategic Swine Solutions to talk about how California is soon going to run out of bacon, leaving them in a post-apocalyptic nightmare straight from Satan. The guys also set up a dating profile for Catholic Patrick on a Reformed dating site. The Weekly News gets a revamp with Adam Yenser taking the lead and there’s the latest Heroes of the Faith featuring Canadian nudist bombers.
