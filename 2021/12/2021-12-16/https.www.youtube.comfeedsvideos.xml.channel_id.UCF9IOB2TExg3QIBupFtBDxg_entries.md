Omicron wave, going to peak very quickly 

Infections doubling every 2 to 3 days

NHS, reduction in supply and increase in demand
more records would be broken

Omicron as well as delta?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-59664383

Number of omicron infections is rising very fast

Delta cases are flat

and that Delta is not going away, but being built on

If doubling time is every 3 days

Christmas Eve, cases + 462,704 

Next few days, 2 million testing positive

Forced into 10 days isolation

Their contacts may also be symptomatic

Testing capacity exceeded

(Country currently averaging 790,000 PCR tests a day)

Professor Andrew Hayward (SAGE)

Outbreak spreading faster than tests can keep up

If you think about getting a year's worth of rain over a month, then you're going to get flooding and potentially severe flooding, no matter how much you've shored up your defences

Professor David Spiegelhalter (statistician)

Reduced socialisation will slow spread down

If it kept on this doubling every two days, you get to 11 million on Christmas Day,

and the entire country on New Year's Eve

Now, this is not sensible

Millions of people are going to catch this over the next few weeks and months

That we know that's going to happen

It could be considerably better than last winter, it could be worse

South Africa now

Cases are rising steeply in all provinces

Cases in the 4th wave are higher than the peaks in all previous waves

Hospitalisations and deaths are not currently following this trend and,

are still relatively low 

Most admissions to hospitals are still for unvaccinated people

Pfizer Boosters have been approved and can be given 6 months after full vaccination

The first people will be eligible at the end of December

I'm living in South Africa. 

The masses of our population live in townships and are unvaccinated. 

There are no masks or any social distancing ever since the "pandemic" started. 

The Elephant üêò is in the room and is being ignored. 

We're only 25-30% fully vaccinated. 

16 seater minibus üöê taxis commute the masses of the people daily, no masks or social distancing. 

Hospitalizations and deaths are way lower than a year ago. 

Natural Immunity needs to come back to the discussion and needs to stop being downplayed or disregarded by the MSM.

World Health Organization

Omicron is spreading across the globe at an unprecedented rate

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-59656385

Dr Tedros 
Surely, we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril. 

Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems
