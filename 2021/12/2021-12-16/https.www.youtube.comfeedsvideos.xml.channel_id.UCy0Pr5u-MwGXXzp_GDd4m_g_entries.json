And while I did NOT book the job, I still worked really hard on my tape and so I wanted to share it with you all. For the audition you get roughly 5 minutes to showcase as many characters, impressions, accents and talents you can do. I also sent a writing package that includes 5 original sketches... all before a 2 week deadline. This was my first time ever auditioning for the show. I learned a lot and I hope I get another shot next year!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR52DcLgk_s", "date_published": "2021-12-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
