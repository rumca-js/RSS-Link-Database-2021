Since the late '90s, GameSpot has awarded Game of the Year to the one game each year that stood above the rest. After crowning our Game of the Year 2021, we decided to look back on our history and reflect on every game we decided was the best of the best.

From classics like Diablo and The Sims and blockbuster action titles like Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War, to peaceful meditations like Journey and competitive shooters like Overwatch--our GOTY award is an annual celebration of the diverse experiences video games can offer us. Which games did you enjoy the most in these 25 years.

Here's every game we've awarded Game of the Year in GameSpot's entire history.

In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Halo Infinite’s co-op campaign is now playable with a glitch, Halo TV series having its own canon, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2’s NFT backlash. 

In this video, DeVante talks about a glitch allowing players to enable Halo Infinite’s co-op campaign with a number of caveats. Player two has no HUD. The game's FOBs (Forward Operating Bases) are completely busted, and if either player dies, the game locks up. Trying to enable co-op may also break Halo Infinite game saves. 

DeVante also talks about how the upcoming Halo TV series will not play around within any of the established canon and will instead tell its story in what it calls the "Silver Timeline."

The GTA Trilogy: Definitive Edition is finally out, and not quite what everyone was hoping for. Dave Klein of DaveControl took the opportunity to play all three games - GTA 3, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas in order to see how they held up today. Or... how much the GTA Trilogy: Definitive Edition botched the execution on the Grand Theft Auto Trilogy.

In this episode of GameSpot News, FFXIV Sales are suspended due to server congestion, New World’s Winter Convergence Event goes live and a free access weekend starts for Call of Duty: Vanguard’s multiplayer. 

In this video, DeVante talks about how Square Enix will temporarily suspend the sales of both Final Fantasy 14's base game and the complete edition. Since the release of the game’s Endwalker expansion, long queues to even get into the game's servers have been a headache for both players and devs. In response to the long wait times, Square Enix released another announcement with what steps it's taking to address the congestion.

DeVante also talks about New World’s Winter Convergence Festival live from December 16 to January 11, 2022. Players can earn Winter Tokens from repeatable quests across Aeternum to earn exclusive new armor, weapons, and more, as they look to stop the evil Winter Warrior from plunging the land into the dreaded Forever Winter.

Lucy and Tamoor talk about why Arkane's latest game, Deathloop, deserves to be the GameSpot's Game of the Year 2021.  The duo discusses how the studio took the best of open-ended action, immersive sims, and rogue-lites to present something that distinct and exceptional.

A good magic trick makes the impossible seem possible and inspires a child-like sense of wonder. Watch any magician dazzle an audience with a sleight of hand, misdirection, or optical illusion and you'll see even the most stoic of people wearing an expression of astonishment. It's a unique kind of joy that is almost always followed by a desperate need to figure out the trick. "How?" onlookers will ask, trying to make sense of it.

For years now, developer Arkane Studios has been pulling off some of the most impressive magic tricks around. Through the Dishonored series and Prey, it has delivered worlds that are stunning and intricately designed, and that--most importantly--present the player with seemingly endless possibilities. This is all on top of stunning art direction, memorable characters, and compelling stories.

Arkane's games feel like impossible creations, each one a complex set of interlocking systems and mechanics that present a dynamic space where players are invited to poke and prod at their clockwork nature and watch as it reacts without falling apart. As an immersive sim and an action game, Deathloop is yet another impressive effort from Arkane in this respect. But what elevates it and makes it GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2021 is that it gives us all what we want most after being wowed by a magic trick: a peek behind the curtain.
