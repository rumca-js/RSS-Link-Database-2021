Higher hospital admissions among children during a fourth wave

Driven by the Omicron variant

Should prompt vigilance but not panic,

as infections have been mild

Ntsakisi Maluleke, public health specialist, Gauteng province

1,511 COVID-positive patients in hospitals

113 were under 9 years old, 

a greater proportion than during previous waves

We are comforted by clinicians' reports that the children have mild disease

Health officials and scientists were investigating what was driving the increased admissions in younger ages

No paediatrics phylogenetic epidemiology yet

They would rather have a child under care for a day or two than having a child at home and complicating, ... but we really need to wait for the evidence

She said many COVID-19 patients in Gauteng reporting non-specific flu-like symptoms,

like a scratchy throat, 

as opposed to more easily identifiable markers like a loss of taste or smell

Parents and pregnant women, more hospital admissions recently,

to get tested in case intervention is needed further down the line.

Delta driving the state’s uptick in hospitalizations

I encourage everyone not to be hysterical about what we don’t know about omicron,

but to be really proactive in controlling what we do know, 

which is the delta variant is here, 

it’s with us,

it’s causing increasing trends

24.8 million first doses

23.9 million second doses

412 suspected cases of CVST   (Cerebral Sinus Vein Thrombosis) have been reported across the UK

(Only 43 suspected cases were after the second dose of AZ vaccine)

ChAdOx1 interacts with CAR and PF4 with implications for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome

https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abl8213

Vaccines derived from chimpanzee adenovirus

As part of the largest vaccination campaign in history, 

Ultra rare side effects not seen in phase 3 trials,

including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)

Adenoviruses deployed as vaccination vectors versus SARS-CoV-2 bind to platelet factor 4 (PF4), 

a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of HIT. 

heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 

Computational simulations to demonstrate an electrostatic interaction mechanism with PF4, 

which was confirmed experimentally by surface plasmon resonance. 

These data confirm that PF4 is capable of forming stable complexes with clinically relevant adenoviruses, 

an important step in unravelling the mechanisms underlying TTS.

Platelet factor 4 (PF4)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_factor_4

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41420-019-0188-0

https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/platelet-factor-4

This chemokine is released from activated platelets during platelet aggregation, and promotes blood coagulation

Also has a role in inflammation and wound repair

Prof Alan Parker, Cardiff University

The adenovirus has an extremely negative surface, and platelet factor four is extremely positive and the two things fit together quite well
 
What we have is the trigger, but there's a lot of steps that have to happen next

Recent case reports show that most patients presenting with TTS

( more than 90%) tested positive for PF4 antibodies

A ChAdOx1/PF4 complex could induce anti-PF4 autoantibodies.

In this potential mechanism, small quantities of ChAdOx1 enter the blood through minor capillary injuries 

caused by the intramuscular injection, as has previously been observed

This proposal goes some way toward explaining why TTS is observed so rarely, 

because it may require a series of low frequency stochastic interactions, 

first between small numbers of adenovirus particles entering the blood / lymph and then monocytes and / or B cells, 

which may only occur in individuals who are predisposed toward the generation of anti-PF4 antibodies.

## Omicron does reinfect after natural infection

Reinfections are probable, not good news actually

How likely somebody who has already had Covid to catch Omicron?

(catching it twice or more) 

Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection associated with emergence of the Omicron variant in South Africa 

What is already known on this topic 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.11.21266068v2.full.pdf

Prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to provide 84% reduction in infection risk
 
What this study adds 

We find no evidence of increased reinfection risk associated with circulation of Beta or Delta variants,

compared to the ancestral strain in routine epidemiological data from South Africa. 

In contrast, we find clear, population-level evidence to suggest substantial immune evasion by the Omicron variant. 

Omicron selection advantage is at least partially driven by an increased ability to infect previously infected individuals. 

Omicron variant increases reinfection risk - Yes

Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates substantial population-level evidence for evasion of immunity from prior infection. 

Retrospective analysis of routine epidemiological surveillance data 

4th March 2020 to 27th November 2021

South Africa’s National Notifiable Medical Conditions Surveillance System 

N = 2,796,982

Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2

Results

35,670 suspected reinfections were identified 

among 2,796,982 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2,

who had a positive test result at least 90 days prior to 27th November 2021

35,670 individuals with at least two infections

332 individuals with third infections

1 individual with four infection

The relative hazard ratio for wave 2 versus wave 1 was 0.75

The relative hazard ratio for wave 3 versus wave 1 was 0.71

Relative hazard ratio for the period from 01 November 2021 to 27 November 2021

The relative hazard ratio for wave 4 versus wave 1 was 2.39

In the time of beta and delta

Increases in primary infections

No corresponding increase in reinfection hazard

In the time of omicron

Omicron variant, decrease in the hazard for primary infection

Increase in reinfection hazard coefficient

Conclusion

Population-level evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection. 

In contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta variants. 

This finding has important implications for public health planning, 

particularly in countries like South Africa with high rates of immunity from prior infection. 

Urgent questions remain regarding whether Omicron is also able to evade vaccine-induced immunity,

and the potential implications on protection against severe disease and death. 

Prof Paul Hunter

The implications of this paper are that Omicron will be able to overcome natural and probably vaccine-induced immunity to a significant degree.
 
But, the degree is still unclear - though it is doubtful that this will represent complete escape.

Prof Francois Balloux, University College London

The higher estimated re-infection ability of the Omicron variant to cause re-infection is not overly surprising

and could be largely anticipated based on the large number of mutations in the spike protein carried by the omicron variant, 

which increase the Omicron variant's ability to bypass host immunity
