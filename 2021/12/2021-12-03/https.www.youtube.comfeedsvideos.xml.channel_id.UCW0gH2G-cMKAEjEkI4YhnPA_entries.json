It follows the youngest son of Beregond, Borlas - who is now an aging man.  Borlas enters into a conversation with Saelon, where they discuss a growing darkness in the world of Man.\n\nThis New Shadow - a Dark Tree - is led by a mysterious figure known as Herumor.  Combined with the disappearance of a Gondorian ship, the mystery of this new secret group, and Tolkien's brief writing, are brought to a close with a chilling end.\n\nBe sure to visit Lord of Maps to see their holiday specials, and use the code NERDOFMAPS at LordofMaps.com to save 15% on your order!\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
