Ethan Nicolle and Adam Yenser are joined by Pastor David Guzik of Enduring Word Bible commentary to help The Babylon Bee know where the lines are for Christian satire, mockery, and jokes about Hell. Pastor David is put to the test to see if he really knows the Bible like he says he does. They talk about this week at The Babylon Bee, weird news, and also question if Trump really deserves a ninth black belt in Taekwondo.

Be sure to check out David Guzik’s freely available Bible commentary at: https://enduringword.com/

Ethan, Adam, and Pastor David answer a two-for-one subscriber dare involving a meme, talk about The Bee’s Banger and Bomb of the Week, and dive into deep end of this week’s weird news. The weird news involves Canada’s strategic maple reserve, a street sweeper getaway, and a woman kicked out of a church for illicit cilantro. Pastor David is subjected to a brutal Bible trivia quiz and The Babylon Bee officially puts him on retainer to make sure all their jokes are clear with Heaven. Then there’s some salty hate mail.

In the subscriber lounge, there is a bonus better hate mail, a discussion about free will and God’s sovereignty, subscriber-submitted headlines, and The Ten Questions for Pastor David Guzik.
