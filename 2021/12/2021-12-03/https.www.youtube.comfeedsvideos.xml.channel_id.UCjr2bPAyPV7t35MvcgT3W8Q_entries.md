Bill gates has gained an incredible amount of control over the World Health Organization. But how is it possible for one billionaire to become so powerful and influential? This is a United Nations body that advises on public health policies of 194 member states. 

Bill Gates has been the richest man in the world since Windows 95 and never left the top 4 position. 

Private donations could easily introduce a conflict of interest when they could sway WHO’s policies to benefit big pharmaceutical corporations or food retailers. This is why the WHO doesn’t openly accept donations from these entities. But that’s not the policy of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In fact, with the main focus on building private-public partnerships, it is the exact opposite. 

Current models predict the vaccination rates of middle income countries won’t reach herd immunity levels sooner than 2023. Poor countries won’t reach those levels by 2024 if at all.
This situation is way worse than bad. Low income nations aren’t just failing to inoculate their most vulnerable populations. High-income economies are actually administering booster doses at a faster rate than poor countries are administering their first doses. 

When rich countries have already 2/3 of their population fully vaccinated, in poor countries, barely 3% of their total population received a second dose. Most of the low-income countries aren’t hammered just by COVID19.
