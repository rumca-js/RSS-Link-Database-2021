Today, we cover the story, creation, and abandonment of JRR Tolkien's The New Shadow - a sequel to The Lord of the Rings.  It follows the youngest son of Beregond, Borlas - who is now an aging man.  Borlas enters into a conversation with Saelon, where they discuss a growing darkness in the world of Man.

This New Shadow - a Dark Tree - is led by a mysterious figure known as Herumor.  Combined with the disappearance of a Gondorian ship, the mystery of this new secret group, and Tolkien's brief writing, are brought to a close with a chilling end.
