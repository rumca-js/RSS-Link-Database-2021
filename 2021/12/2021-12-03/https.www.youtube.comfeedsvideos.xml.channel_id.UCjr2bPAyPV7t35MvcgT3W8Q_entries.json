But how is it possible for one billionaire to become so powerful and influential? This is a United Nations body that advises on public health policies of 194 member states. \n\nBill Gates has been the richest man in the world since Windows 95 and never left the top 4 position. \n\nPrivate donations could easily introduce a conflict of interest when they could sway WHO\u2019s policies to benefit big pharmaceutical corporations or food retailers. This is why the WHO doesn\u2019t openly accept donations from these entities. But that\u2019s not the policy of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In fact, with the main focus on building private-public partnerships, it is the exact opposite. \n\nCurrent models predict the vaccination rates of middle income countries won\u2019t reach herd immunity levels sooner than 2023. Poor countries won\u2019t reach those levels by 2024 if at all.\nThis situation is way worse than bad. Low income nations aren\u2019t just failing to inoculate their most vulnerable populations. High-income economies are actually administering booster doses at a faster rate than poor countries are administering their first doses. \n\nWhen rich countries have already 2/3 of their population fully vaccinated, in poor countries, barely 3% of their total population received a second dose. Most of the low-income countries aren\u2019t hammered just by COVID19.\n\nSources\n\nVaccine Apartheid\nhttps://www.eiu.com/n/85-poor-countries-will-not-have-access-to-coronavirus-vaccines/\nPressuring low-income countries\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/world/bill-gates-vaccine-coronavirus.html\nForcing Oxford to partner with AstraZeneca\nhttps://khn.org/news/rather-than-give-away-its-covid-vaccine-oxford-makes-a-deal-with-drugmaker/\nStatistics on doses, vaccinations and cases\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations\nCentralization of vaccine manufacturing\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/us/politics/covid-vaccine-moderna-global.html\nBill Gates' influence on patenting technologies\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/162000/bill-gates-impeded-global-access-covid-vaccines\nPatents are a barrier to vaccine distribution\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-big-barriers-to-global-vaccination-patent-rights-national-self-interest-and-the-wealth-gap-153443\nForbes profile on Bill Gates\nhttps://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/\nFunding of the World Health Organization\nhttps://www.who.int/about/funding/\nhttp://open.who.int/2020-21/contributors/contributor \nhttps://www.who.int/about/accountability/budget/\nWho controls the W.H.O.\nhttps://ahrp.org/who-controls-the-who/\n\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation & Trust\nCoI investments\nhttp://healthscienceandlaw.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Public-Interest-Position.WHO_.FENSAGates.Jan2017.pdf\nFoundation's financial reports\nhttps://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/a-01_gpp_form%20990_ty20%20(for%20public%20disclosure).pdf\nhttps://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/F_151002C-1B_Bill&MelindaGatesFoundation_FS.pdf\nBiontech investment from Gates Foundation\nhttps://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/biontech-announces-new-collaboration-develop-hiv-and \nUnintended consequences of Gates Foundation grants\nhttps://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-gates16dec16-story.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/world/americas/17iht-gates.4.10120087.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html\nBill Gates - The Most Powerful Doctor\nhttps://www.politico.eu/article/bill-gates-who-most-powerful-doctor/\n\nThe cost of vaccine nationalism\nhttps://iccwbo.org/media-wall/news-speeches/study-shows-vaccine-nationalism-could-cost-rich-countries-us4-5-trillion/\n\nPfizer sees significant opportunity\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com.au/pfizer-execs-highlight-significant-opportunity-hike-covid-vaccine-price-2021-3\nPfizer silencing governments\nhttps://www.citizen.org/news/report-how-pfizer-silences-world-governments-in-vaccine-negotiations/\nhttps://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-02-23/held-to-ransom-pfizer-demands-governments-gamble-with-state-assets-to-secure-vaccine-deal\n\nN.I.H.-Moderna dispute over vaccine patents\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/us/moderna-vaccine-patent.html\n\n\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\nhttps://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x80EbmX5xys", "date_published": "2021-12-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
