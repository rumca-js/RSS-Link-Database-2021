It\u2019s called \u201cSam\u2019s Idea,\u201d because Sam Wilkes came up with the original bass riff. Then Jack took it and completely messed with it and made it virtually unrecognizable (even to Sam). But it was too late to change the name. It was, and will forever be known as \u201cSam\u2019s Idea.\u201d\n\nSave this song on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/track/2svSa3xBy6h3Liwl6t8BHf?si=600f53f2647a4c87\nFollow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/pomplamoosemusic\nBecome a patron of our music (to vote on the songs we cover and get merch and stuff like that): http://www.patreon.com/pomplamoose\n\nMUSICIAN CREDITS\nKeys: Jack Conte\nBass: Sam Wilkes\nGuitar: Ryan Lerman\nDrums: Louis Cole\n\nAUDIO CREDITS\nEngineer: Chris Sorem\nMixing/Mastering: Jack Conte\nProducer: Jack Conte\n\nVIDEO CREDITS\nPerformed by Deepraj Singh, with Emma Richardson and Rachel Zegler\nWritten, Directed & Produced by Sammy Paul\nExecutive Producers: Dom Fera & Nazim Isma Benjamin\nDP/Colorist: Jamie MacLeod\nSound Design: Dan Pugsley\nVideo Editor: Sammy Paul\nFocus Puller: Oliver Pearson Pajitra\nProduction Assistants: Myles Wheeler & Emma Simpson\nSpecial Thanks: Ryan Concannon, Jacob Trueman, Charis Entwistle, Edith Windle, Yasmine Paul Rath, Sean Rath", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jd_fGE9XtQ", "date_published": "2021-12-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
