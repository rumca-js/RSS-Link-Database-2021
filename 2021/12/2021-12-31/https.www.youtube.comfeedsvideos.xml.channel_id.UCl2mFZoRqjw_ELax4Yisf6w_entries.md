Post a message on screen http://bit.ly/postamessage Or else I will read it in the normal chat if it is not swamped. I am sorry if I miss your message, I do my best to read as much stuff as I can that is somewhat interesting even if it is a normal unpaid message, but the chat sometimes moves way too fast for me to get things.

## happy holidays everyone ☺️
