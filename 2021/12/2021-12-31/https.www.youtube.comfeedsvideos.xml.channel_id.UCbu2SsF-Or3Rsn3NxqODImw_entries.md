Despite the new generation of consoles, PC remains its own unique gaming platform that can provide experiences you might not be able to find on other systems while also offering a place to play multiplatform games at their best. PC's seemingly infinite backlog of games makes it a beast of a platform, and there's just as much to look forward to in 2022 and beyond.

It's exciting that PC gamers have options for even more powerful video cards with Nvidia's RTX 30-series and AMD's RX 6000-series (if you can find them), providing more graphical horsepower than ever before and new features like ray tracing and AI-driven supersampling. But while PC pushes innovation in graphics and performance, what matters most is the games. And if you need a cheat sheet for what's in your PC gaming future, and details on why you should be excited for each of these upcoming titles, we have you covered. Plus, if you’re looking for some of the best PC games to play right now, we've got a great list for that too.
