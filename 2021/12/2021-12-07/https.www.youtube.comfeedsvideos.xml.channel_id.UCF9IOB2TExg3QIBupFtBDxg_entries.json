VARIANT\n\nhttps://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-provide-update-omicron-variant\n\nPreliminary laboratory studies demonstrate that three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine neutralize the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 lineage),\n\nwhile two doses show significantly reduced neutralization titers\n\nData indicate that a third dose of BNT162b2 increases the neutralizing antibody titers by 25-fold compared to two doses against the Omicron variant;\n \ntiters after the booster dose are comparable to titers observed after two doses against the wild-type virus which are associated with high levels of protection\n\nAs 80% of epitopes in the spike protein recognized by CD8+ T cells are not affected by the mutations in the Omicron variant, two doses may still induce protection against severe disease\n\nThe companies continue to advance the development of a variant-specific vaccine for Omicron and expect to have it available by March\n\nin
