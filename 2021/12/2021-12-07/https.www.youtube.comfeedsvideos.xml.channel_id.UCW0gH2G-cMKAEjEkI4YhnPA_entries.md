This holiday, I'm inviting my fellow Tolkien fans to join me in donating copies of "The Hobbit" to kids in Children's hospitals, schools, or anywhere that helps kids in need! 

It can be as simple as selecting an online retailer, ordering copies of The Hobbit (I recommend the illustrated edition by Jemima Catlin for young kids), and have it sent to the hospital, school, or charity of your choice!

Fun kids gift ideas in this video are:
