Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nTom Huizenga | December 8, 2021\nIf you've been feeling a little overwhelmed with the world lately, you're not alone. Arooj Aftab is right there with you. The Brooklyn-based Pakistani musician transforms her worries into tranquil music. \"The way things have been unfolding, it's just madness,\" she told NPR recently. The songs she offers here, at a decrepit, yet generously resonant convent in Brooklyn, sound like an antidote for stressful times. Aftab's melodies float delicately and meander amid a chamber ensemble that includes Celtic harpist Maeve Gilchrist, classical guitarist Gyan Riley (yes, Terry Riley's son), violinist Darian Donovan Thomas and Shahzad Ismaily on bass and synth. And then there's Aftab's voice, smoky yet smooth, caressing words in the Urdu language.\n\nAftab inherited her native South Asian musical roots and then replanted them on U.S. soil, studying jazz at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. While her interests in music are broad \u2013 ambient, minimalism, reggae \u2013 her style is distinctively her own. \"After all these years, those things have all come together and are holding hands, a statement to someone who has roots in multiple places,\" she told NPR.\n\nThese songs are from Vulture Prince, which landed in the top 10 of NPR Music's best albums of 2021. \"Suroor,\" with its propulsive groove, speaks of the intoxicating nature of love (\"It has made me a drunk, you being the drink\"), while \"Mohabbat,\" as its polar opposite, features Aftab's elastic embellishments, lamenting over lost love. \"Saans Lo\" is solemn, like a prayer. \"Breathe,\" Aftab sings, \"gather the scattered pieces of your heart.\" This is surely one of the most beautifully rendered Tiny Desk performances.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Suroor\"\n\"Mohabbat\"\n\"Saans Lo\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nArooj Aftab: vocals\nDarian Donovan Thomas: violin\nShahzad Ismaily: bass, synth\nGyan Riley: guitar\nMaeve Gilchrist: harp\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Sofian J.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nSofie Hernandez-Simeonidis | December 7, 2021\nStepping into a DMV when you're about to take your first driver's test, while nerve wracking, is something of a milestone. And Olivia Rodrigo has been hitting milestones with frequency this year: her first album SOUR debuted at the top of the charts in May after the success of three previously released singles, most notably the viral \"drivers license\" (hence the DMV locale and its \"interesting vibes.\") Her pop stardom may seem sudden, but Rodrigo has been entranced by music and songwriting for the majority of her 18 years, as if she's been observing the right moves from the backseat of the car until it was time for her to get behind the wheel.\n\nRodrigo and her band take on the Tiny Desk mentality as they experiment with arrangements throughout this performance, embracing new sounds for her songs. The set begins with an acoustic version of the pop-punk-ish single \"good 4 u,\" and a similar setup continues with the addition of an echoey, electric guitar in \"traitor.\" \"drivers license\" features only Rodrigo and her keyboard, a shift from the recorded version well-known for Dan Nigro's production and the ever-present beeping of a car door sensor. \"deja vu\" starts softly with just an acoustic guitar until the chorus ramps up to a full band after she exclaims, \"Do you get deja vu, huh?\"\n\nSOUR tells the story of a first heartbreak, one that inspires an intense anguish most accessible when you're a teenager. That open wound, empty-chest feeling of a breakup, especially when you're as young as Rodrigo, is difficult to shake. The album allowed listeners to bask in Rodrigo's heartache as if it were their own, but as she dances around an empty DMV and laughs along to a song about betrayal, she proves that time heals all wounds.\n\nSET LIST\n\"good 4 u\"\n\"traitor\"\n\"drivers license\"\n\"deja vu\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nOlivia Rodrigo \u2013 vocals, guitar, keys\nHeather Baker - guitars\nHayley Brownell - drums, guitars\nArianna Powell - guitars\nMoa Munoz - bass, guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: David Clair, Joe McGarry\nAudio: Paul Hager\nAP: Derek Griesbach\nDirector of Photography: Matthias Schubert\nCamera Operator: Stephen St. Peter\nGaffer: Joe Escandell\nColor: Henry Santos\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #oliviarodrigo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGczofguB0c", "date_published": "2021-12-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
