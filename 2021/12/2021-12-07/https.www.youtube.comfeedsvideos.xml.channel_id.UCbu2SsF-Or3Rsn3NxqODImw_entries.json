Although it is on the way, no official dates were announced but it\u2019s said that it won't surface \"in the next six months.\"\n\nThere were also reports of the next game in the Battlefield franchise to be even more like an Overwatch-Styled shooter and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla getting another story expansion. However, this new expansion could be the biggest yet with 40 hours of additional content.\n\nLater in the video, Persia goes over Ubisoft Quartz - Ubisoft\u2019s first dive into the NFT market. Quartz will wrap up in-game cosmetics into their own NFT's, each of which will have a unique serial number and history of owners. The Quartz Beta is only currently supported by Ghost Recon: Breakpoint on PC, and is only available in certain regions despite using a decentralized blockchain called Tezos which leads Ubisoft to call its venture \"energy-efficient\". In case you didn\u2019t know, it can cost an extreme amount of energy to produce an NFT and comes with a major cost to the environment which may be why Ubisoft is stressing the energy-efficient angle of Tezos.\n\nLastly, Persia goes over the most recent teaser for the Halo TV show that is set to launch on Paramount+ in 2022.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgqcCYob9W8", "date_published": "2021-12-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Warzone New Pacific Map Livestream", "description": "Verdansk is gone and Caldera is here!

The latest game by DICE may have had a very rocky and buggy launch, but that\u2019s an even better reason to test the limits of specialists, gadgets, and some wonky physics. While you\u2019re waiting for some massive patches to come in with more than 150 fixes, join us as we have some fun with the game\u2019s brokenness.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to see if you can be killed by a flying decapitated tank turret, if you can break your fall by grappling the ground, if anything can pierce Dozer\u2019s shield, and what Irish\u2019s grenade and rocket interceptor actually stops. We\u2019re also going to show you how to stop those overpowered hovercraft, see if smoke can save you from Paik\u2019s scan, try to revive through floors, and mess with some explosives. We\u2019d love to do even more tests, so tell us what you would like us to try with specialists, gadgets, guns, or physics.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 is out now on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC.
