In today’s GameSpot News, Persia goes over reports of a battle royale mode that might be coming to Battlefield 2042 soon, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla getting a possible god-of-war styled expansion and more.

A battle royale mode for Battlefield 2042 is said to be arriving "in the very near future” according to longtime games journalist, Tom Henderson. Although it is on the way, no official dates were announced but it’s said that it won't surface "in the next six months."

There were also reports of the next game in the Battlefield franchise to be even more like an Overwatch-Styled shooter and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla getting another story expansion. However, this new expansion could be the biggest yet with 40 hours of additional content.

Later in the video, Persia goes over Ubisoft Quartz - Ubisoft’s first dive into the NFT market. Quartz will wrap up in-game cosmetics into their own NFT's, each of which will have a unique serial number and history of owners. The Quartz Beta is only currently supported by Ghost Recon: Breakpoint on PC, and is only available in certain regions despite using a decentralized blockchain called Tezos which leads Ubisoft to call its venture "energy-efficient". In case you didn’t know, it can cost an extreme amount of energy to produce an NFT and comes with a major cost to the environment which may be why Ubisoft is stressing the energy-efficient angle of Tezos.

Lastly, Persia goes over the most recent teaser for the Halo TV show that is set to launch on Paramount+ in 2022.

In this video we break down everything you can still do in Brilliant Diamond & Shiny Pearl after you defeat the Elite Four and roll credits on the game for the first time. 

Pokemon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl might have a different endgame than their Gen 4 counterparts, but there is still a lot to do. Some like the Stark Mountain quest will be familiar to veterans of Diamond & Pearl, but new additions like the Underground area and Ramanas Park are worth an extra look at. There are also quite a few easter eggs like obtaining the sounds of the original Gen 4 games!

In this video we break down 7 key things you can do as soon as you are crowned champion from taking part in Super Contests and making Poffins, to taking your best battle team into the Battle Tower to properly min/max your Pokemon to the best of your ability.

Battlefield 2042 specialists aren’t very popular, but that doesn’t mean we can’t push them to the limit. In this video, we’re testing unexpected physics, seeing if even more things can pierce Dozer’s shield, learning Ranger is no good boy, and messing with guns, rockets, and explosives.

Welcome back to more Battlefield 2042 mythbusting. The latest game by DICE may have had a very rocky and buggy launch, but that’s an even better reason to test the limits of specialists, gadgets, and some wonky physics. While you’re waiting for some massive patches to come in with more than 150 fixes, join us as we have some fun with the game’s brokenness.

In this video, we’re going to see if you can be killed by a flying decapitated tank turret, if you can break your fall by grappling the ground, if anything can pierce Dozer’s shield, and what Irish’s grenade and rocket interceptor actually stops. We’re also going to show you how to stop those overpowered hovercraft, see if smoke can save you from Paik’s scan, try to revive through floors, and mess with some explosives. We’d love to do even more tests, so tell us what you would like us to try with specialists, gadgets, guns, or physics. 

Battlefield 2042 is out now on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC. Make sure to head on over to GameSpot.com and stay here on youtube.com/gamespot for ongoing coverage, including Season 1 starting in 2022, the new Exposure map, and a recent DICE shakeup putting Titanfall/Apex Boss Vince Zampella in charge.
