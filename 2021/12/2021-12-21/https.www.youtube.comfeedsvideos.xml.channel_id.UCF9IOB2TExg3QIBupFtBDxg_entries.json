happen\n\nThe grim predictions were highly unlikely\n\nThere is a range of scenarios, \n\nof course the number of Omicron cases will increase.\n\nIt's highly infectious. \n\nBut the indications are that it is not as severe and our hospitals, \n\nin NSW and Victoria, have been coping extremely well\n\nProfessor Paul Kelly, Australia chief medical officer\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10333919/Coronavirus-Australia-Australias-Chief-Medical-Officer-hits-doomsday-Omicron-predictions.html\n\nselective and misleading media reporting about ongoing modelling\n\nthe predicted hospitalisation estimations are unlikely.\n\nEvidence about the characteristics of Omicron is still emerging but early trends seen both internationally and within Australia suggest that it is more transmissible\n\nHowever, early indications around hospitalisation, ICU admission and death show that Omicron could be far less than Delta and other variants \n\nImportantly, after almost four weeks of Omicron in Australia there are currently no confirmed Omicron cases in ICU and no deaths confirmed to date\n\nModelling, it's one of a range of tools and can't be viewed in isolation\n\nA preliminary scenario, of many being considered to help inform decision making\n\nPresents one of the worst case of all potential scenarios\n\nincluding assumptions that the Omicron variant is as severe as the Delta variant, \n\nan absence of hospital surge capacity, \n\na highly limited booster program, \n\nno change to baseline public health and social measures\n\nand an absence of spontaneous behaviour change in the face of rising case numbers\n\nNone of these five assumptions represent the likely state of events, let alone all of them together, \n\ntherefore presenting that scenario as the likely scenario that will occur is highly misleading\n\nFormer deputy chief health officer Nick Coatsworth \n\nWhoever leaked the Doherty modelling

medicine for the individual patient to be empowered or should professionals retain control?\n\nIs it important that patients understand their health and how to promote health, or should we just rely on doctors to heal us when we get sick?\n\nIs there a risk of promoting \u2018medical dependency\u2019?\n\nIs there a difference between compliance and concordance?\n\nDo people need a level of knowledge and understanding in order to make informed decisions about their health?\n\nIs there a risk for medicine to medicalise?\n\nCan some diseases be prevented?
