Compared to the total daily water consumption of 1,218 billion liters, that\u2019s less than 0.14%. Sounds like a negligible amount. Until it\u2019s not. \n\nBecause the reality is, only one third of data center operators are measuring their water consumption. And the water that gets measured is only the one used directly for cooling. But there is a much bigger hidden cost to running a data center than that.\n\nSources\n\nData center water consumption\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41545-021-00101-w\nhttps://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/data-center-water-usage-remains-hidden/\nWater used on cooling vs electricity generation\nhttps://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/opinions/an-industry-in-transition-1-data-center-water-use/\nArizona, Texas and Google\nhttps://time.com/5814276/google-data-centers-water/ \nData centers water impact on dry regions\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/drought-stricken-communities-push-back-against-data-centers-n1271344\nArizona water concerns over data centers\nhttps://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/huge-data-center-moves-forward-in-mesa-despite-arizona-water-concerns/\nData center tax breaks\nhttps://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/arizona-passes-data-center-tax-breaks/\nApple in Arizona\nhttps://appleinsider.com/articles/17/05/10/apple-plans-major-expansions-at-arizona-and-nevada-data-centers\nhttps://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/mesa-council-approves-1bn-google-arizona-data-center-16m-tax-breaks/\nChandler, Arizona\nhttps://azcentral.com/story/news/local/chandler/2021/11/22/chandler-wants-ban-more-data-centers-after-years-complaints/8627569002/\nOregon\nhttps://apnews.com/article/technology-business-the-dalles-oregon-droughts-62b3774442293497ceb2306a606471af \nhttps://apnews.com/article/technology-business-environment-and-nature-oregon-united-states-2385c62f1a87030d344261ef9c76ccda\nSouth Carolina\nhttps://www.postandcourier.com/news/google-s-controversial-groundwater-withdrawal-sparks-question-of-who-owns/article_bed9179c-1baa-11e7-983e-03d6b33a01e7.html\nhttps://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/after-aquifer-concerns-googles-600m-south-carolina-expansion-finds-new-water-supply/\n\n\nLake Mead Depleting\nhttps://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/06/10/lake-mead-water-lowest-hoover-dam-built-colorado-river-shortage/7640437002/\n\nWestern U.S. drought\nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2020/05/06/western-megadrought-centuries-worsened-climate-change-global-warming/3036460001/\nWater shortages in US West\nhttps://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-04-20/us-west-prepares-for-possible-1st-water-shortage-declaration\nColorado River Declining\nhttps://morrisoninstitute.asu.edu/sites/default/files/the_myth_of_safe-yield_0.pdf\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/punishing-heat-west-could-smash-records-experts-sound-alarm-wildfire-n1270696\n\nGrowing Internet demands\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/dam/m/en_us/solutions/service-provider/vni-forecast-highlights/pdf/Middle_East_and_Africa_2021_Forecast_Highlights.pdf\nGrowth of HyperScale Data Centers\nhttps://www.srgresearch.com/articles/microsoft-amazon-and-google-account-for-over-half-of-todays-600-hyperscale-data-centers\n\nData center locations (USA)\nhttps://www.datacentermap.com/usa/\n\nData Center Energy Consumption\nhttps://www.nrdc.org/resources/americas-data-centers-consuming-and-wasting-growing-amounts-energy\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/business/global/20green.html\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/global-warming-data-centres-to-consume-three-times-as-much-energy-in-next-decade-experts-warn-a6830086.html\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/data-centers-not-devouring-planet-electricity-yet/\nEfficiency improvement\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abfba1\n\n\nMicrosoft Underwater Data Center\nhttps://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/project-natick-underwater-datacenter/\nhttps://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/microsoft-brings-sea-to-servers-with-two-phase-liquid-immersion-cooling/\n\nReplenishing 120% water consumed by data enters\nhttps://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/09/21/microsoft-will-replenish-more-water-than-it-consumes-by-2030/\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22665445/google-water-conservation-goal-drought-data-centers\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo7V4PPHijs", "date_published": "2021-12-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
