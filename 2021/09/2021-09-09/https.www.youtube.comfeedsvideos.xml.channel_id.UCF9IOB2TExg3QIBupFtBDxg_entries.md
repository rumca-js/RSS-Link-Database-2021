COVID cases no longer climbing as feared, except Scotland 

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-cases-no-longer-climbing-as-feared

https://covid.joinzoe.com/data#levels-over-time

Data from 21st August to 4th September 

COVID cases no longer climbing as feared

Current cases, + 51,876 (symptomatic) 

Based on PCR and LFT test data from up to five days ago, n = 31,075

Down 9.2% from 57,158 new daily cases last week

In the fully vaccinated population

Cases, + 17,674 (symptomatic)

(Last week’s average, + 17,342)

New cases are the highest among the 0-18 and 18–35 year-old

On average 1 in 90 people in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID

UK R value = 1.0

Wales, 1.1

Scotland, 1.1

Scotland and England

Cases remain highest in 0-19 years old

Longer covid

894 people a day will go on to experience symptoms for longer than 12 weeks

Professor Tim Spector

It’s great to see the return to schools and summer festivals haven’t yet resulted in a spike in cases as feared. 

Worse in Scotland, rates are still rising

Scottish hospitals could soon be overwhelmed

The Scottish situation makes it clear we can’t be complacent about COVID as winter approaches

We are still producing far too many Long Covid cases and hospitalisations unnecessarily

For 521 days, ZOE and King’s College London have demanded cold and flu-like symptoms be recognised as common COVID-19 symptoms

UK rates the highest in Europe, if the government continues with no restrictions, 

surely we should at least help people to recognise the symptoms early and know when to stay at home

US vaccine mandates, All businesses with more than 100 employees

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vaccine-mandate-federal-employees/2021/09/09/1c1ce9dc-116b-11ec-882f-2dd15a067dc4_story.html

80 million workers

Up to $14,000 per violation

Immunized or face weekly testing

Signed an executive order compelling all federal employees to get vaccinated

(no testing op out)

All staffers in Head Start programs

Defense Department

Federally operated schools for Native Americans

We’re in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while

What makes it incredibly more frustrating is we have the tools to combat covid-19, 

and a distinct minority of Americans, supported by a distinct minority of elected officials, are keeping us from turning the corner

We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin

And your refusal has cost all of us

These ‘pandemic politics,’ as I refer to it, are making people sick, causing unvaccinated people to die

We cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting a large majority of Americans who have done their part

Right now local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic, 

while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs

UK, 49% for mandating

40% against

US, The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research

59% of remote workers favor vaccine requirements in their own workplaces

47% of those who are currently working in person

Burden and characteristics of COVID-19 in the United States during 2020

Columbia University and NIH, Director Francis S. Collins, Nature

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34438440/#affiliation-3

United States, 2020, highest numbers of reported cases and deaths

In the light of later antibody studies

March 11.3%

December, 24.5%

Population susceptibility at year's end was 69.0%

So, 31% of population had been exposed

(100 million people)

Prevalence rates rose above 0.8% by end of 2020

As high as 2.4% in some major metropolitan areas

Infection fatality rate fell to 0.3% by end of 2020


 

https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/

As of September 2

5,049,465 children have tested positive

252,000 cases were added the past week

Largest number of child cases in a week ever

Since the pandemic began, children, 15.1% of total cumulated cases

Week ending September 2nd, 26.8% of reported weekly COVID-19 cases

2,400 children were hospitalized nationwide (highest in pandemic)

Hospitalizations (24 states and NYC reported)

Children ranged from 1.6%-4.1% of total cumulated hospitalizations

0.1%-1.9% of all their child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization

Mortality (45 states)

Children were 0.00%-0.27% of all COVID-19 deaths

(7 states reported zero child deaths)

0.00%-0.03% of all child COVID-19 cases resulted in death

Vaccination in children

Half of children ages 12 to 15 have received at least one vaccine dose

58 percent for 16- and 17-year-olds

Anthony Fauci, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

We’ve got to get the school system masked, 

in addition to surrounding the children with vaccinated people

That’s the solution

Los Angeles mandates today

Soon mandate vaccination for school attendance

600,000 would have to get their first shot by Oct. 3

Second shot by the end of October

(LA counts since last month)

Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca chief executive on Booster doses

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/09/07/covid-booster-jab-campaign-may-not-needed-says-astra-boss/

UK is still "a few weeks away" from being able to decide

Moving too quickly to boost across the entire adult population will deprive us of these insights,

leaving this important decision to rest on limited data

NHS resource implications

Nadhim Zahawi 

NHS is ‘ready to go’ 

Philip Dormitzer, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer

Encouraged booster shots

Dismissed criticism that his company should have produced a more potent vaccine

Professor Sarah Gilbert

https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/creator-oxford-vaccine-sarah-gilbert-warns-vulnerable-will-have-shield-covid-19-cases-rise-1096315

UK, 3.8 million people classed as clinically extremely vulnerable

In people who have been vaccinated and have had the two doses, 

they will be well protected against disease that is severe enough to put them in hospital and against death

And there are unfortunately some people with particular health conditions that mean they just don’t respond to a vaccine

and they are going to have to make sure that they are protected, probably by shielding again, 

if there is a lot of spread of the virus


 



https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19

we are advising clinically extremely vulnerable people, as a minimum, to follow the same guidance as everyone else

you may wish to think particularly carefully about additional precautions you might wish to continue to take


Sweden

Removing all remaining restrictions by the end of this month

Vietnam
