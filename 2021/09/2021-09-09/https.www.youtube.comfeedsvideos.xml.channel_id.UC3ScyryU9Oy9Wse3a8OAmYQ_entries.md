From the investigative team behind FRONTLINE’s award-winning “Money, Power & Wall Street,” comes the definitive history of domestic surveillance in a post-9/11 world. In part one of this two part series, FRONTLINE filmmaker Michael Kirk pieces together the secret political history of “The Program,” which began in the wake of Sept. 11 and continues today — even after the revelations of its existence by Edward Snowden.
