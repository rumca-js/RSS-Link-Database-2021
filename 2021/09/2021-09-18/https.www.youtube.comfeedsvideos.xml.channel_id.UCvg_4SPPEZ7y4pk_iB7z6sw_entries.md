Yeah, this is the big one. Biggest leak I’ve seen in all my years, I tell you h’wat.

So enjoy my pseudo E3 presentation, lacking the professionalism in exchange for good old fashioned American GIRTH.

Gotta give credit to Ighor July for discovering the list in the first place. You can see how he did it here:

Not every title is a “new game”, likely many projects are simply older titles that were already released, or cancelled.

But, many are definitely real, and releasing within the next few years.

Here's the GitHub list, you can check for yourself if anything you're interested in appears here:
