Sedgwick has 'planted' the poster board advertising the show in which it's to be screened - as well as, probably, the Afro-Caribbean man whose presence in Edwardian Lancashire so surprises us. And he is choreographing, right before our eyes, the procession of colliers for the camera.\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality. Here is the process:\n\n1. Footage stabilization and noise/dust/scratches removal with After Effects and Neat Video \u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd17 https://www.neatvideo.com/?linkID=p7845\n2. Restoration with DeepRemaster, removing scratches and film damage \u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd17 https://github.com/satoshiiizuka/siggraphasia2019_remastering\n3. Frame interpolation to get smooth look using DAIN method. Result is 60 FPS video \u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd17 https://github.com/baowenbo/DAIN\n4. Colorization using DeOldify with NoGAN. Colors are not accurate, only for ambient mood \u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd17 https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify\n5. Upscaling using Topaz Video Enhance AI, upscale preserving detail and reducing noise \u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd17 https://topazlabs.com/video-enhance-ai/ref/755/\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 15% DISCOUNT CODE: oldendays15\n6.
