Chrome, Firefox, Edge, all have access to it, even good old Internet Explorer.\n \nWith everything going on the internet, like the collection of data on anything you do, and the aggregation of this data into big, comprehensive user profiles, that are made accessible for advertisers to serve you targeted ads, it\u2019s understandable that users would want to find a more private way of browsing.\n\nThe issue here is that \u201cIncognito\u201d mode does not prevent data collection at all. Let\u2019s see what it really does.\n\nWhat does \u201cPrivate browsing\u201d or \u201cincognito\u201d mode do?\n\nIncognito mode, does not, in fact, make you \u201cincognito\u201d nor invisible on your device. Unfortunately, your identity or activity is still clearly visible by the websites you\u2019re browsing. Your internet service providers, or the company at which you work if you\u2019re browsing on a work device, can still know what websites you\u2019ve accessed.\n\nWhat \u201cPrivate browsing\u201d and \u201cincognito mode\u201d does, is browsing without saving cookies and browsing history on your computer or phone. Your browsing session just won\u2019t store anything on your device, unless you explicitly download a file.\n\n\nHow Startpage can help\n      \nThe first step is to use a safer search engine.\n\nStartpage has a multi step process to anonymize your search query. When you hit \u201cEnter\u201d after you\u2019ve typed your query, it goes through 2 filters:\n   \nThe first one are the Premise servers. They\u2019re owned by Startpage, and they remove IP addresses and other personal information. They also anonymize any additional fields that might help you be identified by a third party.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, the query is passed on to the cloud servers, which are responsible for obtaining the search results. They call on Google, for example, to get the results, and populate the webpage before displaying it to you.\n\nThis method ensures no personal data from your search could be used to identify you. As a result, your search queries are not tailored to what you like, or dislike online, they\u2019re just the purest form of answer to what you\u2019ve been searching for. No filter bubble here.\n\nThis is extremely safe, since all personal information is destroyed immediately after being stripped from your query by the premise servers. \n      \nAnonymous view\n\u201cAnonymous View\u201d demo Anonymous view is a Startpage only feature. You can notice it right next to all search results. What it does, is allow you to browse an entire website without it knowing where you come from, or who you are.\n\nThe website will only see Startpage\u2019s IP address instead of yours, and information about your location is changed. Your language will always appear as English to the website, and your clock will show the time as UTC. Even your browser and operating system are hidden, so the company can\u2019t track that, or adjust how the site looks, or even the prices of their products.\n\n\u201cAnonymous View\u201d also lets you avoid fingerprinting, which is a way for websites to establish a unique fingerprint from your time zone, location, Ip address, and browser and OS information.\n\n# How is that different than a VPN    \nYou might think \u201cAnonymous View\u201d is a form of one-time VPN, which it kinda is, but it has advantages over a system-wide VPN.\n\nA VPN can\u2019t protect you from browser or device fingerprinting. These techniques use Javascript, and Javascript has access to some browser or device information, regardless of the fact that you use a VPN or not. Startpage\u2019s \u201cAnonymous View\u201d passes false values to the various scripts, which stops them from being able to establish a fingerprint.\n\n\nThis video is sponsored by Startpage.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZIzf5ucJ0U", "date_published": "2021-09-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
