LYRICS
Well I don't know why I came here tonight.
I've got the feeling that something ain't right.
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair,
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs.
Clowns to the left of me!
Jokers to the right!
Here I am stuck in the middle with you.
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you,
And I'm wondering what it is I should do.
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face.
Losing control and running all over the place.
Clowns to the left of me!
Jokers to the right!
Here I am stuck in the middle with you.

When you started off with nothing
And you're proud that your a self-made man.
And your friends they all come crawling,
Slap you on the back and say
Please . . .
Please . . .

Trying to make some sense of it all
But I see it makes no sense at all.
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?
I don't think that I can take anymore.
Clowns to the left of me!
Jokers to the right!
Here I am stuck in the middle with you.

When you started off with nothing
And you're proud that your a self-made man.
Ooooo-ooo-oooh
And your friends they all come crawling,
Slap you on the back and say
Please . . .
Please . . .

Well I don't know why I came here tonight.
I've got the feeling that something ain't right.
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair,
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs.
Clowns to the left of me!
Jokers to the right!
Her I am stuck in the middle with you.
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you . . .
