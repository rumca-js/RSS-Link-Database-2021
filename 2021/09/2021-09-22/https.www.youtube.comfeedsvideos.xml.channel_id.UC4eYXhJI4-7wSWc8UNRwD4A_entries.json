She opens with a short and simple rendition of the soon-to-be-released \"Maybe Baby\" before dropping her instrument and transitioning to an up-tempo, vocal-driven performance of \"Yours.\" Picking the electric guitar back up, she strums along with a steady percussion and accompanying guitars for a soulful premiere of brand-new track \"Descifrar,\" emanating an understated and consistent confidence fitting for a pop reina on the rise. She closes out the set with a full-bodied execution of \"T\u00fa,\" showcasing her signature tropicalia-meets-dream pop sound.\n\nmaye's effortless sashay from English to Spanish in her songs and speech represent an important facet of the El Tiny audience. Featuring a whole crew of Venezuelan-Americans, including her famous Latin singer-songwriter pap\u00e1, Fernando Osorio on the traditional Venezuelan cuatro, the third performance in our Hispanic Heritage Month series authentically represents the experience of a family like maye's \u2014 one that exists in both planes, two worlds.\n\nGiven a moment and a platform like this, maye seizes the opportunity and creates an alternate universe, where barriers of culture and language dissolve and areperias sparkle.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Maybe Baby\"\n\"Yours\"\n\"Descifrar\"\n\"T\u00fa\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nmaye: vocals, guitar\nAna Osorio: vocals, shakers\nOriana Aravena: guitar\nFernando Osorio: cuatro, vocals\nPatrick Howard: drums\nFernando Belisario: keys\nGuillermo Belisario: bass\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Fernando Manuel, Carlos Reyes, Alexandra A\u00f1ez\nAudio: Andr\u00e9s Daza, Spencer Ford, Patrick Howard\nB-Cam Operator: Jose Trujillo\nAC: Alejandro Villegas\n2nd AC: Lewis Reif\nGaffer: Michaelangelo Arizmendi\nGrip: Alejandro Dom\u00ednguez\nArt Direction: Alexandra A\u00f1ez\nProduction Assistants: Nathalie Chybik, Nicole Buitrago, Zelmira Rizo-Patron, Antonio Marval, Andr\u00e9s Osorio\nSpecial Thanks: Pink Poetry, LLC Electric Air Studios, Talk Shop Studios, Underdog Inc, Retro Nomad Productions, EO Entertainment and Rafael Urbina\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAlt.Latino 'El Tiny' Team: Felix Contreras, Reanna Cruz, Ana\u00efs Laurent, Stefanie Fernandez\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #eltiny #maye", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nkWKhcG-Zg", "date_published": "2021-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
