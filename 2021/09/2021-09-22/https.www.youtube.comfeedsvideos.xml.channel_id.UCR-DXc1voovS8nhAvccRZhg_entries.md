I've been testing two Raspberry Pi KVM over IP devices: The TinyPilot Voyager and the PiKVM v3. What do they do? How well do they do it? Find out how you can get complete control over any PC or Mac over a network, and which of these devices you should pick to do it.

PiKVM v3 Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mdevaev/pikvm-v3-hat

UPDATE: The PiKVM Kickstarter is over; the HAT should hopefully be available soon on PiShop.us: https://www.pishop.us/product/pikvm-v3-hat-for-raspberry-pi-4/
