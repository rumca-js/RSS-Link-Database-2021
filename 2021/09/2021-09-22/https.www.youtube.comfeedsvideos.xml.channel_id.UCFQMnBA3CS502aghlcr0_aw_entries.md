Yes it requires surgery, and no he's not a doctor, and YES it's probably my favorite episode of Shark Tank. The absolute chaos of it all.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
