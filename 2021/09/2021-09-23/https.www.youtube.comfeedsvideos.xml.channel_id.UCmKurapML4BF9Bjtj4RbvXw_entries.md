Story Behind the Music: 
This is Track #1 on our new ALBUM ‚ÄúLULLABY‚Äù. They say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This album‚Äôs journey of a thousand notes began with a single notion. 

What if ‚ÄúEye of the Tiger‚Äù was a lullaby? We often hear from beautiful people such as yourself that much of our music can be used as a sleep aid. ‚ÄúCounting sheep 2.0‚Äù -- a symphonic prescription for insomnia. In fact, one of our favorite emails of all time was from a brave navy man who served on a submarine. In his letter he talked about his struggle with claustrophobia. Can you imagine? He said he couldn‚Äôt get to sleep at night in his shoebox-sized space...until he found our music. Every night he‚Äôd don his headphones, hit play and then close his eyes. He said our music would transport him to a place where there was plenty of room for peace of mind. He could finally fall asleep.

Stories like this made us want to compose a whole album full of musical melatonin. But not just any old lullabies -- with clich√© melodies and icky toy music box sounds. We wanted to go all out (as we like to do). We wanted to rewrite household ‚Äúhits‚Äù with a thoughtful lullaby filter to see if they could stand up to helping people like you lie down.

The result of such an endeavor starts with this tune you‚Äôre watching now and will be fully released in October! The album is called ‚ÄúLULLABY‚Äù and it is dedicated to our friend, the courageous claustrophobic serviceman; to you parents who tirelessly, and often sleeplessly, love your children into becoming their best selves, praying for them as they sleep; AND to you insomniacs out there whose creative minds refuse to turn off at night. We know how that feels. 

We hope you‚Äôll support us and buy (or stream) this album and make it part of your nightly routine -- a soundtrack to sleep by! Thank you from the bottom of our feather pillows for listening to our music, watching our videos and for supporting us. Without you all our dreams would still be asleep.üò¥

Love, The Piano Guys
