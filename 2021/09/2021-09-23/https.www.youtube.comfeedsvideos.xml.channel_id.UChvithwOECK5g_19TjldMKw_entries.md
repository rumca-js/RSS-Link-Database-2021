Mattias Daly, a long time student of Chinese medicine, talks about his experience in China as a university student, and how the training and degrees that get handed out to allow practice in the USA could be fraudulent. Not only that, but how the CCP may be using traditional Chinese medicine to infiltrate and interface with American law makers.
