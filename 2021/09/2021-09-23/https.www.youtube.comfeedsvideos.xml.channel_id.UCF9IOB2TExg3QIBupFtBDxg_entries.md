111 calls for respiratory-type indicators increased nationally

Particularly, 1-14 years

Also, potential covid-19 assessments, 5-14 year olds 

Common colds are caused by:

100 different rhinoviruses

Respiratory syncytial virus 

Adenoviruses

Four types of coronavirus

Influenza 

Parainfluenza 

Dr Gary Howsam, vice-chair of the Royal College of GPs

we are starting to see a major resurgence of illnesses like common colds, flu and stomach bugs, 

alongside the Covid-19 virus in the community

Symptoms of Covid-19 can often be similar to symptoms of other illnesses such as the common cold. 

So it’s important that if a patient does experience symptoms of Covid-19, 

such as a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or a loss or change to sense of smell or taste that they get a PCR test immediately, 

and on receiving a positive result, self-isolate for the required period of time

Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England

Hand washing, ventilation and mask wearing aren’t only important for Covid-19,

they keep other bugs at bay too 

Do I have COVID or a cold?

Vaccinated or not

Anosmia is one of the most important predictors of testing positive for COVID-19 rather than a regular cold

If fully vaccinated (as of 21st September)

Runny nose

Headache

Sneezing

Sore throat

Anamosa

If unvaccinated

Headache

Runny nose

Sore throat

Fever

Persistent cough

Anosmia

Other symptoms

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/the-20-symptoms-of-covid-19-to-watch-out-for

Chills or shivers

Loss or change of taste

Fatigue

Delirium

Skin rash

Changes in mouth or tongue

Red and sore fingers or toes

Shortness of breath

Chest pain

Muscle pain

Hoarse voice

Diarrhoea

Anorexia

Abdominal pains

If you feel newly unwell, especially if you’re suffering from any of the common covid symptoms, stay home and get a COVID test, even if you’ve been vaccinated. 

Lateral flow test

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-analysis-of-lateral-flow-tests-shows-specificity-of-at-least-999

99.9% specificity

May be 99.97%

Low false positive rate

A negative result from a lateral flow test is not totally reliable

High false negative rate

https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/feature/how-reliable-are-lateral-flow-covid-19-tests

72% picked up in those with symptoms

58% picked up in those without symptoms

So if your symptoms persist it’s best to get a PCR test
