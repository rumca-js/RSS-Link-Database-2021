## Call of Duty: Vanguard Beta vs Modern Warfare

Call of Duty: Vanguard feels like a hybrid between Modern Warfare 2019 and Call of Duty: WW2. It has many of Modern Warfare’s advances like gun customization and adds some flavor to maps by way of limited destruction. But Vanguard also falls behind Modern Warfare in a few key areas. Let’s talk about where Vanguard stacks up to recent Call Of Duty games and how it might compete this year with other AAA shooters like Battlefield. 

Call of Duty: Vanguard, being developed by Sledgehammer Games, is the next title following Black Ops - Cold War. Unlike Cold War, Vanguard runs on a modified engine used for Modern Warfare 2019. As we played through the recent Vanguard beta, we couldn't help but notice the major similarities, and important differences, between Vanguard and Modern Warfare. 

In this video, we’re going to take a look at the Vanguard Beta from a Modern Warfare perspective and analyze how, in some cases, Vanguard feels like a reskinned version of 2019's title. For many fans, Modern Warfare took the COD franchise in a completely new direction, with its porous open maps, tactically inspired weapon handling, and heavy gun customization. Modern Warfare also introduced the now free-to-play battle royale game Warzone. Vanguard appears to expand on Modern Warfare's Gunsmith menu and adds some new features like limited environmental destruction, movable objectives, a reworked minimap, and the ability to choose the "combat pacing" which varies the number of players and the kinds of matches you play with others. However, Vanguard takes steps back toward classic Call of Duty map design with smaller three-lane layouts, easier-to-handle weapons, and familiar killstreaks. 

We don’t know much yet about the new Warzone map coming with the launch of Vanguard, but we do know the transition between multiplayer and battle royale will be much smoother than in past series entries, with Vanguard sporting many of the same mechanics as Modern Warfare. Call Of Duty: Vanguard is set to launch on November 5, now two weeks before the delayed Battlefield 2042.
