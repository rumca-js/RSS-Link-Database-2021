With the Inspiration4 mission in the books, hot on the heels of Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic launching their first crewed missions, we've seen a bit of a backlash against this new space race. So today I just wanted to share my opinion on why space travel is important and the framing we've seen around these flights and these companies is misguided.

All opinions are mine (as of this recording anyway). Disagreements welcome.
