I spent a few days in Breckenridge, Colorado with the folks at Rivian and their new R1T electric truck. I drove the vehicle extensively on the highway, in canyons, on dirt/gravel roads, and even up some pretty aggressive rock crawling trails. I have a lot of thoughts: from a tour of the exterior/cabin to my thoughts on the driving dynamics, vehicle functions, user interface design, ADAS Driver+ system and more, this is a video you won't want to miss if you're interested in the incoming electric truck!
