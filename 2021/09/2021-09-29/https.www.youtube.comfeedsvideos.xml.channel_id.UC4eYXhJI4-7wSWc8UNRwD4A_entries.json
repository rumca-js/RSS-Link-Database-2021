So much of her history and music is centered around the Afro-Cuban spiritual practice that some know as santer\u00eda. In the 1980s, her parents started S\u00edntesis, a pioneering band that performed secular versions of that musical liturgy through electric jazz fusion. In fact, her parents, Carlos Alfonso and Ele Vald\u00e9s, join her on vocals on this three-song set, which she recorded in Havana.\n\nAs with all things spiritual, it's best to start off paying homage to all things greater, which she does with a track from her 2018 album Voy, \"Ayabba,\" a prayer sung in Yoruba and interpreted for voice and jazz trio (in this case, bassist Julio C\u00e9sar Gonz\u00e1lez, pianist Jorge Arag\u00f3n and drummer Oliver Vald\u00e9s).\n\n\"Libre\" showcases the historic musical ties between the US and Cuba, as Alfonso's vocals reflect her love for soul and jazz. Jazz is also part of that long-standing cultural give and take, as evidenced by Arag\u00f3n's masterful piano solo.\n\n\"El Bote\" features the preternatural family vocal connection between Alfonso and her parents. In an interview I did with her dad Carlos Alfonso, he told me the main inspiration for the choir-like vocals of their group Sintesis were inspired by Freddie Mercury and Queen. There is a bit of those stacked harmonies in the chorus, before a propulsive drum solo by Oliver Vald\u00e9s that propels the song to a dramatic close.\n\nEme Alfonso is representative of the kind of music that defies expectations of what Cuban music should sound like. This stop in Havana during our \"El Tiny\" tour of Latin music is just the tip of the iceberg of the musical riches of contemporary Cuba.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Ayabba\"\n \u2022 \"Libre\"\n \u2022 \"El Bote\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Eme Alfonso: vocals\n \u2022 Ele Vald\u00e9s: vocals\n \u2022 Carlos Alfonso: vocals\n \u2022 Jorge Arag\u00f3n: piano\n \u2022 Oliver Vald\u00e9s: drums\n \u2022 Julio C\u00e9sar Gonz\u00e1lez: bass\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Daniel Santoyo, Mauricio Valera, Ana Rafaela Riego\n \u2022 Audio: Bosito, Jos\u00e9 Justo Enrique\n \u2022 Director of Photography: Bryan Gonz\u00e1lez\n \u2022 Colorist: Daniel Alem\u00e1n\n \u2022 Production Assistant: Boris Sergueevich\n \u2022 Camera Operator: Carla Franco\n \u2022 Camera Operator: Luis Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez\n \u2022 Camera Operator: Alejandro Calero\n \u2022 Camera Assistant: Ra\u00fal Amargo\n \u2022 Gaffer: Jes\u00fas Dulfo\n \u2022 Lighting Equipment: Raydel Grizzle\n \u2022 Jonathan L.
