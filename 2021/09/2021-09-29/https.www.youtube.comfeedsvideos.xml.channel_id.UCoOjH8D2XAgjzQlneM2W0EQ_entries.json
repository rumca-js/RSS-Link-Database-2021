Basically, a labor union is an organization workers could join for a fee, and in exchange, they would (in theory) get protection from the union against their employers lowering their wages, firing them for no reason, or from bad working conditions. \n\nOne of the first strikes ever recorded happened in 1768 in New York when workers started protesting against getting their salaries cut. \n\nSuddenly, everyone saw the power of collective bargaining, and people started demanding things like better salaries and less working hours per day. For skilled workers, unions could perform miracles. \n\nEmployers obviously weren\u2019t exactly happy with these strikes, higher wages, and better working conditions. So to fight back, they needed to find ways to put an end to the strikes.\n\nBut as we all know, the only way to fight fire, is with fire! \n\nMafia controlled labor unions would soon become one of their most powerful, influential weapons.\n\nWhen the unions came knocking at the mafia\u2019s door for help, the mobsters saw an opportunity of a lifetime. The two things any good mafioso wants most in his life is money and power, and by joining the unions they could get both. \n\nThe mafia took over so many unions that at one point, La Cosa Nostra had unions in every major city in the US.\n\nUnions gave the mafia a chance to expand, get richer, and spread their influence like never before. At one point, you couldn\u2019t even tell the difference between unions and the mob.\n\nLike all good things, the marriage between the mafia and labor unions eventually had to come to an end. What had seemed like an unbreakable partnership was left in pieces.\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
