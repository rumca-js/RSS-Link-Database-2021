Statement on COVID-19 (SAGE)\n\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1017129/S1376_SPI-M-O_Consensus_Statement.pdf\n\nScientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M)\n\nThe UK is currently experiencing high prevalence and likely entering a period of growth\n\nA time of significant uncertainty\n\nSchool holidays\n\nPossibility for further evidence to emerge on the duration of immunity against COVID-19\n\nPossibly broader, longer peaks than those originally estimated\n\nPotential for another large wave of hospitalisations\n\nIncreasing cases remain the earliest warning sign that hospital admissions are likely to rise\n\nClear consensus that continued high levels of homeworking has played a very important role in preventing sustained epidemic growth\n\nHighly likely that a significant decrease in homeworking in the next few months would result in a rapid increase in hospital admissions\n\nIf enacted early enough, a relatively light set of measures could be sufficient to curb sustained growth\n\nCurrent epidemic estimates \n\nUK (Health Security Agency)\n\nR in England is between 0.9 and 1.1\n\nGrowth rate is between -1% and +1% per day \n\nIt is unclear how high prevalence and admissions may go without intervention. \n\nReflections on modelling Step 4 of the Roadmap \n\nAfter step 4 of the Roadmap on 19th  July\n\nFactors\n\nSchools closed for summer\n\nChanges in behaviour\n\nChanges in mixing patterns have been more gradual\n\nthe population has not reduced their cautious behaviours as dramatically as was considered possible\n\nWarm weather\n\nMore sunshine\n\nLarge proportion of the population isolating after being identified as a contact of a case\n\nImperial\u2019s modelling\n\n\u2018pessimistic scenarios\u2019 which assume a three-year average duration of infection-induced immunity\n\nDoes not consider any variants of concern beyond Delta\n\nPeaks occurring in October to December instead of August to October\n\nHighest levels seen in Step 4 Roadmap scenarios\n\nWill not be reached without waning immunity\nor a novel variant emerging\n\nBehaviour was assumed to be consistent across age groups\n\nIf those at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 take greater precautions, \n\nlevels of hospital admissions and deaths could be lower than those seen in the Roadmap modelling \n\nVaccine effectiveness estimates continue to be refined\n\nThere is now evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness particularly 140 days after the second dose\n\nThose individuals vaccinated in late 2020 and early 2021 will have less protection in the coming months\n\nThird doses and booster vaccinations, which are able to reverse waning of protection, will limit the impact of waning immunity\n\nPolicy clarification\n\nThird doses for all over 50 or at increased risk\n\nUK Chief Medical Officers, advised vaccination aged 12 to 15\n\nIf acute COVID-19 combines

epidemic flat, would be sufficient if enacted when hospitalisations were at a manageable level. \n\nIf the epidemic were allowed to continue to grow until hospitalisations were at a level that needed to be rapidly reduced, \n\nmuch more stringent measures would be needed to bring prevalence down quickly. \n\nThe nature of interventions \n\nIf enacted early enough, a relatively light set of measures could be likely be sufficient to curb sustained but slow growth", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPrKA5p9a_I", "date_published": "2021-09-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false,
