What musical \u201chook\u201d is more recognizable than the opening guitar lick of \u201cSweet Child O\u2019 Mine\u201d? But go deep into your psyche and imagine what this legendary rock tune would have sounded like if it had been instead written by an emotional father of a bride for her walk down the aisle? Did we get it right? \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\udc70\ud83c\udffc\n\nWe hope you can hear the bell chimes, the awe-inspired intake of breath, the heartfelt emotion, the heaviness of \u201closing a daughter\u201d overcome by the buoyancy of \u201cgaining a son;\u201d the collective moments leading up to this life event; the hopes, the dreams, all underscored by the overarching joy of witnessing the opening of a beautiful new chapter. How does a father put into words this moment, when his daughter is flying away in order to fulfill what she is meant to become? Where words fail, music speaks. Our nickname for this special take is, \u201cSweet Child Divine.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udfb9 About the Piano: \nThe very special piano used in this video, called the Yamaha Pro2000, was introduced to the piano industry by Phillip Keveren and Craig Knudsen on behalf of Yamaha at the NAMM Show in the year 2000. Only a handful were ever made, with one of them ending up in the Smithsonian. This piano featured a split plexiglass lid that was the original \u201cbig brother\u201d to the Yamaha \u201cNeo\u201d featured in so many other TPG album covers and videos (What Makes You Beautiful, Bourne Vivaldi etc.) over the years. Master Piano builder/technician (and Kurt Russell look-alike) Justin Elliot wrapped it in a very special reflective chrome for this \u201cchilled out\u201d look. \nExact Piano Location: 37.823500, -114.412676\n\n \ud83c\udfbb About the Cello:\nSteve is playing the ONLY TITANIUM CELLO in the world. \u201cAthena Titania'' was designed and handcrafted for Steven by the incomparable Andy Halbert. Andy spent 270 hours perfecting Athena, literally shaping her in the refiner\u2019s fire in order for her to become what she was destined to become. Andy would like to specifically thank Robin Ankrom, his elementary school teacher, who he reports is a Piano Guys fan. \ud83d\ude04\nExact Cello Location: 37.823466, -114.412684\n\nSong & Video Credits:\nSweet Child O\u2019 Mine written by: Guns N\u2019 Roses\nThe Piano Guys Arrangement produced by: Al van der Beek & Steven Sharp Nelson, written by David Tolk Phillip Keveren Al van der Beek & Steven Sharp Nelson\nOrchestrated by: Phillip Keveren & Steven Sharp Nelson\nOrchestral strings recorded by: Kent (Hoop) Hooper, recording engineer at \u201cthe house of BIG\u201d in Franklin, Tennessee\nVocal textures by: Mackenzie Tolk, recorded at David Tolk Studios\nPiano recorded by: David Tolk at his studios and Steve at TPG studios\nSolo cello recorded at: TPG studios\nMixed & Mastered by: Al van der Beek\nPerformed by: Jon Schmidt (piano) & Steven Sharp Nelson (cello)\nSheet music transcriptions by: Craig Knudsen \n\nSpecial shoutout:\nDavid Tolk https://davidtolk.com\nPhillip Keveren https://phillipkeveren.com/\n\nAbout The Piano Guys:\nPaul, a Yamaha dealer who dabbled in videography, Jon, a professional pianist, Al, a music producer and studio engineer, and Steve, a cellist with a creative superpower called ADHD, all serendipitously joined forces to create the most successful YouTube instrumental music group in history.
