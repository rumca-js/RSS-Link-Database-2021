This week, Mary Lucia talks about Spike Lee's new documentary series on HBO, "NYC Epicenters 9/11➔2021½."

"You know how we all walked around in 2020?" Mary asks. "At every turn, every news headline, every story made you go, 'What is happening? How can we explain this? What is going on? How did everything come unhinged?' This documentary gives you as close an answer to why and how it happened the way it happened. 

"Run, and watch this," Mary continues. "It's possibly the most amazing thing I've watched — ever!"
