On their quest to prevent it, Kratos and Atreyus return to find Odin. While the trailer didn't feature the all-father this time, we did get a quick look at Thor.

With the exception of previous director Cory Barlog-who directed God of War from 2018 as well as God of War 2 from 2007. God of War Ragnarok is slated to release in 2022.  \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:20 - The Story So Far\n03:27 - Combat\n04:17 - The World\n04:52 - Voice Cast\n05:09 - Music\n05:27 - New Director\n06:12 - Platforms\n\n#godofwar #ragnarok", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7swc1R0aIrY", "date_published": "2021-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
