Zooming out, the camera reveals the members of Diamante El\u00e9ctrico, accompanied by a colorful 10-piece backing ensemble in their home country's capital, Bogot\u00e1.\n\nDiamante El\u00e9ctrico's brand of Colombian indie rock can be described in three words: funky, inventive and necessary. The Latin Grammy-winning band's music emphasizes community and place \u2014 two things that are displayed front and center as the band takes the stage in the second \"El Tiny\" performance of Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\n\"NO MIEDO!!!\" (no fear) and \"VERDAD\" (truth) adorn the worn-down desks as the collective powers through a politically-charged four-song set. Opening with 2018's \"Rotos,\" they breathe champeta life into their songs through horns and instruments like the guacharaca, played by singer Juan Galeano's brother Mario. They follow with \"Su\u00e9ltame Bogot\u00e1,\" an upbeat plea to escape a suffocating home, and feature a spirited guest performance by Nicolai Fella of LosPetitFellas. \"Amalia\" leads into a genuine expression of thanks and solidarity, as Galeano gives gratitude to those protesting on \"primeras l\u00ednea y segunda l\u00ednea,\" shouting out the students and farmers challenging the government before finishing the set with \"A Veces.\"\n\nIt's why Diamante El\u00e9ctrico has made themselves so crucial, not only in the Latin indie rock scene, but in music at large: the band's tether to its home country is substantial, no matter how fraught it may seem. Through both its music and stage presence, Diamante El\u00e9ctrico curates a shared sense of Latin roots and family, expanding outward from its home of Colombia and resonating across Latinidad, from Puerto Rico to Panama.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Rotos\"\n\"Su\u00e9ltame, Bogot\u00e1\"\n\"Amalia\"\n\"A Veces\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJuan Galeano: vocals\nDaniel \u00c1lvarez Mej\u00eda: guitar, vocals\nAndr\u00e9s Kenguan: wurlitzer\nMario Galeano: loops, guacharaca, delay, cymbals\nMarco Fajardo: saxophone\nSebasti\u00e1n Rozo [EufoX]: euphonium\nDaniel Rinc\u00f3n Ucros: tuba, sousaphone\nJorge \"El Le\u00f3n\" Pardo: trumpet\nPedro Ojeda: percussion\nRoberta Leono: tambor alegre\nAlejandro Cifuentes: bombo\nLafer Angova: vocals\nKaren Castiblanco: vocals\nNicolai Fella: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Andr\u00e9s Kenguan, Santiago Cort\u00e9s, Gustavo Mart\u00ednez\nAudio: Juan Galeano, Mario Galeano\nArrangements: Mario Galeano\nGeneral Production: Ximena Vargas Rocha\nAudio Capture: Pablo Mateus, Fredy Ardila\nCameras: Sebasti\u00e1n Chocont\u00e1, Nicol\u00e1s Melo, Camilo B\u00e1ez, Felipe Ram\u00edrez\nGaffer: Victor Serje\nDirector of Photography: Santiago Cort\u00e9s, Gustavo Mart\u00ednez\nArt Direction: Pigmento Arte, Nathalie Bayona, Carolina Cardona\nProduction Manager: Carla V\u00e1squez\nColor: Jorge Rom\u00e1n Herrera - Crayola Films\nManagement: Criteria Entertainment, M3 Music\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAlt.Latino 'El Tiny' Team: Felix Contreras, Reanna Cruz, Ana\u00efs Laurent, Stefanie Fernandez\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #eltiny #diamanteelectrico", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J5zTLnIqMY", "date_published": "2021-09-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Meet NPR Music's 2021 Tiny Desk Contest Winner", "description": "On Friday, Sept. 17, NPR Music's Bob Boilen interviewed the winner of the 2021 Tiny Desk Contest: Neffy!  \n\nNeffy is a singer-songwriter from Arlington, Va., with a stunning, singular voice whose songs combine influences from folk, soul and R&B. Her entry video for \u201cWait Up,\u201d which reflects on the healing power of nature, is a testament to her honest, emotional songwriting. Since teaching herself guitar as a teenager, Neffy has played hundreds of shows in New York and Washington, D.C., and says she considers live performances as the best part of her creative process.\n\nHer winning song, \"Wait Up,\" was chosen by a panel of judges out of thousands of entries from across the country.\n\nLearn more about the Tiny Desk Contest: https://npr.org/tinydeskcontest.\n\n#tinydesk #tinydeskcontest", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJYRN5UNZY", "date_published": "2021-09-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "J Balvin: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an \"El Tiny\" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad. \n\nReanna Cruz | September 16, 2021\nA tattooed hand scrawls on a small school desk \u2014 \"Jose by J Balvin\" \u2014 followed by a signature smile. It's an intimate beginning for the pr\u00edncipe del reggaet\u00f3n, J Balvin himself, as he begins his \"El Tiny\" performance on a sunny barge in the middle of the East River. Backed by the Brooklyn Bridge, Balvin breezes through some of the best cuts off of his new album JOSE (Balvin's birth name). The first three \u2014 \"Vestido,\" \"Que Locura\" and \"OTRO FILI\" \u2014 are moody and gentle popet\u00f3n, creating expectations of familiar intimacy before he blows the performance wide open with the Tainy-produced, tempo-shifting album opener, \"F40.\" And as the sun descends on the New York skyline, Balvin closes it out with a drop-laden extended mix of the jock-jam Skrillex collaboration, \"In Da Getto.\"\n\nTo talk about modern Latin music is to talk about J Balvin. Over the course of the past 10 years, \"the boy from Medell\u00edn\" has risen from humble beginnings in Colombia to global superstardom, building an unprecedented fanbase at the intersection of pop, reggaet\u00f3n, house and hip-hop, with over 18 billion views and 35 million record sales to prove it. He is the first Latino to headline Coachella and Lollapalooza, and there isn't a more fitting artist to kick off our month of \"El Tiny\" performances \u2014 Balvin is the epitome of cross-cultural success.\n\nWhen a drone flies out during the last drop of \"In Da Getto,\" and we finally see the true scope of the barge that Balvin has been performing on, it serves as a reminder that no matter how personal his songs may be, Balvin will always, always, be massive.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Vestido\"\n\"Que Locura\"\n\"OTRO FILI\"\n\"F40\"\n\"In Da Getto\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJ Balvin: vocals\nJose Rivera: DJ\nGeorge Ponce: bass, keys\nMarcus Thomas: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Jose-Emilio Sagar\u00f3 Anca Valeanu Omar Reynoso Christopher Cabrera\nAudio: John Buitrago Fernando Argento Hugo Pinzon John Cardona\nProduction Company: Filmheads\nAssistant Director: Iohana Sagaro\nDirector of Photography: Kristoff Cabrera\nProduction Manager: Alejandro (ADO) Arias\nFront of House: John Buitrago\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Anamaria Sayre\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAlt.Latino 'El Tiny' Team: Felix Contreras, Reanna Cruz, Ana\u00efs Laurent, Stefanie Fernandez\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Maia Stern, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #jbalvin", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coMyNfnNBs4", "date_published": "2021-09-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
