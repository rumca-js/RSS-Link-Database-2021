Valve spoke a little bit more about the Steam Deck, to clarify the situation on supporting the whole Steam library.

Firefox 92 was released. It's a pretty minor update, with more ways to upgrade the connection to HTTPS, and support for full range color levels for video playback. It also brings the rest of the browser in line with their "Proton" redesign, notably the bookmarks toolbar and the overflow menu.
