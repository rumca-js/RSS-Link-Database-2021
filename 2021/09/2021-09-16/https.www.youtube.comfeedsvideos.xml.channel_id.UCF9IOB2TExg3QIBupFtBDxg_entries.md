Idaho, crisis standards of care

Population, 1.8 million

https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/09/16/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/

Hospitals allowed to ration care

Expands its “crisis standards of care” criteria

Idaho Department of Health, Dave Jeppesen

The situation is dire 

We don’t have enough resources to adequately treat the patients in our hospitals, whether you are there for COVID-19 or a heart attack or because of a car accident

Allows prioritization

Potentially deny care, based on who they think will benefit most

In other words, someone who is otherwise healthy and would recover more rapidly may get treated or have access to a ventilator before someone who is not likely to recover

Zoe update from 16th September

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/with-the-highest-cases-in-europe-uk-should-trigger-plan-b-now

Based on PCR and LFT test data from up to 11th September, (n = 32,409)

Average of 47,276 new symptomatic cases per day for UK

Previous 7 days was 51,876 (down 9%)

In the New daily cases in the fully vaccinated

15,493 new daily symptomatic cases

(previous 7 days t was 17,674)

Across the different age groups

Daily new cases in18-35s down sharply

Daily new cases in 0 - 18s up (as schools return)

Across the regions

Many of the English regions, falling or stable 

Scotland cases have stopped rising, although hospitalisations still increasing

Prevalence

1 in 95 in UK currently have symptomatic COVID

UK R = 0.9

Wales, 1.0 (only rising region)

Scotland, 1.0

Symptoms for longer than 12 weeks

781 people a day will go on to experience this longer covid

Reduced commensurate with reduced symptomatic cases

Tim Spector

After calling for a plan for several weeks I’m pleased to see the government has launched a booster vaccine programme. 

(To give boosters to everyone over 50)

the winter plan fails to introduce the current symptoms to the list

now most people experience symptoms like sore throat, headache and sneezing rather than fever or cough

I also don't understand why we are waiting for the situation to get worse and the NHS is pressured further before implementing simple measures that would help to bring down the number of new cases and save lives. 

With such high levels of virus in the population we should also still be wearing masks and keeping our distance in crowded public places, as in major European cities where cases are much lower than ours.

New restrictions on prescribing ivermectin for COVID-19
https://www.tga.gov.au/media-release/new-restrictions-prescribing-ivermectin-covid-19
(10 September 2021)

TGA, acting on the advice of the Advisory Committee for Medicines Scheduling

placed new restrictions on the prescribing of oral ivermectin. 

General practitioners are now only able to prescribe ivermectin for TGA-approved conditions - scabies and certain parasitic infections

Certain specialists will be permitted to prescribe ivermectin for other unapproved indications if they believe it is appropriate for a particular patient

Ivermectin is not approved for use in COVID-19 in Australia

currently strongly discouraged by the National COVID Clinical Evidence Taskforce, the World Health Organisation and the US Food and Drug Administration

https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/ivermectin/

Recommendation

There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19. 

Firstly

there are a number of significant public health risks associated with taking ivermectin in an attempt to prevent COVID-19 infection rather than getting vaccinated

Individuals who believe that they are protected from infection by taking ivermectin may choose not to get tested or to seek medical care if they experience symptoms. 

Doing so has the potential to spread the risk of COVID-19 infection throughout the community.

Secondly

the doses of ivermectin that are being advocated for use in unreliable social media posts and other sources for COVID-19 are significantly higher than those approved and found safe for scabies or parasite treatment. 

These higher doses can be associated with serious adverse effects, including severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, neurological effects such as dizziness, seizures and coma.

BMJ

Untreated paracetamol poisoning may cause varying degrees of liver injury over the 2 to 4 days following ingestion, including fulminant hepatic failure.

Finally

there has been a 3-4-fold increased dispensing of ivermectin prescriptions in recent months, leading to national and local shortages for those who need the medicine for scabies and parasite infections

It is believed that this is due to recent prescribing and dispensing for unapproved uses, such as COVID-19. 
 
Such shortages can disproportionately impact vulnerable people, including those in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

There is only one TGA approved oral ivermectin product, Stromectol ivermectin 3mg tablet blister pack

Indicated for the treatment of river blindness (onchocerciasis), threadworm of the intestines (intestinal strongyloidiasis) and scabies.

All medical practitioners can continue to prescribe oral ivermectin for the approved indications. 

However, prescribing of oral ivermectin for indications that are not approved is now limited to certain specialists.


 


Onchocerciasis

https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis

More than 99% of infected people live in 31 African countries. The disease also exists in some foci in Latin America and Yemen.
