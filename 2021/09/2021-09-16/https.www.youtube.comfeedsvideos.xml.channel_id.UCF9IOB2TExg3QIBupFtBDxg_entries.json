scabies and certain parasitic infections\n\nCertain specialists will be permitted to prescribe ivermectin for other unapproved indications if they believe it is appropriate for a particular patient\n\nIvermectin is not approved for use in COVID-19 in Australia\n\ncurrently strongly discouraged by the National COVID Clinical Evidence Taskforce, the World Health Organisation and the US Food and Drug Administration\n\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/ivermectin/\n\nRecommendation\n\nThere is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19. \n\nFirstly\n\nthere are a number of significant public health risks associated with taking ivermectin in an attempt to prevent COVID-19 infection rather than getting vaccinated\n\nIndividuals who believe that they are protected from infection by taking ivermectin may choose not to get tested or to seek medical care if they experience symptoms. \n\nDoing so has the potential to spread the risk of COVID-19 infection throughout the community.\n\nSecondly\n\nthe doses of ivermectin that are being advocated for use in unreliable social media posts and other sources for COVID-19 are significantly higher than those approved and found safe for scabies or parasite treatment. \n\nThese higher doses can be associated with serious adverse effects, including severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, neurological effects such as dizziness, seizures and coma.\n\nhttps://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/ivermectin.html\n\nhttps://shop.amh.net.au/products/digital\n\nhttps://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-ivermectin-131030-pi.pdf\n\nBMJ\n\nhttps://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/3000110\n\nUntreated paracetamol poisoning may cause varying degrees of liver injury over the 2 to 4 days following ingestion, including fulminant hepatic failure.\n\nFinally\n\nthere has been a 3-4-fold increased dispensing of ivermectin prescriptions in recent months, leading to national and local shortages for those who need the medicine for scabies and parasite infections\n\nIt is believed that this is due to recent prescribing and dispensing for unapproved uses, such as COVID-19. \n \nSuch shortages can disproportionately impact vulnerable people, including those in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.\n\nThere is only one TGA approved oral ivermectin product, Stromectol ivermectin 3mg tablet blister pack\n\nIndicated for the treatment of river blindness (onchocerciasis), threadworm of the intestines (intestinal strongyloidiasis) and scabies.\n\nAll medical practitioners can continue to prescribe oral ivermectin for the approved indications. \n\nHowever, prescribing of oral ivermectin for indications that are not approved is now limited to certain specialists.\n\n\n \n\n\nOnchocerciasis\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis\n\nMore than 99% of infected people live in 31 African countries.
