The Halo franchise defined a generation for console gamers. Halo 2 had one of the biggest influences on the shooter space even though it was riddled with glitches. But rather than being rejected or patched, Halo glitches were embraced and became a required skill in the PVP scene and competition. Join Persia as she goes over some of the best glitches that made Halo 2 truly unique with former Halo pro, Eli the Ninja.

In this video, Persia talks about iconic glitches in Halo 2 that added to the skill-ceiling of competitive multiplayer with former Halo pro, Eli the Ninja. From BXR to BXB and more, these unintentional glitches lead to combos that are used far and wide by many Halo 2 players and pros to this day.

With Halo having many different titles within the franchise, Halo 2 stands out due to these glitches and you can still perform them in the Master Chief: Collection’s Halo 2: Classic playlist.

Halo: Infinite is right around the corner after its release date of December 8th, 2021 was confirmed by Microsoft at Gamescom Opening Night Live and is now available for pre-order. You can check out our pre-order guide on gamespot.com.

We officially live in a reality where Destiny's Trials of Osiris is no longer half baked. The pinnacle end game PvP activity is rewarding as ever and is the most popular weekend activity in Destiny 2. Here's why every Destiny 2 and FPS gamer needs to check it out. 

Trials of Osiris relaunched during Destiny 2’s Season of the Lost with lots of new changes, and the revamp is a major triumph for developer Bungie. The mode used to be a bit of a waste of time for all but the best Destiny players, but that’s no longer the case -- although there have been some rough passages for solo players. 

Trials of Osiris requires players to duke it out in a high stakes Elimination PvP mode where teamplay and callouts are just as important as individual skill level, and the stakes grow with each successive match. Players hope to go “Flawless” where they win 7 matches in a row without losing any, in hopes of reaching the Lighthouse, an exclusive social space that is open only to Flawless players  and that provides exclusive "adept" rewards. 

Not too long ago, going flawless in Trials felt like an insurmountable task but we’re at an unprecedented time now where skill-based matchmaking, crossplay, a new rewards track, and an incredible amount of interest in the game mode has led to easily one of the best Trials weekends in Destiny history. In this video we break down all the major changes and why everyone, not just PvP addicts or Destiny superfans, should hop in and see just what Trials is all about now.
