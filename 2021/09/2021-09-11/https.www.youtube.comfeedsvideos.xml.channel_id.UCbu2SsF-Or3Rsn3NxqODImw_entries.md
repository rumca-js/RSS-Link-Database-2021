PlayStation owners have been blessed with numerous exclusives over the years, and we're here to pick 15 of our all-time favorites. Everything from the Uncharted and God Of War to Bloodborne and Persona 5.

The PS4 (and even the PS5 so far) has been defined by its exclusives. While Sony's PlayStation consoles have had notable exclusive games over the years, a significant number of the very best games on modern PlayStation consoles are exclusives. From sterling action games like God of War and Marvel's Spider-Man to brilliant RPGs such as Final Fantasy VII Remake and Persona 5 Royal, recent PlayStation exclusives have been mightily impressive. We've rounded up the best PlayStation exclusives for PS4 and PS5. While most of these games are playable on both PS4 and PS5, we've included a few PS5 exclusives as well.
