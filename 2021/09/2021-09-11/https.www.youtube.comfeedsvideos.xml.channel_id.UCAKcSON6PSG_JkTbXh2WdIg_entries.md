Earlier this week, Jimmy Sutton, longtime bassist with JD McPherson, announced his amicable departure from the JD McPherson band. Sutton will be setting music aside to spend more time with his visual art and with his wife and their young daughter. But as he declared in his Instagram posts about his departure, Sutton leaves with a lot of memories. There certainly have been a lot of great memories just at The Current when it comes to JD McPherson — including a number of in-studio sessions — plus these two lively performances recorded at Rock the Garden 2015.
