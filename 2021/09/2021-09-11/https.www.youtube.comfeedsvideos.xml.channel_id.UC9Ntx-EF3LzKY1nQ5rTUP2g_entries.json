Not even in this video, you didn't see that bit.\n\n\nCyriak Animator Pro also gives you the tools to make your own video soundtrack, with patented rubber band technology and some other crap I found in my kitchen. Download it now from nowhere because it isn't real (or is it?) no it isn't (ok).\n\n\nThis video was made with Cyriak Animator Pro, the animation software that animates without any animating, which is more of a pain in the arse than I thought it would be.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVvewPxyub0", "date_published": "2021-09-11 15:06:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
