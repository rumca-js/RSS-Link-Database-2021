Burden and characteristics of COVID-19 in the United States during 2020

Columbia University and NIH, Director Francis S. Collins, Nature

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34438440/#affiliation-3

United States, 2020, highest numbers of reported cases and deaths

In the light of later antibody studies

March 11.3%

December, 24.5%

Population susceptibility at year's end was 69.0%

So, 31% of population had been exposed

(100 million people)

Prevalence rates rose above 0.8% by end of 2020

As high as 2.4% in some major metropolitan areas

Infection fatality rate fell to 0.3% by end of 2020

As of September 2

5,049,465 children have tested positive

252,000 cases were added the past week

Largest number of child cases in a week ever

Since the pandemic began, children, 15.1% of total cumulated cases

Week ending September 2nd, 26.8% of reported weekly COVID-19 cases

2,400 children were hospitalized nationwide (highest in pandemic)

Hospitalizations (24 states and NYC reported)

Children ranged from 1.6%-4.1% of total cumulated hospitalizations

0.1%-1.9% of all their child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization

Mortality (45 states)

Children were 0.00%-0.27% of all COVID-19 deaths

(7 states reported zero child deaths)

0.00%-0.03% of all child COVID-19 cases resulted in death

Vaccination in children

Half of children ages 12 to 15 have received at least one vaccine dose

58 percent for 16- and 17-year-olds

Anthony Fauci, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

We’ve got to get the school system masked, 

in addition to surrounding the children with vaccinated people

That’s the solution

Los Angeles mandates today

Soon mandate vaccination for school attendance

600,000 would have to get their first shot by Oct. 3

Second shot by the end of October

(LA counts since last month)

Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca chief executive on Booster doses

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/09/07/covid-booster-jab-campaign-may-not-needed-says-astra-boss/

UK is still "a few weeks away" from being able to decide

Moving too quickly to boost across the entire adult population will deprive us of these insights,

leaving this important decision to rest on limited data

NHS resource implications

Nadhim Zahawi 

NHS is ‘ready to go’ 

Philip Dormitzer, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer

Encouraged booster shots

Dismissed criticism that his company should have produced a more potent vaccine

Professor Sarah Gilbert

https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/creator-oxford-vaccine-sarah-gilbert-warns-vulnerable-will-have-shield-covid-19-cases-rise-1096315

UK, 3.8 million people classed as clinically extremely vulnerable

In people who have been vaccinated and have had the two doses, 

they will be well protected against disease that is severe enough to put them in hospital and against death

And there are unfortunately some people with particular health conditions that mean they just don’t respond to a vaccine

and they are going to have to make sure that they are protected, probably by shielding again, 

if there is a lot of spread of the virus


 



https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19

we are advising clinically extremely vulnerable people, as a minimum, to follow the same guidance as everyone else

you may wish to think particularly carefully about additional precautions you might wish to continue to take


Sweden

Removing all remaining restrictions by the end of this month

Vietnam

Health Ministry, offering Pfizer-BioNTech as a second-dose after Moderna 

(low supplies of the Moderna)

Switzerland

Covid certificates for bars, restaurants, fitness centres starting Monday

(Hospitals busy with wave of infections)

Proof of vaccination, recovery from infection or negative test result

Novavax

Started early-stage study to test combined flu and booster coronavirus vaccine

Along with an adjuvant

Idaho, activates “crisis standards of care” 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/09/07/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/

Activated “crisis standards of care” 10 hospitals

because of a severe shortage of staffing and available beds

massive increase in patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization

Less than 40% fully vaccinated

May have to wait for beds
Get treated in hallways etc

Delayed operations

Basic equipment may not be available

Governor Brad Little

More Idahoans need to choose to receive the vaccine so we can minimize the spread of the disease and reduce the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations,

many of which involve younger Idahoans and are preventable with safe and effective vaccines

The safety profile evidenced was similar between the groups compared

Adults in Cuba Abdala vaccine, (efficacy, 92%) since July
