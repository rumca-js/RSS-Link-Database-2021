AI-derived scores rank individuals based on their profitability or risk as consumers, job candidates, or even defendants in court. Machine-learning algorithms decide your life.

Businesses, courts and the police have adopted artificial intelligence to assign scores to individuals based on poorly understood statistical analysis. The public needs to start a dialogue about whether or not we want to accept the ethics of this practice. 

Throughout my research, I have been able to identify seven different scores maintained on individuals or locations. Here’s what I could find. You have a:
    • consumer score, which is now widespread among customer-oriented enterprises
    • Health Score and Driver Score, – both of which are sought by insurance companies and I already covered these two scoring systems in separate videos. 
    • Credit Rating Score – used in lending, loaning and banking markets. 
    • Job Applicant Score – most commonly deployed in resume scanning and candidate ranking
    • a risk-assessment score used in criminal justice system,
    • and a predictive policing score
