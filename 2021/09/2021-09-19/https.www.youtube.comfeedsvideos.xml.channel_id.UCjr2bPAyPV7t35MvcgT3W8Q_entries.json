The public needs to start a dialogue about whether or not we want to accept the ethics of this practice. \n\nThroughout my research, I have been able to identify seven different scores maintained on individuals or locations. Here\u2019s what I could find. You have a:\n    \u2022 consumer score, which is now widespread among customer-oriented enterprises\n    \u2022 Health Score and Driver Score, \u2013 both of which are sought by insurance companies and I already covered these two scoring systems in separate videos. \n    \u2022 Credit Rating Score \u2013 used in lending, loaning and banking markets. \n    \u2022 Job Applicant Score \u2013 most commonly deployed in resume scanning and candidate ranking\n    \u2022 a risk-assessment score used in criminal justice system,\n    \u2022 and a predictive policing score\n\nSources\n\nBias and privacy concerns: https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/10/ethical-concerns-mount-as-ai-takes-bigger-decision-making-role/\n\nConsumer score\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952239/secret-consumer-score-data-privacy-kashmir-hill-airbnb-yelp\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/business/secret-consumer-score-access.html\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/on-hold-for-45-minutes-it-might-be-your-secret-customer-score-1541084656 \nhttps://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/secret-consumer-scores-explain-why-some-people-get-much-better-service-than-others-now-you-can-finally-request-your-data-get-your-file.html\n\nHealth score\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2015/12/15/insurance-big-data/\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/health-insurers-are-vacuuming-up-details-about-you-and-it-could-raise-your-rates\nhttps://time.com/4588104/medical-data-industry/\nhttps://www.revealnews.org/blog/your-medical-data-is-for-sale-and-theres-nothing-you-can-do-about-it/\n\nDriver score\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/17/what-does-your-car-know-about-you-we-hacked-chevy-find-out/\nhttps://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/the-cameras-in-your-car-may-be-harvesting-data-as-you-drive-a3473812015/\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive%20and%20assembly/our%20insights/monetizing%20car%20data/monetizing-car-data.ashx\n\nJob applicant score\nAmazon hiring AI bias: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/the-resume-may-no-longer-be-the-tool-for-hiring-a-more-diverse-team.html\nResume screening: https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/12/20993665/artificial-intelligence-ai-job-screen\nhttps://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/ai-artificial-intelligence-screening-resumes-how-to-prepare.html\nBabysitter screening: https://gizmodo.com/predictim-claims-its-ai-can-flag-risky-babysitters-so-1830913997\n\nRisk-assessment score in justice system\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/algorithms-shouldve-made-courts-more-fair-what-went-wrong/\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/when-government-rules-by-software-citizens-are-left-in-the-dark/\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/robot-judges-can-determine-guilt-will-commonplace-within-50/\nMachine bias in criminal sentencing: https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-in-the-court-are-robot-judges-next/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/us/backlash-in-wisconsin-against-using-data-to-foretell-defendants-futures.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/politics/sent-to-prison-by-a-software-programs-secret-algorithms.html\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18186674/daniel-chen-machine-learning-rule-of-law-economics-psychology-judicial-system-policy\n\nPredictive policing\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/us/police-program-aims-to-pinpoint-those-most-likely-to-commit-crimes.html\n\nCredits\nMusic by: Karl Casey - White Bat Audio\n\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\nhttps://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUhKTngpd8c", "date_published": "2021-09-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
