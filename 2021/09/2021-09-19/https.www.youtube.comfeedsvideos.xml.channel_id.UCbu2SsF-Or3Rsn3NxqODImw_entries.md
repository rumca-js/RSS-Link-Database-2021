With game development grinding to a halt in 2020, anticipated titles like Battlefield 2042, GhostWire: Tokyo, God of War: Ragnarok, and several more have all been delayed. Here's our list even more games that have been delayed in 2021.

Game development for most of 2020 came to a screeching halt with the wake of the global pandemic. Even into 2021, the wave of delayed games grew by the day, with developers transitioning to their work-from-home environments. As companies continue to regain their momentum, some delays were only temporarily, while some have yet to receive updates. 

Richie Bracamonte is here to break down the laundry list of titles that have been delayed in 2021. Games from just about every category are present from the Warhammer series to more recent entries like Battlefield 2024. Titles that were announced in 2021 that were set for a 2022 release (Diablo 4, Overwatch 2) will not be mentioned on this list.

All of these delays are of course subject to change. As the world continues to adjust from new workspaces, only time will tell if these dates will stick. Stay tuned to GameSpot for the latest news regarding these titles and more.

This year marks the 35th anniversary of Metroid, the loveable bounty hunting, genre defining, child that Nintendo loves to forget about. Except to everyone’s surprise Nintendo did remember this year and are celebrating with Metroid 5, aka Metroid Dread, the first brand new 2D Metroid game in quite a long time.

So long in fact that there is a whole generation of people that have never experienced just how good classic Metroid is, and are looking at all the excitement Dread is causing, and they’re curious. 

For this video, Jean-luc details the best Nintendo approved options available for you. Unfortunately that means buying a Wii U.
