Here's our list even more games that have been delayed in 2021.\n\nGame development for most of 2020 came to a screeching halt with the wake of the global pandemic. Even into 2021, the wave of delayed games grew by the day, with developers transitioning to their work-from-home environments. As companies continue to regain their momentum, some delays were only temporarily, while some have yet to receive updates. \n\nRichie Bracamonte is here to break down the laundry list of titles that have been delayed in 2021. Games from just about every category are present from the Warhammer series to more recent entries like Battlefield 2024. Titles that were announced in 2021 that were set for a 2022 release (Diablo 4, Overwatch 2) will not be mentioned on this list.\n\nAll of these delays are of course subject to change. As the world continues to adjust from new workspaces, only time will tell if these dates will stick. Stay tuned to GameSpot for the latest news regarding these titles and more. \n\nIntroduction - 0:00\nBattlefield 2042 - 0:32\nHorizon Forbidden West - 0:58\nEvil Dead: The Game - 01:25\nGod of War: Ragnarok - 01:46\nRocksmith + - 02:07\nTotal War: Warhammer 3 - 02:27\nLost Ark - 02:45\nNobody Saves the World - 03:10\nAbandoned - 03:32\nLone Echo - 03:57\nLife is Stange: Remastered Collection - 04:20\nDiablo Immortal - 04:45\nSoup Pot - 05:06\nIcarus - 05:25\nHalo Infinite - 05:43\nStray - 06:05\nCrimson Desert - 06:21\nDigimon Survive - 06:40\nRainbow Six Extraction - 07:01\nWarhammer: 40,000 Darktide - 07:24\nResident Evil RE:Verse - 07:44\nGhostwire: Tokyo - 08:04\nKOF 15 - 08:22\nSkull & Bones - 08:49\nFive Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach - 09:25\nLego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga - 09:50\nGran Turismo 7 - 10:09\nRiders Republic - 10:27\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum - 10:40\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake - 11:09\nHogwarts Legacy - 11:30\nGotham Knights - 11:45\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - 12:18\nDying Light 2 - 12:50\nBack 4 Blood - 13:22\nPragmata - 13:43\nNew World - 14:03\nDestiny 2: The Witch Queen Expansion - 14:24", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgQRw2dhgQ0", "date_published": "2021-09-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Kena  Bridge of Spirits Release Trailer", "description": "Check out the launch trailer for Kena Bridge of Spirits release September 21st on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and the Epic Games Store. \n\nA story-driven action adventure with a stunning visual aesthetic combining exploration with fast-paced combat.
