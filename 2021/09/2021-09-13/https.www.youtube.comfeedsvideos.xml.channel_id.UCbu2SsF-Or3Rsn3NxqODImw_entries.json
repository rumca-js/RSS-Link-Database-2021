You get an array of varied weapons, a handful of creative powers, and the ability to use them in experimentative and inventive ways to progress. And that's true, but Deathloop also introduces new wrinkles to familiar roguelite and first-person shooter elements that might initially be challenging to wrap your head around.

Viewers were treated to gameplay and more following the original 30-second teaser from nearly a year ago. The showcase brought us details with the story, introduced new characters, and showed us new worlds along the way.\n\nTaking place shortly after the events of the first, the trailer reveals that Ragnarok (the Norse mythological end of the world) is indeed coming. On their quest to prevent it, Kratos and Atreyus return to find Odin. While the trailer didn't feature the all-father this time, we did get a quick look at Thor. (played by Sons of Anarchy's Ryan Hurst) \n\nThe presentation ended with a developer interview where new director Eric Williams discussed how Santa Monica Studio likes to change directors when they can for a fresh take on the creative process. With the exception of previous director Cory Barlog-who directed God of War from 2018 as well as God of War 2 from 2007. God of War Ragnarok is slated to release in 2022.  \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:20 - The Story So Far\n03:27 - Combat\n04:17 - The World\n04:52 - Voice Cast\n05:09 - Music\n05:27 - New Director\n06:12 - Platforms\n\n#godofwar #ragnarok", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7swc1R0aIrY", "date_published": "2021-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Deathloop Early Gameplay Livestream", "description": "Join Lucy and Tamoor as they stream the opening hours of Arkane Lyon's latest, Deathloop.\n\n#deathloop", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gSEAXUZnAg", "date_published": "2021-09-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Deathloop Review", "description": "Arkane Lyon's follow-up to Dishonored is a masterclass in open-ended action game design.
