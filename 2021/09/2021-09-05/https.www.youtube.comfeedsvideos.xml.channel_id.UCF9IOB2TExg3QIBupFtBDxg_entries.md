US intelligence community, Unable, split on viral origins

18 agencies, Office of the Director of National Intelligence

Time is running out to gather evidence

WHO panel

Soon, biologically impossible

The window of opportunity for conducting this crucial inquiry is closing fast

All agencies assess that two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident

Several agencies

natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus, low confidence

One intelligence agency

moderate confidence, that the first human infection was likely due a "laboratory-associated incident" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, 

which has studied coronaviruses in bats for more than a decade.

President Biden

Critical information about the origins of this pandemic exists in the People's Republic of China, 

yet from the beginning, government officials in China have worked to prevent international investigators and members of the global public health community from accessing it

The world deserves answers, and I will not rest until we get them

Endgame and exit strategy

Professor Monica Gandhi, University of California

I truly, truly think we are in the endgame

The cases will start plummeting in mid- to late September 

they mutate quickly, at a cost to themselves

we’re sort of at the peak of the pandemic because the delta variant is causing immunity like crazy

Delta comes in like a hurricane, but it leaves a lot of immunity in its wake

we’re going to get it

Unless you just sit in your room, you’re going to get it in your nose

but at least in this country, it will be manageable

Gandhi (Feb, 2020)

United States would not tolerate a disease that killed 100 Americans a day; people would come together to do whatever it took to stop that

Professor Ezekiel Emanuel, University of Pennsylvania

In March 2020, the country back to normal around November 2021

Now, It’s going to be at least spring 2022 and possibly much longer before most people are ready to resume normal activities

Professor Jay Bhattacharya, Stanford University

The emergency phase of the disease is over

Now, we need to work very hard to undo the sense of emergency. 

We should be treating covid as one of 200 diseases that affect people
