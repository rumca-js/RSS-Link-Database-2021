Open-world games have only grown more popular with time, with many series even shifting away from linear design to give players more freedom and bigger areas to explore. Not every open-world game is created equal, however, with classics such as Grand Theft Auto 5 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild standing out against alternatives that rely too much on "stuff to do" and ever-bigger worlds than making the open world suit the experience. That can make it difficult to find the best open-world games, especially on newer consoles that have so many to choose from. We rounded up some of the very best ones, accounting for the world itself being a big reason for their inclusion--games with tremendous stories that happen to have open worlds, such as Nier: Automata, were left off for this reason. We've also geared this mostly toward newer games that are easily accessible today.Â

## The Legend Of Zelda Is The World's Most Tragic Video Game Series

Skyward Sword HD reminds us that Hyrule is in an endless cycle of apocalyptic devastation, and you play the unlucky child reincarnated forever to fight an evil pig monster.

The story of every game of The Legend of Zelda is pretty much the same: Evil monster king tries to claim a godlike wish-granting artifact, the Triforce, in order to dominate the world, and a sword-wielding fairy child and magical princess team up to stop him. There are 27 Zelda games at this point, and the vast majority are remixes of that basic idea in some form or another. And for years, that's all it seemed like the Zelda games were: different takes on the same idea, the same game revisited with interesting tweaks along the way.

With the release of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, though, Nintendo did a lot to recontextualize the Zelda series. Chronologically, the game is the "first" Zelda title--it marks the beginning of the series, the very first time a monster king was defeated by a sword kid and a magic princess. Casual Zelda fans might not have really thought about it, but that creates some pretty huge implications for the world the Zelda games take place in. It means that each of the adventures in the Zelda series aren't just different takes on the same apocalyptic monster-king war: They're all separate, uniquely horrific apocalyptic monster-king wars.

One of the newest finds in Breath of the Wild has some utility use, but most of all, looks pretty awesome, and brings some anime themes to the game.

Discovered by Satougashi in June 2021, Active Arrow Smuggling, while purely a cosmetic bug, is surely one of the coolest looking glitches found so far. Breath of the Wild continues to show new discoveries, intended and unintended, and we continue to cover them still to this day.
