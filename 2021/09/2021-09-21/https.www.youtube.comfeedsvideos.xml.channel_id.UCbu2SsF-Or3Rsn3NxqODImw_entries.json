The PlayStation console exclusive is available for PS5, PS4, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). If you're jumping in, you may have noticed that Bridge of Spirits is more challenging than the game's cute art style originally lets on--we've got 13 tips to help you be a better spirit guide.\n\nIn Bridge of Spirits, you play as Kena, a spirit guide on a personal quest that sees her stumbling upon a deserted village. The village and its surrounding areas are full of the spirits of the people who once lived there, many of whom can't move on as a result of their individual traumas. Kena's goal lies beyond the village, but she'll only be able to reach it if she helps the spirits she encounters.\n\nFor those still on the fence, check out GameSpot's Kena: Bridge of Spirits review, in which Phil Hornshaw writes, \"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is ultimately a game about making those connections, just like it's about making a connection with the game world around you through the Rot. It centers on characters who tried valiantly but failed to help one another, and what dealing with that pain did to them. It's about exploring a world and seeing what it once was, and helping to restore it again. And while Kena: Bridge of Spirits is full of familiar-feeling combat and exploration, its ability to find different ways to look at those ideas makes for a beautiful, emotional, and exciting journey.\"\n\n#kena #bridgeofspirits", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE79Xj6AlS8", "date_published": "2021-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Halo Infinite Big Team Battle Gameplay Demo", "description": "Check out the Halo Infinite Big Team Battle Gameplay that was unveiled during a Halo Infinite Technical livestream.

See how Star-Lord, Groot, Rocket, and Gamora work, or don't, together.\n\nMost superhero games give you all the power--you are, of course, the hero of the story. With Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, developer Eidos Montreal is taking a different approach, putting you into a superhero team with the focus on making you feel like part of the group. You can't deal with every problem on your own, but it's remarkable how, through the teamwork mechanics within the game, you quickly start to feel like you can work together with the other Guardians to handle any obstacle.\n\nWe recently got to spend about two hours playing a chapter of Guardians of the Galaxy, which gave a sense of both how the choice-based story will unfold and how you'll handle controlling the entire team of Guardians in battle. In both cases, your choices as the de facto leader of the Guardians is important, but yours isn't the only voice that matters. Through its mechanics and its character development, Guardians of the Galaxy puts its focus on being a single-player game that's all about teamwork.\n\n#Marvel'sGuardiansoftheGalaxy #Marvel #GuardiansoftheGalaxy", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3OmyU9Sh5E", "date_published": "2021-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Game Pass In September", "description": "The Game Pass library got a lot bigger this September with the addition of Final Fantasy XIII, SkateBird, and The Artful Escape, with plenty more on the way.\n\nLearn about what's new, what's leaving, and what you should be playing on Game Pass.

You'll see similarities in it from the likes of titles such as Okami, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and a host of other titles in the genre. But developer Ember Studios does a great job of giving a new look on the familiar throughout the game, both to tell the deep and emotional story of a spirit guide helping traumatized ghosts move on from this world, and in how it uses gameplay for some deceptively tough combat and smart puzzles.\n\nYou play as Kena, a spirit guide trying to find out what has happened in the area around an abandoned village, where all the inhabitants have fallen to tragedy. The pained spirits have been twisted by what has happened to them, causing the land around the village to be poisoned by a spreading corruption. Kena's role as a spirit guide is to help heal those ghosts, and to do that, you have to fight their twisted forms with a combination of melee attacks, dodges, and parries.\n\nBut you also have access to the Rot, a group of tiny spirit companions who change up everything about the way Kena plays. The Rot can be used in battle to distract enemies or to power up Kena's special spirit energy attacks. They also work together with your combat abilities to make most fights feel like a puzzle to be solved. The Rot are essential to destroying the poisoned hearts that spread the corruption, and you'll need to think tactically to deploy them at the right time, and in the right way, to defeat Kena's tough enemies and bosses.\n\nWith a big world to explore, lots of innovative puzzles to solve with the abilities of both Kena and the Rot, and some excellently designed boss fights, Kena does a lot to stand apart from similar action-adventure games. Its combination of story and mechanics make it a beautiful journey to take.
