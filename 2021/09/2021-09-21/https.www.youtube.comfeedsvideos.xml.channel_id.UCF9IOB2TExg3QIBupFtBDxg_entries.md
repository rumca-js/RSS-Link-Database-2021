Pfizer for 5 to 11 year olds

https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results

5 to 11 years of age, the vaccine was safe, well tolerated and showed robust neutralizing antibody responses

Companies plan to submit these data to the FDA, EMA and other regulatory agencies

Results in children under 5 years of age are expected as soon as later this year

N = 4,500, Finland, Poland, Spain, US

Two dose, 21 days apart

10 ug, not 30 ug

Similar results to 30 ug in 15 to 25 year olds

Phase 2/3 trial

Side effects reported with the vaccine include:

A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour

Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over the body, dizziness, and weakness

Myocarditis and pericarditis have occurred in some people who have received the vaccine.

In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. 

The chance of having this occur is very low. 

chest pain

shortness of breath

feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart

Other side effects

injection site pain; tiredness; headache; muscle pain; chills; joint pain; fever; injection site swelling; injection site redness; nausea; feeling unwell; swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy); diarrhea; vomiting; arm pain
There is no information on the use of the vaccine with other vaccines

Infectious SARS-CoV-2 in Exhaled Aerosols and Efficacy of Masks During Early Mild Infection 

https://sph.umd.edu/news/covid-19-virus-evolving-get-better-becoming-airborne-new-study-shows

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab797/6370149

Epidemiology implicates airborne transmission, aerosol infectiousness 

Methods

Confirmed cases gave:

Blood, saliva, mid-turbinate and fomite (phone) swabs

30-minute breath samples while vocalizing
with and without masks

Up to two visits two days apart

Quantified and sequenced viral RNA, cultured virus

Results

N = 49 seronegative cases

Mean days post onset 3.8 ± 2.1

May 2020 through April 2021

Detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in alpha variant

45% of fine (less than 5 μm) aerosols

31% of coarse ( more than 5 μm) aerosols

65% of fomite samples

Masks reduced viral RNA by:

48% in fine aerosols

77% in coarse aerosols

Cloth and surgical masks were not significantly different

The alpha variant (compared with earlier viruses)

43-fold increase in fine aerosol viral RNA

Remained a significant 18-fold increase adjusting for viral RNA in saliva, swabs, and other potential confounders

Conclusion

SARS-CoV-2 is evolving toward more efficient aerosol generation

Loose-fitting masks provide significant but only modest source control

Continued layered controls and tight-fitting masks and respirators will be necessary
