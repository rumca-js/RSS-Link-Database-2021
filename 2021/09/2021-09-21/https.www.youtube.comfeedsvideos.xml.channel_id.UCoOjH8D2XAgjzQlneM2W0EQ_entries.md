You run North Korea. To the people of North Korea, you are their greatest hope and joy. You are their god. But your people are starving. North Korea is not poor. How are you living in luxury if North Korea is apparently so “poor”? The Economics of North Korea.

Like any good dictator, you know your rule is only as good as your peoples’ belief in your goodness and power. You have to control every single little piece of information that goes into their heads.

The goal is for everyone to be like those new animals on the farm, with no idea what life was like before the revolution, before Kim Il-Sung. Sure the first generation might not be too submissive because they know this isn’t set in stone. But once you get to the second generation, the third generation - the reign of the Kims will be all they know - and they really will think you are a god.

To successfully run such a utopia, you need to make sure every member of the population believes your story, and your story of the world outside. Everything in North Korean education is brainwashing.

For most North Koreans, Americans aren’t even human. They’re cold blooded monsters who kill and destroy everything they come across. And to continue your brainwashing you go just a few steps further. You decide everything for them. But that’s not enough. The real control point is keeping people hungry.  

A person who is constantly hungry, the only thing that will be on their mind is where they’ll get their next meal. Contrast that with a well-fed pleb - they’ll have time to think about unproductive things like the meaning of life, the pursuit of happiness, is my dear leader really a God? Things that threaten your power! So it’s very simple - keep. them. hungry. 

As the Supreme Leader of North Korea, you are the world’s foremost example of how a dictator can be the god of the 21st century. Those in the West take freedom for granted. Freedom is hard. Freedom requires responsibility. It requires you to think for yourself, to stand on your own two feet. So to an extent, there’s a part of humanity that naturally wants to be ruled.
