To the people of North Korea, you are their greatest hope and joy. You are their god. But your people are starving. North Korea is not poor. How are you living in luxury if North Korea is apparently so \u201cpoor\u201d? The Economics of North Korea.\n\nLike any good dictator, you know your rule is only as good as your peoples\u2019 belief in your goodness and power. You have to control every single little piece of information that goes into their heads.\n\nThe goal is for everyone to be like those new animals on the farm, with no idea what life was like before the revolution, before Kim Il-Sung. Sure the first generation might not be too submissive because they know this isn\u2019t set in stone. But once you get to the second generation, the third generation - the reign of the Kims will be all they know - and they really will think you are a god.\n\nTo successfully run such a utopia, you need to make sure every member of the population believes your story, and your story of the world outside. Everything in North Korean education is brainwashing.\n\nFor most North Koreans, Americans aren\u2019t even human. They\u2019re cold blooded monsters who kill and destroy everything they come across. And to continue your brainwashing you go just a few steps further. You decide everything for them. But that\u2019s not enough. The real control point is keeping people hungry.  \n\nA person who is constantly hungry, the only thing that will be on their mind is where they\u2019ll get their next meal. Contrast that with a well-fed pleb - they\u2019ll have time to think about unproductive things like the meaning of life, the pursuit of happiness, is my dear leader really a God? Things that threaten your power! So it\u2019s very simple - keep. them. hungry. \n\nAs the Supreme Leader of North Korea, you are the world\u2019s foremost example of how a dictator can be the god of the 21st century. Those in the West take freedom for granted. Freedom is hard. Freedom requires responsibility. It requires you to think for yourself, to stand on your own two feet. So to an extent, there\u2019s a part of humanity that naturally wants to be ruled.\n\n-----------------------\nfantompower - Vitamin D https://chll.to/9dca041c\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
