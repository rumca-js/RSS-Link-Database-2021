He also posits that very specific Biblical stories, such as the sojourn in Egypt, Exodus, the conquest of Canaan and the Kingdom of Israel have ample historical evidence if we start looking in Egypt's Middle Kingdom Period.\r\n\r\n Note also that you can now support Not Related! by donating at donate.notrelated.xyz.
