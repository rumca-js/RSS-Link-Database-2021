And how do giraffes get their giraffe-shaped thingies, whatever they are called? Would you believe the answer is\u2026 math? This is the story of a WWII wartime codebreaker and his quest to decode nature\u2019s most beautiful patterns. Alan Turing uncovered a simple code that explains everything from stripes to spots and all the patterns in between\u2026 he was just too far ahead of his time. Only recently have biologists found evidence that his pattern-forming system \n\nAlan Turing\u2019s notes used by permission of King\u2019s College, Cambridge (The Turing Papers collection)\n\nVisit Dr. Natasha Ellison\u2019s Turing Pattern Project to learn more: https://turing-pattern-project.group.shef.ac.uk/ \n\nTuring pattern simulations created using Jason Webb\u2019s Reaction-Diffusion Playground: https://jasonwebb.github.io/reaction-diffusion-playground/ \n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/turing-pattern-references/home \n\nSUBSCRIBE so you don\u2019t miss a video! \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/iotbs_sub\n\n-----------\n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\n\nJoseph Spencer\nBarbora Bei\nKen Board\nClinger-Hamilton Family\nAttila Pix\nBurt Humburg\nDeliciousKashmiri\nBrian Chang\nRoy Lasris\nJavier Soto\ndani bowman\nDavid Johnston\nSalih Arslan\nBaerbel Winkler\nRobert Young\nAmy Sowada\nEric Meer\nDustin\nMarcus Tuepker\nKaren Haskell\nAlecZero\n\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLkCaBwRrVo", "date_published": "2021-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
