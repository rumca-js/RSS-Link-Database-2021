\n\nhttps://sph.umd.edu/news/covid-19-virus-evolving-get-better-becoming-airborne-new-study-shows\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab797/6370149\n\nEpidemiology implicates airborne transmission, aerosol infectiousness \n\nMethods\n\nConfirmed cases gave:\n\nBlood, saliva, mid-turbinate and fomite (phone) swabs\n\n30-minute breath samples while vocalizing\nwith and without masks\n\nUp to two visits two days apart\n\nQuantified and sequenced viral RNA, cultured virus\n\nResults\n\nN = 49 seronegative cases\n\nMean days post onset 3.8 \u00b1 2.1\n\nMay 2020 through April 2021\n\nDetected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in alpha variant\n\n45% of fine (less than 5 \u03bcm) aerosols\n\n31% of coarse ( more than 5 \u03bcm) aerosols\n\n65% of fomite samples\n\nMasks reduced viral RNA by:\n\n48% in fine aerosols\n\n77% in coarse aerosols\n\nCloth and surgical masks were not significantly different\n\nThe alpha variant (compared with earlier viruses)\n\n43-fold increase in fine aerosol viral RNA\n\nRemained a significant 18-fold increase adjusting for viral RNA in saliva, swabs, and other potential confounders\n\nConclusion\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is evolving toward more efficient aerosol generation\n\nLoose-fitting masks provide significant but only modest source control\n\nContinued layered controls and tight-fitting masks and respirators
