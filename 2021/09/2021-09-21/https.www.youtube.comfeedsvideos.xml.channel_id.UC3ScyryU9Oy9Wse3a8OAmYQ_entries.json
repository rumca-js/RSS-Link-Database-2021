But whether your IRA or 401K will assure a safe retirement is largely a gamble. In the 2013 documentary \u201cThe Retirement Gamble,\u201d producers Martin Smith and Marcela Gaviria build off reporting from the groundbreaking series \u201cMoney, Power and Wall Street,\u201d revealing how fees, self-dealing, and kickbacks bring great profits to Wall Street while imperiling the prospects of a secure future for individuals. The documentary explores who has the consumer's best interests in mind, and whether there is a better way to manage our retirements.\n\nLove FRONTLINE?
