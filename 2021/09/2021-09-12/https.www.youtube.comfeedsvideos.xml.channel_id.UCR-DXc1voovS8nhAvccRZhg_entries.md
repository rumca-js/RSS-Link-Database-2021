It's not clickbait if it's the truth.

I bought an AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT. I plugged it into a Raspberry Pi. This is what happened.

I would give you a link to where you can buy one, but... you basically can't. I'm thanking my lucky stars I could buy one at MSRP, because if not, I don't think I'd be able to afford the keyboard I'm typing this on!

If you like what you see, and want me to continue doing insane things with Pis and other devicesâ€”and maybe someday get an external GPU working on the Pi, please consider supporting the channel:
