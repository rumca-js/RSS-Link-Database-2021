They're all strange in their own way, all under the control of one company, and all dating back to old laws and legal documents from a hundred years ago. I was in the area, so I stopped by, and found that things might be changing soon.\n\nREFERENCES:\nManchester Ship Canal Act (1885)\nRixton and Warburton Bridge Act (1863)\n(NOTE: it looks like permission for the toll bridge was set up by the 1863 Act, but that was a different bridge over the River Mersey, and the laws and permissions were transferred over to the Ship Canal when they needed a bigger bridge and it is a complete mess of legal wrangling. As it doesn't affect the final story, I quietly elided that whole section because it was far too dull!)\n\nOther references:\nhttps://moneyweek.com/414922/11-november-1887-work-begins-on-the-manchester-ship-canal\nhttps://hulmesferry.co.uk/\nhttps://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/tiny-manchester-ferry-youve-probably-16391489\nhttps://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/legislation_governing_the_bridge\nhttps://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/387618/response/935840/attach/2/160706%20Rixton%20and%20Warburton%20Bridge%20Act%201863.pdf?cookie_passthrough=1\nhttps://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/14619324.pictures-and-video-everything-you-need-to-know-about-one-of-the-worlds-smallest-ferries-thelwall-penny-ferry/\nhttps://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/19452780.warrington-council-opposes-warburton-toll-bridge-fee-rise/\nhttps://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/19455874.conservative-group-calls-warburton-toll-bridge-inquiry/\nhttps://www.warburtontollbridge.co.uk/download-consultation/\n\nInflation calculator: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator\n\nAnd thanks in particular to Stuart at the Hulmes Ferry for friendly conversation when I arrived!\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\r\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\r\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\r\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVXVNX4Crh4", "date_published": "2021-09-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
