Apple has a lot ahead in terms of scheduled product releases for the end of 2021. When they're coming out, nobody much knows (other than the September iPhone event scheduled for the 14th). What are the new devices going to be, what will be their price points, what features will they offer? A new square flat-edged Series 7 Apple Watch? An iPhone 13 mini with new wide camera and 120Hz ProMotion display with an LTPO 1Hz always-on (AOD) function? New MacBook Pros with an M1X 10-core CPU and 32-core GPU? We break down all the rumors and what they'll mean for you!
