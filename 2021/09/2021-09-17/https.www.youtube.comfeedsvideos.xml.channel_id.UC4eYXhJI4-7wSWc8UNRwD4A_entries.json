Zooming out, the camera reveals the members of Diamante El\u00e9ctrico, accompanied by a colorful 10-piece backing ensemble in their home country's capital, Bogot\u00e1.\n\nDiamante El\u00e9ctrico's brand of Colombian indie rock can be described in three words: funky, inventive and necessary. The Latin Grammy-winning band's music emphasizes community and place \u2014 two things that are displayed front and center as the band takes the stage in the second \"El Tiny\" performance of Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\n\"NO MIEDO!!!\" (no fear) and \"VERDAD\" (truth) adorn the worn-down desks as the collective powers through a politically-charged four-song set. Opening with 2018's \"Rotos,\" they breathe champeta life into their songs through horns and instruments like the guacharaca, played by singer Juan Galeano's brother Mario. They follow with \"Su\u00e9ltame Bogot\u00e1,\" an upbeat plea to escape a suffocating home, and feature a spirited guest performance by Nicolai Fella of LosPetitFellas. \"Amalia\" leads into a genuine expression of thanks and solidarity, as Galeano gives gratitude to those protesting on \"primeras l\u00ednea y segunda l\u00ednea,\" shouting out the students and farmers challenging the government before finishing the set with \"A Veces.\"\n\nIt's why Diamante El\u00e9ctrico has made themselves so crucial, not only in the Latin indie rock scene, but in music at large: the band's tether to its home country is substantial, no matter how fraught it may seem. Through both its music and stage presence, Diamante El\u00e9ctrico curates a shared sense of Latin roots and family, expanding outward from its home of Colombia and resonating across Latinidad, from Puerto Rico to Panama.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Rotos\"\n\"Su\u00e9ltame, Bogot\u00e1\"\n\"Amalia\"\n\"A Veces\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJuan Galeano: vocals\nDaniel \u00c1lvarez Mej\u00eda: guitar, vocals\nAndr\u00e9s Kenguan: wurlitzer\nMario Galeano: loops, guacharaca, delay, cymbals\nMarco Fajardo: saxophone\nSebasti\u00e1n Rozo [EufoX]: euphonium\nDaniel Rinc\u00f3n Ucros: tuba, sousaphone\nJorge \"El Le\u00f3n\" Pardo: trumpet\nPedro Ojeda: percussion\nRoberta Leono: tambor alegre\nAlejandro Cifuentes: bombo\nLafer Angova: vocals\nKaren Castiblanco: vocals\nNicolai Fella: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Andr\u00e9s Kenguan, Santiago Cort\u00e9s, Gustavo Mart\u00ednez\nAudio: Juan Galeano, Mario Galeano\nArrangements: Mario Galeano\nGeneral Production: Ximena Vargas Rocha\nAudio Capture: Pablo Mateus, Fredy Ardila\nCameras: Sebasti\u00e1n Chocont\u00e1, Nicol\u00e1s Melo, Camilo B\u00e1ez, Felipe Ram\u00edrez\nGaffer: Victor Serje\nDirector of Photography: Santiago Cort\u00e9s, Gustavo Mart\u00ednez\nArt Direction: Pigmento Arte, Nathalie Bayona, Carolina Cardona\nProduction Manager: Carla V\u00e1squez\nColor: Jorge Rom\u00e1n Herrera - Crayola Films\nManagement: Criteria Entertainment, M3 Music\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAlt.Latino 'El Tiny' Team: Felix Contreras, Reanna Cruz, Ana\u00efs Laurent, Stefanie Fernandez\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #eltiny #diamanteelectrico", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J5zTLnIqMY", "date_published": "2021-09-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Meet NPR Music's 2021 Tiny Desk Contest Winner", "description": "On Friday, Sept. 17, NPR Music's Bob Boilen interviewed the winner of the 2021 Tiny Desk Contest: Neffy!  \n\nNeffy is a singer-songwriter from Arlington, Va., with a stunning, singular voice whose songs combine influences from folk, soul and R&B.
