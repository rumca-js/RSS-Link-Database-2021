This is a real story about how Atlassian turned the life of Software Engineer into a nightmare, and how they terminated me while I was taking care of my wife who is fighting cancer. This story is about lies, violations of the law, about how desperate and disposable people are in this neo-feudalist organization - Atlassian, and about WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER JOIN ATLASSIAN, AVOID AT ALL COSTS, NEVER USE THEIR SOFTWARE AND RECONSIDER THEM IF YOU'RE ALREADY USING THEIR SOFTWARE.
