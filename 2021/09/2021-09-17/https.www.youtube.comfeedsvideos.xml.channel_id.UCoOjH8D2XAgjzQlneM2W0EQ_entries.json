Leaders from 44 countries met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to decide how the new global economy would run and what it\u2019s financial bedrock would be. The Conference settled on the US Dollar as the de facto global currency. This meant that the paper money printed by one nation was used everywhere.\n\nAfter JFK, the US chose a radically different economic path filled with expensive spending. The one nation the world trusted to uphold the entire financial system was drowning in debt. \n\nNixon changed the very foundation of the global financial system in a total of 16 seconds. By giving the middle finger to countries wanting their gold back, as a \u201ctemporary\u201d measure. \n\nFor the first time in modern history, the world moved from the gold standard, to a global reserve currency not backed by anything at all, just the blind faith that the US dollar was worth something - fiat money. \n\nOPEC, the cartel of Arabic petroleum exporters, announced an embargo on oil sales to the US and the quadrupling of global oil prices.\n\nWhy was this so devastating? Because oil dominated every aspect of Americans\u2019 daily lives. When OPEC exposed this giant weakness in America by restricting their oil supply, the US had to make sure something like this would never happen again.
