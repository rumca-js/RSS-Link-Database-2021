The Halo franchise defined a generation for console gamers. Halo 2 had one of the biggest influences on the shooter space even though it was riddled with glitches. But rather than being rejected or patched, Halo glitches were embraced and became a required skill in the PVP scene and competition. Join Persia as she goes over some of the best glitches that made Halo 2 truly unique with former Halo pro, Eli the Ninja.

In this video, Persia talks about iconic glitches in Halo 2 that added to the skill-ceiling of competitive multiplayer with former Halo pro, Eli the Ninja. From BXR to BXB and more, these unintentional glitches lead to combos that are used far and wide by many Halo 2 players and pros to this day.

With Halo having many different titles within the franchise, Halo 2 stands out due to these glitches and you can still perform them in the Master Chief: Collection’s Halo 2: Classic playlist.

Halo: Infinite is right around the corner after its release date of December 8th, 2021 was confirmed by Microsoft at Gamescom Opening Night Live and is now available for pre-order. You can check out our pre-order guide on gamespot.com.
