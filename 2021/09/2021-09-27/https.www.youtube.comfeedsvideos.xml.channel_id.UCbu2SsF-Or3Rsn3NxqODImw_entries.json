Many of the game's trailers so far have featured the long-limbed, quadripedal robots known as EMMIs, who seem to be near impossible-to-kill sentries that series protagonist Samus Aran must simply avoid. EMMIs--or at least one version of them--are there right from the start of your adventure, and during my recent hands-on playthrough of the game's opening sector, EMMIs proved to be an effective, compelling way of instilling a healthy amount of panic to the series' tried-and-true core of action and exploration.\n\n#metroiddread #metroid", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9LZ2sSnHM", "date_published": "2021-09-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New World - Everything You Need To Know", "description": "New World is an MMORPG from Amazon Games releasing exclusively on PC on September 28, 2021.Shipwrecked on the island of Aeternum, it is up to the player to uncover secrets, harvest Azoth and keep control of the island from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nNew World is an MMORPG from Amazon Games set on the mythical island of Aeternum.

From the humble beginnings of 1942 to EA's upcoming Battlefield 2042, we break down the history of Battlefield and its legacy over the years.\n\nBattlefield has released several games over the last two decades as one of the most recognizable franchises in the video game industry. With Battlefield 2042 just around the corner, now is the perfect time to take a look at the History of Battlefield. In this video, we'll start from the beginning with Battlefield 1942, and how it set such a significant foundation for future Battlefield games to build off of.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield has an emphasis on land, air, and sea combat, creating a series that relishes chaotic and exciting gameplay, eventually expanding upon the core Conquest mode with other ways for players to engage each other. Every Battlefield game is notable in its own way, but Bad Company 2, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield 1 are standouts for various reasons, whether it's a greater emphasis on campaign modes, or taking the Battlefield destruction capabilities with the Frostbite engines to an all-time high.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 is slated to release on October 22, 2021, on Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PS4, PS5, and PC. The game will increase the size of Battlefield matches to a massive 128 players, with customizable load-outs and the incorporation of brand new Specialists in place of character classes. We\u2019ll have so much more to break down with Battlefield 2042 in the coming days, so stay tuned!\n\n#battlefield #battlefield2042", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVii2aNhWUo", "date_published": "2021-09-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
