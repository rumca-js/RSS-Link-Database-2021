In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about the massive popularity of New World causing problems for the game’s servers, Battlefield 2042 beta details, and Halo Infinite’s next beta being open to everyone on Xbox and friend’s of current Halo Insiders. 

New World, Amazon Game Studios' long-delayed MMO, is finally live, and it has quickly become the #2 game on Steam with more than 700,000 concurrent players and counting. Due to this, the game is experiencing overloaded servers that is causing long queue times. The game is also seeing massive popularity on Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. Currently, more than 750,000 people are watching New World on the platform, and those watching certain channels and who link their Steam accounts can earn Twitch drops for in-game items.

EA and DICE have officially announced the open beta dates for Battlefield 2042 and the beta officially begins on October 8, but people who preorder or subscribe to EA Play can start two days early, beginning October 6. Since EA Play is bundled with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, subscribers to Microsoft's service can start on October 6 as well. Many other features including progression, cosmetics, and more will also be available during the open beta. 

Xbox users can get access to the upcoming Halo Infinite multiplayer beta by downloading the Xbox Insider Hub app, which is free to download. Current Halo Insiders will also receive a “friend code” that can be redeemed for access to the beta on PC or Xbox.

The Nintendo Switch OLED version will release on October 8, and we recently got a chance to finally spend some time playing with the new device.

The new Nintendo Switch OLED is almost out, with its release date of October 8 only a matter of days away. I recently got some hands-on time with this new version during a preview session with the upcoming Metroid Dread, and I'm sure the question you're all asking is the same. Is the Nintendo Switch OLED version, which at $350 is $50 more expensive than the base Switch version, worth it?

We went hands-on with the first sector of Metroid Dread and it's clear there will be a lot of tense moments with nearly indestructible EMMIs hunting you. Dread releases in October on Nintendo Switch.

Metroid Dread doesn't waste any time in introducing what exactly there is to dread in the long-awaited sequel. Many of the game's trailers so far have featured the long-limbed, quadripedal robots known as EMMIs, who seem to be near impossible-to-kill sentries that series protagonist Samus Aran must simply avoid. EMMIs--or at least one version of them--are there right from the start of your adventure, and during my recent hands-on playthrough of the game's opening sector, EMMIs proved to be an effective, compelling way of instilling a healthy amount of panic to the series' tried-and-true core of action and exploration.

## The History Of Battlefield

Battlefield is one of the most iconic FPS games of the past few decades. From the humble beginnings of 1942 to EA's upcoming Battlefield 2042, we break down the history of Battlefield and its legacy over the years.

Battlefield has released several games over the last two decades as one of the most recognizable franchises in the video game industry. With Battlefield 2042 just around the corner, now is the perfect time to take a look at the History of Battlefield. In this video, we'll start from the beginning with Battlefield 1942, and how it set such a significant foundation for future Battlefield games to build off of. 

Battlefield has an emphasis on land, air, and sea combat, creating a series that relishes chaotic and exciting gameplay, eventually expanding upon the core Conquest mode with other ways for players to engage each other. Every Battlefield game is notable in its own way, but Bad Company 2, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield 1 are standouts for various reasons, whether it's a greater emphasis on campaign modes, or taking the Battlefield destruction capabilities with the Frostbite engines to an all-time high. 

Battlefield 2042 is slated to release on October 22, 2021, on Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PS4, PS5, and PC. The game will increase the size of Battlefield matches to a massive 128 players, with customizable load-outs and the incorporation of brand new Specialists in place of character classes. We’ll have so much more to break down with Battlefield 2042 in the coming days, so stay tuned!
