This episode of SciShow is brought to you in partnership with Gates Notes. Head to https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/New-breakthroughs-in-Alzheimers-diagnostics to learn more about some of the latest breakthroughs in creating reliable, affordable, and accessible Alzheimer’s Diagnostics. 

To learn more about Alzheimer's head to: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-2004807. To find a clinical trial, head to: https://www.alzheimers.gov/clinical-trials

Alzheimer’s is a devastating form of dementia, but we maybe one step closer to finding a way to catching it earlier.

## Detecting Earthquakes: AI vs. Citizen Scientists

There are over 13,000 active seismic stations out there, producing far more data than seismologists have time to go through. So, researchers set up a showdown of humans versus machines to sift through all this information and, in the process, crown the heavyweight earthquake detection champion.

The project we described in this video has ended, but many scientists recruit for citizen science projects over at https://www.zooniverse.org/.

There’s also the Did You Feel It project, where anyone who feels a rumble can fill out a quick survey and report it to the US Geological Survey: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/dyfi/.
