COVID bounce back, based on PCR and LFT test data

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-bounces-back-as-cases-start-to-rise

Based on PCR and LFT test data

7th to 21st August 2021

Around one million weekly contributors

25,876 recent swab tests

Symptomatic cases in fully vaccinated (UK), 29.4% of the total new daily cases

Our data shows post-vaccination infections are much more like a cold than the flu, with the top symptoms being runny nose, headache, sneezing, sore throat and loss of smell. 

We’re again calling on the government to add these cold-like symptoms to their list to help educate the public and catch more cases

New cases are highest in the 18-35 age groups

Followed by the 0-18 year olds

Prevalence

On average 1 in 100 people in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID

UK R value is 1.1 (Scotland, 1.2)

Long covid

Estimated that 870 cases a day will go on to experience symptoms for longer than 12 weeks

Probability of long COVID is much lower than the previous wave

Probability of contracting long COVID is much higher in younger people

Driven by the fact that more young people are contracting COVID now compared to older 
generations

Professor Tim Spector

Unfortunately, we’re back in a position where cases, hospitalisations and deaths are all going up and the UK has the highest rates of COVID in Europe, despite our superior vaccination rates. 

The main difference between the UK and Europe is our lack of restrictions. In many parts of Europe, people are still wearing face coverings and observing some social distancing. 

In the UK, where we eagerly declared ‘freedom’ from COVID and did away with even the most basic social measures, COVID has found an opportunity to spread. 

As kids head back to the classrooms, there’s a good chance cases will continue to rise from here.

UK, (England), Risk of thrombocytopenia and thromboembolism after covid-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 positive testing: self-controlled case series study

Prof Julia Hippisley-Cox

People vaccinated with first doses, 16 or over

N = 29,121,633

Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19)

N = 19,608,008

Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2mRNA)

N = 9,513,625

People testing positive SARSCoV-2

N = 1,758,095

Within 28 days of three exposures

First dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine

First dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine

SARS-CoV-2 positive test

For every 10 million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca

An extra 107 would be hospitalised or die from thrombocytopenia

(1 in 93,459)

9 times lower than the risk following an infection

An extra 66 would be hospitalised or die from blood clots in the veins

Nearly 200 times lower than the risk following an infection

For every 10 million people vaccinated with the Pfizer

An extra 143 extra strokes would be seen

(1 in 69,930)

12 times lower than the risk following an infection

Myocarditis and pericarditis

Chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e2.htm

52 million doses to 12–29 years

1,226 reports of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination 42,414

One in 42,414

Data demonstrate increased risks, particularly within the seven days following the second dose
 
The observed risk is higher among males under 40 years of age compared to females and older males

Risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age
