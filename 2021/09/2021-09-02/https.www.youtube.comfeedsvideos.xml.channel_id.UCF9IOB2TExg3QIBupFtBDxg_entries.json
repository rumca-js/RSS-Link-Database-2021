In many parts of Europe, people are still wearing face coverings and observing some social distancing. \n\nIn the UK, where we eagerly declared \u2018freedom\u2019 from COVID and did away with even the most basic social measures, COVID has found an opportunity to spread. \n\nAs kids head back to the classrooms, there\u2019s a good chance cases will continue to rise from here.\n\n\nUK data\n\nhttps://coronavirus.data.gov.uk\n\nUnited States data\n\nhttps://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases\n\nhttps://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends\n\nhttps://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_d7OLO_2nE", "date_published": "2021-09-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Interview on the NHS in the UK", "description": "A short interview for those intrested in the NHS and the philisopichal approach to health care", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2HNp42rz9I", "date_published": "2021-09-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Risks following infection versus vaccination", "description": "UK, (England), Risk of thrombocytopenia and thromboembolism after covid-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 positive testing: self-controlled case series study\n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1931\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-58347434\n\nProf Julia Hippisley-Cox\n\nPeople vaccinated with first doses, 16 or over\n\nN = 29,121,633\n\nOxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19)\n\nN = 19,608,008\n\nPfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2mRNA)\n\nN = 9,513,625\n\nPeople testing positive SARSCoV-2\n\nN = 1,758,095\n\nWithin 28 days of three exposures\n\nFirst dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine\n\nFirst dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine\n\nSARS-CoV-2 positive test\n\nFor every 10 million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca\n\nAn extra 107 would be hospitalised or die from thrombocytopenia\n\n(1 in 93,459)\n\n9 times lower than the risk following an infection\n\nAn extra 66 would be hospitalised or die from blood clots in the veins\n\nNearly 200 times lower than the risk following an infection\n\nFor every 10 million people vaccinated with the Pfizer\n\nAn extra 143 extra strokes would be seen\n\n(1 in 69,930)\n\n12 times lower than the risk following an infection\n\nMyocarditis and pericarditis\n\nChest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-june-25-2021\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e2.htm\n\n52 million doses to 12\u201329 years\n\n1,226 reports of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination 42,414\n\nOne in 42,414\n\nData demonstrate increased risks, particularly within the seven days following the second dose\n \nThe observed risk is higher among males under 40 years of age compared to females and older males\n\nRisk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk4UoAkLaDU", "date_published": "2021-09-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
