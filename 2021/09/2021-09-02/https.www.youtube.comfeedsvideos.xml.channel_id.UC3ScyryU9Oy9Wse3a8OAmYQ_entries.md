In the 2004 documentary “Losing Iraq”, FRONTLINE filmmakers Michael Kirk, Jim Gilmore and Mike Wiser explore the key political stories behind the Iraq war’s defining moments: from the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein, through the violent rise of ISIS. Drawing on one of the richest archives in broadcast journalism — including more than 40 reports on the war on terror — as well as in-depth interviews with policymakers and military leaders, FRONTLINE examines the U.S. role starting from the 2003 invasion.
