Today I have my early review of the KatWalk C, the first and only CONSUMER level and priced VR omni-directional treadmill.. well actually its much more like a \"slidemill\". It took a bit of getting used to but using this slidemill has completely changed the way I look at VR, VR gaming, and VR social cases. It really is probably my favorite peripheral hardware I have ever used (besides maybe full body trackers I suppose). So far I've been loving it and I hope you enjoy my review! Of course there are negatives which I talk about, especially the price at $1400, but still.. it's a ton of fun.\n\nMy links:\nJoin in my discord server:\nDiscord.gg/Thrill\n\nCheck out my streams:\nTwitch.tv/Thrilluwu\n\nOutro music:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3zSiHJI0ZCidNR8ygDXQGh?si=b374bab1eed244e0\n\nKatWalk C:\nhttps://www.kat-vr.com/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zuLwLLHY0", "date_published": "2021-09-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
