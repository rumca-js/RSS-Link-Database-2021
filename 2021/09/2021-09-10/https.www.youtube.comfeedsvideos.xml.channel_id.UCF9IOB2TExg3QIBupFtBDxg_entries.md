Zinc and immune function: the biological basis of altered resistance to infection

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9701160/

Zinc is known to play a central role in the immune system

and zinc-deficient persons experience increased susceptibility to a variety of pathogens

It is clear that zinc affects multiple aspects of the immune system

Zinc is crucial for normal development and function of cells mediating nonspecific immunity such as neutrophils and natural killer cells

Zinc deficiency also affects development of acquired immunity, activation of  T lymphocytes and B lymphocyte help

B lymphocyte development and antibody production, particularly immunoglobulin G, is compromised

The macrophage, is adversely affected by zinc deficiency

Zinc is needed by these key immunologic mediators

Basic cellular functions such as DNA replication

RNA transcription, cell division, and cell activation

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01712/full

Zinc deficiency results in altered numbers and dysfunction of all immune cells

Suboptimal zinc states have an increased risk for infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancer

Risk groups for zinc deficiency

Malnutrition

Elderly and patients with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases

Mild zinc deficiency is largely sub-clinical,

it is unnoticed in most people

World Health Organization

Assumes that at least one third of the world population is affected by zinc deficiency

Zinc deficiency is responsible for 16% of all deep respiratory infections world-wide

Supplementation, for which minimal to no side effects are known.

Europe 10 to 20% zinc deficiency

Zinc Protects the Human Body From Entering of the Virus

Essential for tissue barriers equipped with cilia and mucus, anti-microbial peptides like lysozymes and interferons

The expression of tight junction proteins was found to be zinc-dependent

Mucociliar clearance of viruses is affected by zinc

Physiological concentrations of zinc increase ciliary beat frequency

Zinc-dependent alterations in gene expression by pneumocytes

Associations with interferons

Zinc Directly Inhibits Viral Replication

Direct antiviral effects of zinc have been demonstrated

E.g. coronaviridae, picornavirus, papilloma virus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the hepatitis C virus

It was suggested that zinc can prevent fusion with the host membrane

Decreases the viral polymerase function

Blocks viral particle release

Destabilizes the viral envelope

Zinc Balances the Immune Response During Infectious Diseases

Hyper-inflammation, immune products including pro-inflammatory cytokines

Movement and over activation of immune cells to the lungs

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

Need of zinc for lymphocyte development and function and that zinc supplementation can reverse lymphopenia

Zinc is indispensable in the signal cascade of the T cell receptor and as a second messenger

Zinc is required for B cell maturation and function 

Zinc Supplementation in Respiratory Infections

A row of successful supplementation studies focusing on respiratory tract infection

In most cases, prophylactic zinc supplementation was more effective than therapeutic proceedings

Studies showed reduced symptom severity, reduced frequency, and duration of the common cold after zinc administration

Zinc supplementation of children in developing countries

Reduced pneumonia-specific morality by 15%

and 19% of pneumonia morbidity by 19%

Risk Groups and Symptoms of COVID-19 and Zinc Deficiency Reveal a Large Overlap

Low serum zinc levels are regularly observed in:

COPD, bronchial asthma, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, kidney diseases, dialysis, obesity, diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis, liver cirrhosis, immunosuppression, and known liver damage 

57.5% elderly and nursing home residents in the U.S., showed significantly decreased zinc intake

Zinc supplementation was able to reconstitute immune function in elderly and zinc deficient individuals

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7482607/

(Journal of infectious diseases)

The study data clearly show that a significant number of COVID-19 patients were zinc deficient. These zinc deficient patients developed more complications, and the deficiency was associated with a prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality.

Foods containing zinc

Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)

https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-982/zinc

Boys and men age 14 and older, 11 mg/day

Women 19 and older, 8 mg/day

Pregnant women 11 to 18 mg / day

Lactating women 12 to 14 Mg/day

COVID cases no longer climbing as feared, except Scotland 

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-cases-no-longer-climbing-as-feared

https://covid.joinzoe.com/data#levels-over-time

Data from 21st August to 4th September 

COVID cases no longer climbing as feared

Current cases, + 51,876 (symptomatic) 

Based on PCR and LFT test data from up to five days ago, n = 31,075

Down 9.2% from 57,158 new daily cases last week

In the fully vaccinated population

Cases, + 17,674 (symptomatic)

(Last week’s average, + 17,342)

New cases are the highest among the 0-18 and 18–35 year-old

On average 1 in 90 people in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID

UK R value = 1.0

Wales, 1.1

Scotland, 1.1

Scotland and England

Cases remain highest in 0-19 years old

Longer covid

894 people a day will go on to experience symptoms for longer than 12 weeks

Professor Tim Spector

It’s great to see the return to schools and summer festivals haven’t yet resulted in a spike in cases as feared. 

Worse in Scotland, rates are still rising

Scottish hospitals could soon be overwhelmed

The Scottish situation makes it clear we can’t be complacent about COVID as winter approaches

We are still producing far too many Long Covid cases and hospitalisations unnecessarily

For 521 days, ZOE and King’s College London have demanded cold and flu-like symptoms be recognised as common COVID-19 symptoms

UK rates the highest in Europe, if the government continues with no restrictions, 

surely we should at least help people to recognise the symptoms early and know when to stay at home

US vaccine mandates, All businesses with more than 100 employees

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vaccine-mandate-federal-employees/2021/09/09/1c1ce9dc-116b-11ec-882f-2dd15a067dc4_story.html

80 million workers

Up to $14,000 per violation

Immunized or face weekly testing

Signed an executive order compelling all federal employees to get vaccinated

(no testing op out)

All staffers in Head Start programs

Defense Department

Federally operated schools for Native Americans

We’re in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while

What makes it incredibly more frustrating is we have the tools to combat covid-19, 

and a distinct minority of Americans, supported by a distinct minority of elected officials, are keeping us from turning the corner

We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin

And your refusal has cost all of us

These ‘pandemic politics,’ as I refer to it, are making people sick, causing unvaccinated people to die

We cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting a large majority of Americans who have done their part

Right now local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic, 

while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs

UK, 49% for mandating

40% against

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-mandate-work-poll-americans-favor/

US, The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research

59% of remote workers favor vaccine requirements in their own workplaces

47% of those who are currently working in person
