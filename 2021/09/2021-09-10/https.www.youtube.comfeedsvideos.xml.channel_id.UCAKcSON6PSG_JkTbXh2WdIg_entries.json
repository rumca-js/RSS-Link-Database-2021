Sutton will be setting music aside to spend more time with his visual art and with his wife and their young daughter. But as he declared in his Instagram posts about his departure, Sutton leaves with a lot of memories. There certainly have been a lot of great memories just at The Current when it comes to JD McPherson \u2014 including a number of in-studio sessions \u2014 plus these two lively performances recorded at Rock the Garden 2015.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Firebug\"\n2:30 \"Let The Good Times Roll\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nJD McPherson \u2013 vocals, guitar\nDoug Corcoran \u2013 saxophone, guitar, xylophone, backing vocals\nRay Jacildo \u2013 piano, organ, backing vocals\nJason Smay \u2013 drums \nJimmy Sutton \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Teddy Wolff\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Corey Schreppel\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; Brett Baldwin\n\nFIND MORE:\n2012 July studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/07/06/jd-mcpherson-performs-in-the-current-studios\n2012 November studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/11/29/jd-mcpherson-live\n2014 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/09/14/jd-mcpherson-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2015 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/02/14/jd-mcpherson-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2015 Rock the Garden set:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/07/01/jd-mcpherson-live-at-rock-the-garden-2015\n2018 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/12/04/jd-mcpherson-and-band-pull-up-their-socks-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#jdmcpherson", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJo8WOazRYY", "date_published": "2021-09-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "John Mark Nelson - three songs for The Current (2012, 2013, 2015)", "description": "Six years ago this week, John Mark Nelson performed in The Current studio in a session recorded for The Local Show.
