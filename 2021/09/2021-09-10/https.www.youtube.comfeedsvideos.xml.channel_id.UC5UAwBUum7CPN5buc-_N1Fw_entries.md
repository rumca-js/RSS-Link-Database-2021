10:58 Slimbook Titan or Stellaris 15?

## The laptop

So, the Tuxedo Stellaris 15 is, obviously,  15 inch laptop. It weighs 2.2kg, battery included, and it's probably the highest end laptop Tuxedo offers these days, at least for anything requiring some serious horsepower.

My review unit came with 16Gb of RAM, as well as an Nvidia Geforce RTX 3070, as well as 256GB of SSD.

THe display is one of the major focus point of this laptop: it's a 3K panel, at 2560x1440p, running at 165hz. It's got amazing viewing angles, really good color accuracy, and seeing as this laptop is definitely made for creatives or gamers, it's a fantastic display.

The chassis itself is the same as what the SLimbook Titan uses: fully made out of black aluminium, except for the bottom plate, which is removeable and lets you access the RAM, the SSD as well as the battery, that you can upgrade and replace.

Tuxedo's branding is more subtle than the one on the Slimbook Titan, with a black TUxedo logo on the back, slightly raised, and that's it. No big logo underneath the screen, which is definitely a good thing, and no stickers on the chassis either.

We also find here the excellent opto-mechanical keyboard: a mechanical board that uses light instead of switches to actuate the keys. 

The touchpad is really good as well, made out of glass, super smooth, very reactive, and large enough to be comfortable. Definitely a good touchpad as far a laptops preinstalled with Linux go.

You get a USB 3.1 gen 2 port, an audio and a microphone jack on the left side, as well as a full size SD card reader and 2 USB 3.1 ports on the right side. On the back, you have a thunderbolt 4 port, since I went with the intel option, with video out for up to 2 4K displays, an HDMI 2.1 port, a gigabit ethernet jack, and the barrel charger on the back. 

## Performance

Ok, so here is where the laptop really diverges from the Slimbook Titan I reviewed. The Tuxedo Stellaris 15 I got has an intel Core i7 11800H, which is an 8 core, 16 threads CPU, that can go up to 4.6Ghz, with a base clock of 2.3Ghz, slightly lower than the base clock of the Ryzen 9 5900HX I reviewed on the SLimbook Titan, but with 24Mb of L3 cache, versus the 16 of the ryzen option.

Both CPUs have the same 45W TDP, so let's see how they compare.

The Core i7 on the Stellaris 15 got a single core score of **1669**, and a multi core score of **8487**, when in "max performance" mode.

This is surprisingly higher than the scores for the Ryzen 9 5900HX I tried on the Slimbook Titan, which got 1511 in single core, and 8170 in multi core. That's about a 10% improvement in single core, and 4% in multi core.

So, basically, these 11th Gen CPUs get a 20 to 50% performance edge, on these 3 games at least, compared to the Ryzen 9 5900HX. That is super surprising to me, especially considering that the intel CPUs should have a lower base clock, and the geekbench scores don't really reflect that kind of difference. I have to believe that this is due to some performance profile that wasn't enabled on the Slimbook Titan, these CPUs shouldn't result in such massive differences.


On the intel device, you don't get that problem, and running the laptop without using the Nvidia dedicated GPU at all, with 50% screen brightness, I got 7 hours, just watching youtube videos on a loop in Firefox.
