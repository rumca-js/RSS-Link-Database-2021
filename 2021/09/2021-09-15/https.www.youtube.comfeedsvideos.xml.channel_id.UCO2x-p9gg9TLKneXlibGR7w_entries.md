The rumor mill was 100% off this time. Basically nothing rumored ended up coming to fruition. The squared-edge Apple Watch Series 7 was a sham, the astrophotography, satellite, and always-on displays rumored for the iPhone 13 series were nowhere to be seen, and the iPad mini... okay, well the iPad mini rumors were pretty spot on. But the event was a little weird. Apple wan't 100% straight up about the A15 SoC, the SoC present in the Apple Watch Series 7 (spoiler alert: it's the same as the Series 6), and some of their marketing copy is downright shady. In this video, I break down everything you need to know about the Apple September 2021 iPhone event.
