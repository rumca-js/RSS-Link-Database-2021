for further evidence to emerge on the duration of immunity against COVID-19\n\nPossibly broader, longer peaks than those originally estimated\n\nPotential for another large wave of hospitalisations\n\nIncreasing cases remain the earliest warning sign that hospital admissions are likely to rise\n\nClear consensus that continued high levels of homeworking has played a very important role in preventing sustained epidemic growth\n\nHighly likely that a significant decrease in homeworking in the next few months would result in a rapid increase in hospital admissions\n\nIf

to be consistent across age groups\n\nIf those at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 take greater precautions, \n\nlevels of hospital admissions and deaths could be lower than those seen in the Roadmap modelling \n\nVaccine effectiveness estimates continue to be refined\n\nThere is now evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness particularly 140 days after the second dose\n\nThose individuals vaccinated in late 2020 and early 2021 will have less protection in the coming months\n\nThird doses and booster vaccinations, which are able to reverse waning of protection, will limit
