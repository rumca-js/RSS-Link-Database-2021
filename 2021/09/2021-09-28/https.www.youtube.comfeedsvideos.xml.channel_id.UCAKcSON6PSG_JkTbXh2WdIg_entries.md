This week, Mary Lucia shares the story of finding an exhibit in New York featuring the work of a person she calls "the greatest living painter," Julian Schnabel.

"There was a show of exclusively his broken-plate paintings at the Brant Museum in the East Village," Mary says. "And it was like — jackpot!"

Watch Mary's video above to learn more about Schnabel and about the Brant Foundation's exhibit, and to see photos of the gallery of Schnabel's work.
