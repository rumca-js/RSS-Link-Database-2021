So with all the N64 love in the air, we\u2019re looking back for that quick hit of nostalgia to decide the best games on the N64.\n\nIn this video, we go over the best games that the Nintendo 64 had to offer over its entire lifetime. From the weirdness of Grunty\u2019s Lair in Banjo-Kazooie to the space adventure of Starfox 64, the 64 era was filled with classic worlds to discover and explore. Not only that, but with games like Super Mario 64, the N64 helped to define what 3D gaming could become. Even more, games like Mario Kart 64 set the template for long-running series that have dominated entire genres.\n\nFor this ranking, we look at everything from the multiplayer madness of Goldeneye 007 to the dark themes of Majora\u2019s Mask to the horrors of Resident Evil 2\u2026 and it\u2019s graphics. Even further, we highlight some underappreciated gems like Conker\u2019s Bad Fur Day\u2026 though we hope you\u2019ll forgive us if we forget to talk about Superman 64.\u00a0\n\nIf you want to see how you can replay some of these nostalgic games, check out the news about N64 games, as well as some Sega Genesis classics, will be coming to Nintendo Switch Online later this year here!\n\n#n64 #nintendo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhi0HTvXTs", "date_published": "2021-09-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Battlefield 2042 Open Beta Trailer", "description": "Be among the first to experience the next generation of all-out warfare in the Battlefield 2042 Open Beta.
