Hope you like the new intro! Today is ENTIRELY VR hardware news. Trust me when I say this, the next few months of VR hardware is about to be insane. SO MANY HEADSETS and SO MUCH HARDWARE, from Arpara, Oculus, Valve, Pimax, and so much more. We have so much to look forward to if you're getting tired of your current headset! 

I will be on Twitch demoing the XR3 today, come join!
