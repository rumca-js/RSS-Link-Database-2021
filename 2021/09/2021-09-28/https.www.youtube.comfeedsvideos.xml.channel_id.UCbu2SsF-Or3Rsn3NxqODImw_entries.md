The Nintendo 64 is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year and it’s getting a lot of love from Nintendo, with their Nintendo Switch Online expanding to include classic N64 games like Super Mario 64, Starfox 64 and the Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. So with all the N64 love in the air, we’re looking back for that quick hit of nostalgia to decide the best games on the N64.

In this video, we go over the best games that the Nintendo 64 had to offer over its entire lifetime. From the weirdness of Grunty’s Lair in Banjo-Kazooie to the space adventure of Starfox 64, the 64 era was filled with classic worlds to discover and explore. Not only that, but with games like Super Mario 64, the N64 helped to define what 3D gaming could become. Even more, games like Mario Kart 64 set the template for long-running series that have dominated entire genres.

For this ranking, we look at everything from the multiplayer madness of Goldeneye 007 to the dark themes of Majora’s Mask to the horrors of Resident Evil 2… and it’s graphics. Even further, we highlight some underappreciated gems like Conker’s Bad Fur Day… though we hope you’ll forgive us if we forget to talk about Superman 64. 

If you want to see how you can replay some of these nostalgic games, check out the news about N64 games, as well as some Sega Genesis classics, will be coming to Nintendo Switch Online later this year here!

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about the massive popularity of New World causing problems for the game’s servers, Battlefield 2042 beta details, and Halo Infinite’s next beta being open to everyone on Xbox and friend’s of current Halo Insiders. 

New World, Amazon Game Studios' long-delayed MMO, is finally live, and it has quickly become the #2 game on Steam with more than 700,000 concurrent players and counting. Due to this, the game is experiencing overloaded servers that is causing long queue times. The game is also seeing massive popularity on Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. Currently, more than 750,000 people are watching New World on the platform, and those watching certain channels and who link their Steam accounts can earn Twitch drops for in-game items.

EA and DICE have officially announced the open beta dates for Battlefield 2042 and the beta officially begins on October 8, but people who preorder or subscribe to EA Play can start two days early, beginning October 6. Since EA Play is bundled with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, subscribers to Microsoft's service can start on October 6 as well. Many other features including progression, cosmetics, and more will also be available during the open beta. 

Xbox users can get access to the upcoming Halo Infinite multiplayer beta by downloading the Xbox Insider Hub app, which is free to download. Current Halo Insiders will also receive a “friend code” that can be redeemed for access to the beta on PC or Xbox.

The Nintendo Switch OLED version will release on October 8, and we recently got a chance to finally spend some time playing with the new device.

The new Nintendo Switch OLED is almost out, with its release date of October 8 only a matter of days away. I recently got some hands-on time with this new version during a preview session with the upcoming Metroid Dread, and I'm sure the question you're all asking is the same. Is the Nintendo Switch OLED version, which at $350 is $50 more expensive than the base Switch version, worth it?
