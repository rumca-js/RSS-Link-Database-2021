Adia Victoria's "A Southern Gothic" is our Album of the Week. We've enjoyed a recent virtual session with Adia Victoria, and here are three live performances by Victoria in 2019 as part of Live From Here, recorded live at the Filene Center for the Performing Arts in Vienna, Va. The first song is from Adia Victoria's 2016 album, "Beyond the Bloodhounds" and the second and third songs are from 2019's "Silences."
