Kena: Bridge of Spirits' combat can be deceptively difficult, but we pull off the first minor boss fight on the hardest difficulty without taking damage.

In the video, the game is set to Master Spirit Guide, the hardest difficulty in the game, setting rules such as losing courage when getting hit, enemies becoming much more aggressive, and enemies dealing more damage. We conquer the first minor boss in this mode with no HUD and no damage taken to up the ante. Master Spirit Guide only unlocks once you've beaten the game.

Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a gorgeous-looking game especially in 4k. Here are the first 20 minutes on the PlayStation 5 which showcases Kena's staff in action, meeting adorable Rot creatures, and learn about the world. We explore the opening area, find treasures, solve a puzzle, and fight our way through some enemies to embark on our journey.

In Bridge of Spirits, you play as Kena, a spirit guide on a personal quest that sees her stumbling upon a deserted village. The village and its surrounding areas are full of the spirits of the people who once lived there, many of whom can't move on as a result of their individual traumas. Kena's goal lies beyond the village, but she'll only be able to reach it if she helps the spirits she encounters.

Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a third person action-adventure game created by Ember Lab. You'll play as Kena, a young spirit guide who uses her magical abilities to help deceased people move from the physical to the spirit world. 

Kena Bridge of Spirits releases on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and PC through the Epic Game Store on September 21, 2021.

## Kena: Bridge of Spirits Review

Though it relies on familiar combat and exploration mechanics, Kena: Bridge of Spirits gives a new perspective through its beautiful art direction, emotional story, and super-cute Rot companions.

Kena: Bridge of Spirits is, in some ways, a familiar action-adventure game. You'll see similarities in it from the likes of titles such as Okami, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and a host of other titles in the genre. But developer Ember Studios does a great job of giving a new look on the familiar throughout the game, both to tell the deep and emotional story of a spirit guide helping traumatized ghosts move on from this world, and in how it uses gameplay for some deceptively tough combat and smart puzzles.

You play as Kena, a spirit guide trying to find out what has happened in the area around an abandoned village, where all the inhabitants have fallen to tragedy. The pained spirits have been twisted by what has happened to them, causing the land around the village to be poisoned by a spreading corruption. Kena's role as a spirit guide is to help heal those ghosts, and to do that, you have to fight their twisted forms with a combination of melee attacks, dodges, and parries.

But you also have access to the Rot, a group of tiny spirit companions who change up everything about the way Kena plays. The Rot can be used in battle to distract enemies or to power up Kena's special spirit energy attacks. They also work together with your combat abilities to make most fights feel like a puzzle to be solved. The Rot are essential to destroying the poisoned hearts that spread the corruption, and you'll need to think tactically to deploy them at the right time, and in the right way, to defeat Kena's tough enemies and bosses.

With a big world to explore, lots of innovative puzzles to solve with the abilities of both Kena and the Rot, and some excellently designed boss fights, Kena does a lot to stand apart from similar action-adventure games. Its combination of story and mechanics make it a beautiful journey to take. For more, check out our full written Kena: Bridge of Spirits review.

With game development grinding to a halt in 2020, anticipated titles like Battlefield 2042, GhostWire: Tokyo, God of War: Ragnarok, and several more have all been delayed. Here's our list even more games that have been delayed in 2021.

Game development for most of 2020 came to a screeching halt with the wake of the global pandemic. Even into 2021, the wave of delayed games grew by the day, with developers transitioning to their work-from-home environments. As companies continue to regain their momentum, some delays were only temporarily, while some have yet to receive updates. 

Richie Bracamonte is here to break down the laundry list of titles that have been delayed in 2021. Games from just about every category are present from the Warhammer series to more recent entries like Battlefield 2024. Titles that were announced in 2021 that were set for a 2022 release (Diablo 4, Overwatch 2) will not be mentioned on this list.

All of these delays are of course subject to change. As the world continues to adjust from new workspaces, only time will tell if these dates will stick. Stay tuned to GameSpot for the latest news regarding these titles and more.
