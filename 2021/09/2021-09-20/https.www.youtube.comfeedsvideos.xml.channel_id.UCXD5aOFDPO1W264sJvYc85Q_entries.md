After reading Robert Greene's "48 Laws of Power" and a few other books on the subject, I decided to incorporate what I learned into this video and have the lessons spoken through the character of an old king. I hope this provides a fun and entertaining way to learn some of the universal concepts of power and how to rule over your chosen domain.
