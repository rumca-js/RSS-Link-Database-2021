Their local celebrity was enough to justify the commissioning of this film, which is almost a home movie, yet was screened for the public, as well as the family, in April 1902.\n\nIn 1890 Tranby Croft had been the scene of a baccarat cheating scandal which fascinated Victorian society because of the involvement of the then Prince of Wales - by this time King Edward VII. Clive Wilson's father, Arthur Wilson, was a friend of the Prince and hosted the party, which all perhaps helps further explain the profile they are given in this film. Tranby Croft is now the site of a school.\n\nBFI:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-lieutenant-clive-wilson-and-tranby-croft-party-1902-1902-online\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
