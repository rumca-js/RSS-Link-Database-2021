[RE: ANGRY COMMENTS:]
My intention with that "temporary ban" bit of the video isn't to call for full-on censorship. That's nuts. I was trying (and I guess failing) to express that those weird "12-hour suspensions" that Twitter does, literally don't do anything. They've performative-- so that they can then say they're doing something about disinformation.

I can see how making fun of temporary bans could imply that permanent bans were the go-to solution, and I could have been clearer in writing that bit. The point is: I don't know what the solution is to the very complicated issue of disinformation, but time-outs aren't it- and I wanted to poke fun at that.  Next video will be about farts or something.
