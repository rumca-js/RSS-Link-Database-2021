VR is something that has always fascinated me. Turns out I’m not alone in that. It’s not something that just manifested into existence in the past decade, it has a long and winding history predating the new millennium.

However, that makes my normal “predictions” series of videos difficult to translate over here. Because, well, it was a thing. Not a thing of 2020, or 2010, or even 2000. It was just, a thing. A thing that happened.

That’s the video. Yup.
