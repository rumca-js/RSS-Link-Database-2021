Here at LTT, we’re often making videos about crazy small form factor, oversized, no compromise, or otherwise unusual and extreme PC builds. But… what about our employees? Are they all rocking RTX 3090s in their sweet battlestations, or are all of their systems at home just shells of glory, not to be used by even the most infrequent of gamers?
