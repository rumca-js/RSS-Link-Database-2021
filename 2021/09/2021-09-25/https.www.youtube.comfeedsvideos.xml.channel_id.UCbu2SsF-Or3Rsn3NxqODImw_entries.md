## Halo Games Ranked

With Halo Infinite set to release in December for the Xbox Series X, we’re looking back at the Halo series overall and ranking the mainline FSP franchise. From Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo Reach to Halo 5: Guardians, we’re pitting the classic Bungie and 343 Industries games against each other to see who comes out on top. The Master Chief and Cortana may dominate the charts, but how do the adventures of Noble 6 and Spartan Locke stack up to Spartan 117.

In this video, we are going to analyze each Halo game’s campaign, from the haunting explorations of Halo 3: ODST to the classic exploration of the alien Covenant’s culture in Halo 2. At the same time, we also take a look at the Halo games' most defining feature: multiplayer. From Warzone to Firefight to Invasion to Grif Ball, Halo has constantly set the bar for multiplayer, both in split-screen and on Xbox Live, and no discussion of the series can ignore the importance of Halo’s impact on online gaming. 

For this ranking, we’re not including the Halo Wars series or the offshoots like Spartan Strike or the arcade game Fireteam Raven, though they are great games for those who want more story context on Halo Infinite. And while Halo: The Master Chief Collection is absolutely the best way to play Halo in 2021, it’s also not featured on this list because it is ultimately a compilation package instead of one game. You can also sign up for Game Pass Ultimate to play every mainline Halo game as well as numerous spin-offs. 

And don’t forget to check out how Halo, the franchise that defined Xbox, almost wasn’t an Xbox game at all in this video! https://youtu.be/noE49iZ9Reg

Halo Infinite is right around the corner with it’s Microsoft confirmed December 8th, 2021 release date looming this holiday season. Halo Infinite is now available for pre-order. You can check out our pre-order guide on gamespot.com.
