We are starting a series on the Rings of Power! Beginning with the elves, we will uncover what exactly the powers were of the Three Elven Rings, what made them special compared to the rings of the dwarves and men, and how they were passed on from their creator, Celebrimbor, to Galadriel, Gil-galad (eventually Elrond), and Cirdan (eventually Gandalf).  Enjoy this video to learn all about Nenya, the ring of water, Vilya, the ring of air, and Narya, the ring of fire!
