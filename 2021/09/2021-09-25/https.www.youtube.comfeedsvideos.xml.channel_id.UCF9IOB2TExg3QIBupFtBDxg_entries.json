2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccine Can Induce Acute Myopericarditis in Mouse Model\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab707/6353927\nBackground\n\nPost-vaccination myocarditis and pericarditis reported after coronavirus mRNA vaccines. \n\nThe effect of accidental intravenous injection of this vaccine on the heart is unknown\n\nMethods in mice\n\nCompared difference between i.m. and i.v. injection of vaccine\n\nClinical manifestations\n\nHistopathological changes\n\nTissue mRNA expression\n\nSerum levels of cytokines and troponins\n\nWith normal saline (NS) control\n\nResults\n\nIntravenous SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine Administration Induced Grossly Visible Pathology in Heart\n\nOnly IV group developed histopathological changes of myopericarditis\n\nEvidenced by cardiomyocyte degeneration\n\nApoptosis\n\nNecrosis with adjacent inflammatory cell infiltration\n\nCalcific deposits on visceral pericardium\n\nBut\n\nEvidence of coronary artery or other cardiac pathologies was absent\n\nSpike antigen (immunostaining) occasionally found in infiltrating immune cells of the heart\n\nAnd in cardiomyocytes and intracardiac vascular endothelial cells\n\nThe histological changes of myopericarditis after the first IV-priming dose persisted for 2 weeks\n\nand were markedly aggravated by a second IM- or IV-booster dose\n\nNumerous inflammatory cytokines found in cardiac tissue\n\n(interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, interferon (IFN)-\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1)\n\nin the IV group but not the IM group\n\ncompatible with presence of myopericarditis in the IV group\n\nBallooning degeneration of hepatocytes was consistently found in the IV group.\n\nAll other organs appeared normal.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn vivo evidence that inadvertent intravenous injection of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines may induce myopericarditis. \n\nBrief withdrawal of syringe plunger to exclude blood aspiration may be one possible way to reduce such risk.\n\nBoth Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have clearly stated that their vaccines should only be given via IM route\n\nCurrent CDC and WHO guidelines no longer recommend precautionary measures during IM vaccine administration\n\nThe CDC Pink Book 2020 and WHO\n2015 position paper have recommended against aspiration prior to vaccine injection so as to minimize pain\n\nDeltoid to the vastus lateralis?\n\nOur study indicates that IV injection of vaccines might partially contribute to this clinical phenotype, \n\nthus warranting a reconsideration of the practice of IM injection without aspiration, \n\nwhich carries the risk of inadvertent IV injection.\n\nThrombocytopenia in mice reported in 2006\n\nBlood,
