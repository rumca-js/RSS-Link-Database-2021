From Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo Reach to Halo 5: Guardians, we\u2019re pitting the classic Bungie and 343 Industries games against each other to see who comes out on top. The Master Chief and Cortana may dominate the charts, but how do the adventures of Noble 6 and Spartan Locke stack up to Spartan 117.\n\nIn this video, we are going to analyze each Halo game\u2019s campaign, from the haunting explorations of Halo 3: ODST to the classic exploration of the alien Covenant\u2019s culture in Halo 2. At the same time, we also take a look at the Halo games' most defining feature: multiplayer. From Warzone to Firefight to Invasion to Grif Ball, Halo has constantly set the bar for multiplayer, both in split-screen and on Xbox Live, and no discussion of the series can ignore the importance of Halo\u2019s impact on online gaming.\u00a0\n\nFor this ranking, we\u2019re not including the Halo Wars series or the offshoots like Spartan Strike or the arcade game Fireteam Raven, though they are great games for those who want more story context on Halo Infinite. And while Halo: The Master Chief Collection is absolutely the best way to play Halo in 2021, it\u2019s also not featured on this list because it is ultimately a compilation package instead of one game. You can also sign up for Game Pass Ultimate to play every mainline Halo game as well as numerous spin-offs.\u00a0\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to check out how Halo, the franchise that defined Xbox, almost wasn\u2019t an Xbox game at all in this video! https://youtu.be/noE49iZ9Reg\n\nHalo Infinite is right around the corner with it\u2019s Microsoft confirmed December 8th, 2021 release date looming this holiday season. Halo Infinite is now available for pre-order.
