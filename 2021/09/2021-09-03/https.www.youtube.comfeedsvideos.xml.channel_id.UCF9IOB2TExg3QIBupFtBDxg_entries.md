Delta plus, First identified in India in 2020

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57564560

India and Europe classified a new VOV

AY.1, additional mutation K417N (Aldo found in Beta, SA stain)

India says, spreads more easily, binds more easily to lung cells, potentially resistant to monoclonal antibody therapy

No data to be over concerned now

USA, UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Japan, Poland, Nepal, Russia, China

Long covid and vaccination

Risk factors and disease profile of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app: a prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309921004606

Double vaccination

31% less likely to experience acute COVID symptoms

47% less likely to get Long COVID if they become infected

73% less likely to be hospitalised

Most common symptoms

Similar to unvaccinated adults

Anosmia, cough, fever, headaches, fatigue

All milder and less frequently

Half as likely to get multiple symptoms in the first week of illness

Sneezing, only symptom more common in vaccinated

Tim Spector

Vaccinations are massively reducing the chances of people getting Long COVID in two ways. 

Firstly, by reducing the risk of any symptoms by 8 to 10 fold 

and then by halving the chances of any infection turning into Long COVID, if it does happen.

We are encouraging people to get their 2nd jab as soon as they can

Sajid Javid

COVID-19 vaccines have saved more than 105,000 lives and prevented over 24 million infections in England alone

This research is encouraging, suggesting vaccines are not only preventing deaths but could also help prevent some of the longer lasting symptoms

80 long COVID assessment services have opened across England

It is clear vaccines are building a wall of defence against the virus and are the best way to protect people from serious illness

Australia

Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Time to leave lockdowns

Come out of the cave, live with the virus

Radical change from ‘fortress Australia’

‘Covid zero’

E.g. Melbourne, 200 days of lockdown over 2 years

Now

Vaccinating fact

All over 12years

Ease out of lockdowns

Vaccinated people, more freedoms

Continue testing and tracing

Retain low-level restrictions, mask-wearing, social distancing

Borders open at 80% threshold double dosage

?? December

Prof Ivo Mueller, Melbourne

The plan that is proposed is actually very thoughtful and careful

It's not 'Freedom Day, it's not let's throw everything out the window and go party

Predicted

13 – 1,500 deaths in 6 months

COVID bounce back, based on PCR and LFT test data
https://covid.joinzoe.com/data#levels-over-time

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-bounces-back-as-cases-start-to-rise

Based on PCR and LFT test data

7th to 21st August 2021

Around one million weekly contributors

25,876 recent swab tests

Symptomatic cases in fully vaccinated (UK), 29.4% of the total new daily cases

Our data shows post-vaccination infections are much more like a cold than the flu, with the top symptoms being runny nose, headache, sneezing, sore throat and loss of smell. 

We’re again calling on the government to add these cold-like symptoms to their list to help educate the public and catch more cases

New cases are highest in the 18-35 age groups

Followed by the 0-18 year olds

Prevalence

On average 1 in 100 people in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID

UK R value is 1.1 (Scotland, 1.2)

Long covid

Estimated that 870 cases a day will go on to experience symptoms for longer than 12 weeks

Probability of long COVID is much lower than the previous wave

Probability of contracting long COVID is much higher in younger people

Driven by the fact that more young people are contracting COVID now compared to older 
generations

Professor Tim Spector

Unfortunately, we’re back in a position where cases, hospitalisations and deaths are all going up and the UK has the highest rates of COVID in Europe, despite our superior vaccination rates. 

The main difference between the UK and Europe is our lack of restrictions. In many parts of Europe, people are still wearing face coverings and observing some social distancing. 

In the UK, where we eagerly declared ‘freedom’ from COVID and did away with even the most basic social measures, COVID has found an opportunity to spread. 

As kids head back to the classrooms, there’s a good chance cases will continue to rise from here.
