DokeV's latest trailer was unleashed during Gamescom and its exciting style, world, and similarities to Pokemon have gotten people excited. But, what exactly do you do in the game? Here's everything we know so far.

One of Gamescom’s biggest trailers this year was for an upcoming game titled DokeV. The trailer was fun, stylish, and flashy—and had Pokemon in a big city vibes. But ultimately, we still don’t know all that much about the game. So, what the heck is DokeV… and why am I so excited about a trailer that ultimately didn’t really show actual gameplay?

Check out new gameplay for Battlefield 2042's Specialist system, which is based on Battlefield's four Classes: Assault, Support, Engineer, and Recon. Each Specialist has one unique Specialty and Trait, but the rest of the loadout can be customized.

Webster Mackay comes from the Canadian military and is a part of the Assault class. He has a grappling hook that can help him get around to other areas quicker. Mackay also has the Nimble Trait, which allows him to move more quickly when aiming down sights.

Mary Falck served in the German army for six years and is a combat medic, based on Battlefield's Support class. Her S21 Syrette Pistol fires syringes that heal allies and damage enemies. Being a combat surgeon, she can nurse downed enemies back to full health when reviving.

Pyotr "Boris" Guskovsky is a Russian engineer and a weapons expert. He has a SG-36 Sentry that automatically spots and shoots at enemies within a certain radius. When his sentry gun locks onto a target, he also becomes aware of the enemy's position as well.

Lastly, Wikus "Casper" Van Daele is from South Africa and part of the Recon class. His OV-P Recon Drone can spot moving targets and disorient them with EMP blasts. He also has a Movement Sensor that alerts him to approaching enemies should they try to sneak up on him while he's on the ground or piloting his drone.
