On Sunday, Sept. 5, the Amateur Talent Contest finals take place at the Grandstand at the Minnesota State Fair. Nashville singer-songwriter Caitlyn Smith — who grew up in Cannon Falls, Minn., in Goodhue County — won the Minnesota State Fair's Amateur Talent Contest in 2001 as a 15-year-old. 

Smith has gone on to an excellent career in music, and last year, just after the release of her album "Supernova," Smith connected with The Current's Bill DeVille for a virtual session in which Smith performed tracks from that album. Watch three of these up-close-and-personal performances recorded right in Smith's home in 2020. On the final song, "Long Time Coming," Smith is accompanied on piano by her husband, musician Rollie Gaalswyk.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Feel That Way"
4:37 "Lonely Together"
8:29 "Long Time Coming"

PERSONNEL
Caitlyn Smith – vocals, guitar, piano
