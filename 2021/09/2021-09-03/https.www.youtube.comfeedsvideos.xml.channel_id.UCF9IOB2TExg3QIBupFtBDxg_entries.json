In many parts of Europe, people are still wearing face coverings and observing some social distancing. \n\nIn the UK, where we eagerly declared \u2018freedom\u2019 from COVID and did away with even the most basic social measures, COVID has found an opportunity to spread. \n\nAs kids head back to the classrooms, there\u2019s a good chance cases will continue to rise from here.\n\n\nUK data\n\nhttps://coronavirus.data.gov.uk\n\nUnited States data\n\nhttps://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases\n\nhttps://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends\n\nhttps://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_d7OLO_2nE", "date_published": "2021-09-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
