All of these new projects are said to be announced in 2022. \n\nPersia also goes over the only game to currently offer 8K on PS5, except there\u2019s a catch. While The Touryst renders internally at 8K resolution, the PS5 doesn't actually support that output over HDMI 2.1 and the developer Shin'en Multimedia is using an extreme supersampling technique to downsample every pixel on any connected 4K TV. \n\nLastly, Team Ninja's new Final Fantasy game, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, will launch in March 2022. A second demo is now available for PS5 and Xbox Series X and S. \n\nFor more information on all of these topics, please visit gamespot.com.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\nIntro - 00:00\nKonami working on new Metal Gear, Silent Hill, and Castlevania games? - 00:15\nThe PS5 finally has an 8K game, but there's a catch - 01:14\nStranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin demo out now - 02:27\nOutro - 03:14", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilRlsdW_jZ4", "date_published": "2021-10-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New World Ultimate Beginner\u2019s Guide", "description": "In this New World beginner\u2019s guide, we give tips for fast leveling, making the most of gear in and out of combat, as well as how to make the most of trade skills.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNew World is an MMORPG from Amazon Games set on the mythical island of Aeternum.

This substance grants power and eternal life but often at a cost and has led to the corruption of the island as well as the island\u2019s former masters to nearly go extinct.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, DeVante talks about all the important things a beginner should know about New World before they start playing. He breaks down ways to maximize XP gain in order to level up faster as well as how to cut down on travel time in games.

Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin does something similar with a take on the jobs system that's a big part of Final Fantasy's history. The ability to switch between combat roles on the fly allows for a whole lot of interesting versatility, adding tactical considerations to protagonist Jack's angry shouting, slashing, and headbutting.\n\nWe recently got a chance to go hands-on with the second playable demo of Stranger of Paradise ahead of its release. This new look at the game includes everything that was in the first demo, with some added story context. It also included another section that gives a sense of Final Fantasy Origins' take on the series and how expansive the job system really is, as well as how the gear systems and mission-based approach seem like they'll work on a large scale.\n\n#strangerofparadise #finalfantasyorigin", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM-rS3sFSqs", "date_published": "2021-10-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Elder Scrolls Online: Deadlands DLC Reveal Livestream", "description": "Tune to the ESO Gates of Oblivion Year-End stream at 1pm PT / 4pm ET and see the reveal of the latest DLC, Deadlands.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUKbP7pvx8s", "date_published": "2021-10-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Capcom Monster Hunter Spotlight | Tokyo Game Show 2021", "description": "Catch up on the latest details of the newly announced Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, as well as news and updates for Monster Hunter Rise and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, courtesy of the development team.\n\n#TGS2021 #tokyogameshow2021 #capcommonster", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmosJjrTK44", "date_published": "2021-09-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Diablo II Resurrected Review", "description": "Diablo II: Resurrected is a painfully faithful remaster of the original classic, which makes it difficult to get into over two decades later.\n\nAlessandro clicked thousands of enemies to death across 20 hours with Diablo II: Resurrected, trying out both a Paladin and Necromancer across the game's campaign and expansion.
