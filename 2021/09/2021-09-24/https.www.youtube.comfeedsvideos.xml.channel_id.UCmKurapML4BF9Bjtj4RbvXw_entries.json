They say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This album\u2019s journey of a thousand notes began with a single notion. \n\nWhat if \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d was a lullaby? We often hear from beautiful people such as yourself that much of our music can be used as a sleep aid. \u201cCounting sheep 2.0\u201d -- a symphonic prescription for insomnia. In fact, one of our favorite emails of all time was from a brave navy man who served on a submarine. In his letter he talked about his struggle with claustrophobia. Can you imagine? He said he couldn\u2019t get to sleep at night in his shoebox-sized space...until he found our music. Every night he\u2019d don his headphones, hit play and then close his eyes. He said our music would transport him to a place where there was plenty of room for peace of mind. He could finally fall asleep.\n\nStories like this made us want to compose a whole album full of musical melatonin. But not just any old lullabies -- with clich\u00e9 melodies and icky toy music box sounds. We wanted to go all out (as we like to do). We wanted to rewrite household \u201chits\u201d with a thoughtful lullaby filter to see if they could stand up to helping people like you lie down.\n\nThe result of such an endeavor starts with this tune you\u2019re watching now and will be fully released in October! The album is called \u201cLULLABY\u201d and it is dedicated to our friend, the courageous claustrophobic serviceman; to you parents who tirelessly, and often sleeplessly, love your children into becoming their best selves, praying for them as they sleep; AND to you insomniacs out there whose creative minds refuse to turn off at night. We know how that feels. \n\nWe hope you\u2019ll support us and buy (or stream) this album and make it part of your nightly routine -- a soundtrack to sleep by! Thank you from the bottom of our feather pillows for listening to our music, watching our videos and for supporting us. Without you all our dreams would still be asleep.\ud83d\ude34\n\nLove, The Piano Guys\n\nP.S. The BEST way to support this project is by putting your name on it!
