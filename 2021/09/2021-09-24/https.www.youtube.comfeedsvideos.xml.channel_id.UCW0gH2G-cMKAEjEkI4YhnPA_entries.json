Beginning with the elves, we will uncover what exactly the powers were of the Three Elven Rings, what made them special compared to the rings of the dwarves and men, and how they were passed on from their creator, Celebrimbor, to Galadriel, Gil-galad (eventually Elrond), and Cirdan (eventually Gandalf).  Enjoy this video to learn all about Nenya, the ring of water, Vilya, the ring of air, and Narya, the ring of fire!\n\nBe sure to visit Lord of Maps on Instagram for their exclusive giveaway, and use the code NERDOFMAPS at LordofMaps.com to save 15% on your order!\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
