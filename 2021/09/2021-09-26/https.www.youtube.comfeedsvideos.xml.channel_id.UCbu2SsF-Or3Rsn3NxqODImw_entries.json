Dread releases in October on Nintendo Switch.\n\nMetroid Dread doesn't waste any time in introducing what exactly there is to dread in the long-awaited sequel. Many of the game's trailers so far have featured the long-limbed, quadripedal robots known as EMMIs, who seem to be near impossible-to-kill sentries that series protagonist Samus Aran must simply avoid. EMMIs--or at least one version of them--are there right from the start of your adventure, and during my recent hands-on playthrough of the game's opening sector, EMMIs proved to be an effective, compelling way of instilling a healthy amount of panic to the series' tried-and-true core of action and exploration.\n\n#metroiddread #metroid", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9LZ2sSnHM", "date_published": "2021-09-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New World - Everything You Need To Know", "description": "New World is an MMORPG from Amazon Games releasing exclusively on PC on September 28, 2021.Shipwrecked on the island of Aeternum, it is up to the player to uncover secrets, harvest Azoth and keep control of the island from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nNew World is an MMORPG from Amazon Games set on the mythical island of Aeternum.

From the humble beginnings of 1942 to EA's upcoming Battlefield 2042, we break down the history of Battlefield and its legacy over the years.\n\nBattlefield has released several games over the last two decades as one of the most recognizable franchises in the video game industry. With Battlefield 2042 just around the corner, now is the perfect time to take a look at the History of Battlefield. In this video, we'll start from the beginning with Battlefield 1942, and how it set such a significant foundation for future Battlefield games to build off of.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield has an emphasis on land, air, and sea combat, creating a series that relishes chaotic and exciting gameplay, eventually expanding upon the core Conquest mode with other ways for players to engage each other. Every Battlefield game is notable in its own way, but Bad Company 2, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield 1 are standouts for various reasons, whether it's a greater emphasis on campaign modes, or taking the Battlefield destruction capabilities with the Frostbite engines to an all-time high.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 is slated to release on October 22, 2021, on Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PS4, PS5, and PC. The game will increase the size of Battlefield matches to a massive 128 players, with customizable load-outs and the incorporation of brand new Specialists in place of character classes. We\u2019ll have so much more to break down with Battlefield 2042 in the coming days, so stay tuned!\n\n#battlefield #battlefield2042", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVii2aNhWUo", "date_published": "2021-09-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Full Overwatch 2 Push Map Gameplay with Pro Players (with Commentary)", "description": "Watch a full Overwatch 2 Push match between some of the pro players in the Overwatch League.

From Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo Reach to Halo 5: Guardians, we\u2019re pitting the classic Bungie and 343 Industries games against each other to see who comes out on top. The Master Chief and Cortana may dominate the charts, but how do the adventures of Noble 6 and Spartan Locke stack up to Spartan 117.\n\nIn this video, we are going to analyze each Halo game\u2019s campaign, from the haunting explorations of Halo 3: ODST to the classic exploration of the alien Covenant\u2019s culture in Halo 2. At the same time, we also take a look at the Halo games' most defining feature: multiplayer. From Warzone to Firefight to Invasion to Grif Ball, Halo has constantly set the bar for multiplayer, both in split-screen and on Xbox Live, and no discussion of the series can ignore the importance of Halo\u2019s impact on online gaming.\u00a0\n\nFor this ranking, we\u2019re not including the Halo Wars series or the offshoots like Spartan Strike or the arcade game Fireteam Raven, though they are great games for those who want more story context on Halo Infinite. And while Halo: The Master Chief Collection is absolutely the best way to play Halo in 2021, it\u2019s also not featured on this list because it is ultimately a compilation package instead of one game. You can also sign up for Game Pass Ultimate to play every mainline Halo game as well as numerous spin-offs.\u00a0\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to check out how Halo, the franchise that defined Xbox, almost wasn\u2019t an Xbox game at all in this video! https://youtu.be/noE49iZ9Reg\n\nHalo Infinite is right around the corner with it\u2019s Microsoft confirmed December 8th, 2021 release date looming this holiday season.
