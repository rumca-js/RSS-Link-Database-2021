We went hands-on with the first sector of Metroid Dread and it's clear there will be a lot of tense moments with nearly indestructible EMMIs hunting you. Dread releases in October on Nintendo Switch.

Metroid Dread doesn't waste any time in introducing what exactly there is to dread in the long-awaited sequel. Many of the game's trailers so far have featured the long-limbed, quadripedal robots known as EMMIs, who seem to be near impossible-to-kill sentries that series protagonist Samus Aran must simply avoid. EMMIs--or at least one version of them--are there right from the start of your adventure, and during my recent hands-on playthrough of the game's opening sector, EMMIs proved to be an effective, compelling way of instilling a healthy amount of panic to the series' tried-and-true core of action and exploration.

Battlefield is one of the most iconic FPS games of the past few decades. From the humble beginnings of 1942 to EA's upcoming Battlefield 2042, we break down the history of Battlefield and its legacy over the years.

Battlefield has released several games over the last two decades as one of the most recognizable franchises in the video game industry. With Battlefield 2042 just around the corner, now is the perfect time to take a look at the History of Battlefield. In this video, we'll start from the beginning with Battlefield 1942, and how it set such a significant foundation for future Battlefield games to build off of. 

Battlefield has an emphasis on land, air, and sea combat, creating a series that relishes chaotic and exciting gameplay, eventually expanding upon the core Conquest mode with other ways for players to engage each other. Every Battlefield game is notable in its own way, but Bad Company 2, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield 1 are standouts for various reasons, whether it's a greater emphasis on campaign modes, or taking the Battlefield destruction capabilities with the Frostbite engines to an all-time high. 

Battlefield 2042 is slated to release on October 22, 2021, on Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PS4, PS5, and PC. The game will increase the size of Battlefield matches to a massive 128 players, with customizable load-outs and the incorporation of brand new Specialists in place of character classes. We’ll have so much more to break down with Battlefield 2042 in the coming days, so stay tuned!

## Halo Games Ranked

With Halo Infinite set to release in December for the Xbox Series X, we’re looking back at the Halo series overall and ranking the mainline FSP franchise. From Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo Reach to Halo 5: Guardians, we’re pitting the classic Bungie and 343 Industries games against each other to see who comes out on top. The Master Chief and Cortana may dominate the charts, but how do the adventures of Noble 6 and Spartan Locke stack up to Spartan 117.

In this video, we are going to analyze each Halo game’s campaign, from the haunting explorations of Halo 3: ODST to the classic exploration of the alien Covenant’s culture in Halo 2. At the same time, we also take a look at the Halo games' most defining feature: multiplayer. From Warzone to Firefight to Invasion to Grif Ball, Halo has constantly set the bar for multiplayer, both in split-screen and on Xbox Live, and no discussion of the series can ignore the importance of Halo’s impact on online gaming. 

For this ranking, we’re not including the Halo Wars series or the offshoots like Spartan Strike or the arcade game Fireteam Raven, though they are great games for those who want more story context on Halo Infinite. And while Halo: The Master Chief Collection is absolutely the best way to play Halo in 2021, it’s also not featured on this list because it is ultimately a compilation package instead of one game. You can also sign up for Game Pass Ultimate to play every mainline Halo game as well as numerous spin-offs. 

And don’t forget to check out how Halo, the franchise that defined Xbox, almost wasn’t an Xbox game at all in this video! https://youtu.be/noE49iZ9Reg

Halo Infinite is right around the corner with it’s Microsoft confirmed December 8th, 2021 release date looming this holiday season. Halo Infinite is now available for pre-order. You can check out our pre-order guide on gamespot.com.
