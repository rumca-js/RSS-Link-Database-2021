## Detecting Earthquakes: AI vs. Citizen Scientists

There are over 13,000 active seismic stations out there, producing far more data than seismologists have time to go through. So, researchers set up a showdown of humans versus machines to sift through all this information and, in the process, crown the heavyweight earthquake detection champion.

The project we described in this video has ended, but many scientists recruit for citizen science projects over at https://www.zooniverse.org/.

There’s also the Did You Feel It project, where anyone who feels a rumble can fill out a quick survey and report it to the US Geological Survey: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/dyfi/.
