The Phalanx class is free to all Aliens: Fireteam Elite players starting on September 8th, 2021. \n\nThe Phalanx's primary ability is a shield you can toggle on and off--there's no cooldown on this thing. When you pull the shield out, it allows you to absorb attacks without getting hurt, so long as they're coming from in front of you.\n\nThe Phalanx's second ability by default is the Shock Pulse. It stuns enemies in a radius around you, making it great for those moments when you're unexpectedly surrounded and your shield isn't helping.\n\nThe Phalanx's passive ability, Bulwark, increases the damage your weapons do for every attack you block with your shield, so there's a big incentive to try to keep it deployed as much as possible.\n\n#aliens", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy2HRgCI9uw", "date_published": "2021-09-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Vanguard - Hands On With the Beta", "description": "GameSpot was able to playtest the Call of Duty: Vanguard Beta and check out what's changed and what\u2019s been added. This includes more weapons, maps, game modes, and customization. Join Richie as he breaks down his experience with the hands-on gameplay session. Call of Duty: Vanguard's Beta will be open to PlayStation players Sep 10th-13th, and will open to all other platforms September 18th-20th. \n\nCall of Duty: Vanguard will soon be launching their public Beta. (Sep 10th for PlayStation and Sep 18 for all platforms) GameSpot was able to play the beta before launch and Richie Bracamonte is here to break it all down. Several updates were made including more game modes, perks, killstreaks and more. Developer Sledgehammer Games also addressed issues plaguing the Alpha including lighting and wounded player effects where the screen would darken on the brink of death.\n\nAside from these fixes, the beta build included four new maps of all sizes. A large, snowy city map (Red Star), A lush beach map (Gavutu), a hotel map (Hotel Royal) and an indoor mountain-top map (Eagles Nest). All of which have been confirmed for the public beta. 20 total maps have been confirmed for the full release, four of which are 2v2 gunfight exclusives. Other features have been added to the beta such as the returning field upgrades and create-a-class system. Despite using weapons from the second World War, there are many ways to upgrade your loadout with a gunsmith that follows closely in line to the style of 2019\u2019s Modern Warfare.\n\nCall of Duty: Vanguard releases November 5th and has two more public betas scheduled later this month. Stay tuned to GameSpot for more coverage of Vanguard as well as the upcoming Battlefield 2042 and Halo Infinite.\n\n#cod #codvanguard", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEc-a1bbHH4", "date_published": "2021-09-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Marvel's Midnight Suns Gameplay Showcase Full Presentation", "description": "Watch as The Hunter and Wolverine are teaming up against Sabretooth in our this gameplay clip of Marvel's Midnight Suns.\n\nWolverine's abilities include razor-sharp claws, regenerating health, and his ability to taunt enemies into focusing on him making him well-suited to fighting on the front line.
