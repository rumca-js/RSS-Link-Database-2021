It had been just hours since Al Qaeda operatives killed nearly 3,000 people in the worst terror attack on the U.S. in the country\u2019s history, turning four passenger airplanes into deadly weapons.\n\nStanding before the building that\u2019s believed to have been the intended target of one of the hijacked planes, Republicans and Democrats alike raised their voices to sing \u201cGod Bless America\u201d in a stirring moment of unity. It wouldn\u2019t last.\n\n\u201cAmerica After 9/11,\u201d a special, two-hour FRONTLINE documentary from acclaimed filmmaker Michael Kirk and his team, reveals why, finding in the U.S. response to 9/11 a chain of unintended consequences that would usher in an era of fear, mistrust and division.\n\nDrawing on both new interviews and those from the dozens of documentaries Kirk and his team have made in the years since 9/11, the documentary offers an epic re-examination of the decisions that changed the world and transformed America. \n\nWatch \"America After 9/11\" in full starting Sept. 7, 2021: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/america-after-9-11/\n\nFind FRONTLINE on the PBS Video App, where there are more than 300 FRONTLINE documentaries available for you to watch anytime: https://to.pbs.org/FLVideoApp \n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline \n\nMajor funding for FRONTLINE is provided by the Ford Foundation.
