https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/09/07/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/

Activated “crisis standards of care” 10 hospitals

Get treated in hallways etc

Delayed operations

More Idahoans need to choose to receive the vaccine so we can minimize the spread of the disease and reduce the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations,

many of which involve younger Idahoans and are preventable with safe and effective vaccines
