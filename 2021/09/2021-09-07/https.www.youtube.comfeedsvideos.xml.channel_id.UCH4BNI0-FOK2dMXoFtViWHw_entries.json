But you\u2019re not TOTALLY alive. Bits of you are always breaking down, being thrown out, and being replaced. Even right now, parts of you are dying. Some of your cells even died before you were born. And some will never come back. These are all very strange, mildly uncomfortable things to think about. And what\u2019s even stranger than that is a big fraction of your body is, was, and will never be alive. So how much of you is dead? \n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/how-much-of-you-is-alive/home \n\nSUBSCRIBE so you don\u2019t miss a video! \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/iotbs_sub\n\n-----------\n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\n\nClinger-Hamilton Family\nKen Board\nAttila Pix\nBurt Humburg\nDeliciousKashmiri\nBrian Chang\nRoy Lasris\nJavier Soto\ndani bowman\nDavid Johnston\nSalih Arslan\nBaerbel Winkler\nRobert Young\nAmy Sowada\nEric Meer\nDustin\nMarcus Tuepker\nKaren Haskell\nAlecZero\n\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EowCxpKKJ0", "date_published": "2021-09-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
