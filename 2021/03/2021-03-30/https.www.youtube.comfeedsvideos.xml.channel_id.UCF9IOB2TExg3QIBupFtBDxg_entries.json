appraisal.\n\nhttps://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus\n\nThe mission\n\nJoint international team, 17 Chinese and 17 international experts\n\n14 January to 10 February 2021 in Wuhan\n\nPrevent reinfection, animals and humans\n\nPrevent establishment of new zoonotic reservoirs, mink, cats\n\nTimeline\n\nOutbreak may have started sometime in the months before the middle of December 2019\n\n(Based on molecular sequence data)\n\nCirculation of SARS-CoV-2 preceded the initial detection of cases by several weeks.\n\nVirus transmission widespread in Wuhan by the first week of 2020\n\nEpidemic in Wuhan preceded the spread in the rest of Hubei Province\n\n174 COVID-19 cases with onset of symptoms in December 2019\n\n8th December 2019, first official case\n\n76,000 \u2018cases\u2019 from October and November unlikely\n\n Genomics\n\nHuanan market, at the point of its closing, 923 environmental samples, 73 samples were positive\n\nWidespread contamination of surfaces with SARS-CoV-2\n\nHuanan market cluster had identical virus genomes\n\nOther genomes were also discovered from December / January\n\nUpstream suppliers to the Huanan market taken during 2020, no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in animals\n\nInitial cases associated with Huanan market, other markets and no markets\n\nCoronaviruses most highly related to SARS-CoV-2 found in bats and pangolins\n\nNone sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 to serve as its direct progenitor\n\nSampling before and after the outbreak\n\n80 000 wildlife, livestock and poultry samples collected, 31 provinces in China\n\nNo positive result for SARS-CoV-2 antibody or nucleic acid\n\nCold chains\n\nCold chain products, not tested at the time\n\nConfirmed international transmission in cold chains\n\nFour conclusions\n\nQualitative risk assessment\n\nDirect zoonotic spillover is considered to be a possible-to-likely pathway\n\nIntroduction through an intermediate host is considered to be a likely to very likely pathway\n\nIntroduction through cold/ food chain products is considered a possible pathway\n\nIntroduction through a laboratory incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway \n\nNext phase\n\nWidespread testing of domestic and wild animals \n\nRhinolophus bats, southern provinces of China, countries around East Asia, South-East Asia and any other regions\n\nMore cold chain analysis\n\nPositive results in sewage, serum, human or animal tissues/swab and other SARS-CoV-2 test by the end of 2019\n\nConvene a global expert group\n\nhttps://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-remarks-at-the-member-state-briefing-on-the-report-of-the-international-team-studying-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/30/who-criticises-chinas-data-sharing-as-it-releases-covid-origins-report\n\nUS, UK, Australia, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Republic of Korea, Slovenia, Statement\n\nIt is equally essential that we voice our shared concerns\n\nthat the international expert study on the source of the Sars-Cov-2 virus was significantly delayed\n\nand lacked access to complete, original data and samples\n\nWhile regretting the late start of the study, the delayed deployment of the experts and the limited availability of early samples and related data, \n\nwe consider the work carried out to date and the report released today as a helpful first step\n\nEU statement also called on all relevant authorities to help with the next stages\n\nSo that any gaps in data needed to further the investigation can be addressed\n\nCalled for timely access for independent experts early in future pandemics\n\nAccess to China after months of fraught negotiations\n\nWhite House \nNo space for this section in YT comments, descriptions are of limited length.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\n\nIn my discussions with the team, they expressed the difficulties they encountered in accessing raw data\n\nI expect future collaborative studies to include more timely and comprehensive data sharing\n\nScientists would benefit from full access to data including biological samples from at least September 2019\n\nI concur with the team\u2019s conclusion that farmers, suppliers and their contacts will need to be interviewed\n\nTeam also visited several laboratories in Wuhan and considered the possibility that the virus entered the human population as a result of a laboratory incident.\n\nHowever, I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough. \n\nFurther data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions.\n\nLet me say clearly that as far as WHO is concerned all hypotheses remain on the table.\n\nAlthough the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy\n\nThis report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end.", "link":
