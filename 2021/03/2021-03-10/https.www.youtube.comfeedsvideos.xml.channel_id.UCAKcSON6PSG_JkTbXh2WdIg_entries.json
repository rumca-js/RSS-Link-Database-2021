They had recently released the album, \"Always Tomorrow,\" which frontperson Bethany Cosentino explained is a hopeful title. \"I think the overall theme of the album is very much the idea that at times we can be our own worst enemies, and learning to get out of our way and let life happen,\" she says.\n\nDid life ever happen just days after that. But one year on, we look ahead to a brighter future as we share this fantastic three-song set from Best Coast, recorded live in our studio on March 9, 2020.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Different Light\"\n3:17 \"For The First Time\" \n6:52 \"Everything Has Changed\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nBethany Cosentino \u2013 vocals, guitar, keys\nBobb Bruno \u2013 lead guitar\nBrett Mielke \u2013 bass\nDylan Fujioka \u2013 drums \nJoseph Bautista \u2013 second guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Peter Ecklund\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Jesse Wiza\n\nFIND MORE:\n2012 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/07/27/best-coast-live\n2015 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/06/08/best-coast-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2015 Guitar Collection interview with Bobb Bruno:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/06/10/the-current-s-guitar-collection-best-coast-s-bobb-bruno-eastman-t386\n2020 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/03/09/best-coast-play-songs-from-always-tomorrow-live-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#bestcoast #bestcoastband", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_rrUI2x00Y", "date_published": "2021-03-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Listen to Looch: the untold story of Parliament Funkadelic", "description": "Mary Lucia talks about \"Tear the Roof Off: the untold story of Parliament Funkadelic.\" You know when you're watching a doc and it's got \"untold\" or \"the real story,\" it's going to be told probably by people that weren't the main players. But this documentary is amazing because Parliament were the kind of band the likes of which there may never be another.\n\nA number of members of Parliament Funkadelic are interviewed, including Billy Bass Nelson, who coined the name Funkadelic. George Clinton was undisputedly a genius, but the way he may have treated his bandmates does get called into question.\n\n\"Tear the Roof Off: the untold story of Parliament Funkadelic\" is streaming now on Amazon Prime, YouTube and other platforms.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#parliamentfunkadelic #marylucia #listentolooch", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y6lI6XxWcE", "date_published": "2021-03-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
