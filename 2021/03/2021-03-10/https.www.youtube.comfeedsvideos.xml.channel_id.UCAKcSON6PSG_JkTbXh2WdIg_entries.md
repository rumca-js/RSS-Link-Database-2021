Four years ago, Thundercat (aka Stephen Bruner) visited The Current not long after winning a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration on Kendrick Lamar's "To Pimp a Butterfly."

Recalling the moment immediately following his Grammy win, Thundercat said, "It was trippy because I texted [Kendrick Lamar] after, and I was like, 'Yo dude, we won one,' and he was like, 'Tight.'"

During their March 2017 visit to The Current, Thundercat and his bandmates — drummer Justin Brown and pianist Dennis Hamm — stopped in to chat with host Mac Wilson and to perform songs off their latest album, "Drunk" and from 2013's "Apocalypse," live in studio. Watch two songs from that performance.

SONGS PERFORMED

One year ago today, on March 9, 2020, Best Coast visited The Current studio just as the spread of the coronavirus pandemic was gathering pace in the United States. They had recently released the album, "Always Tomorrow," which frontperson Bethany Cosentino explained is a hopeful title. "I think the overall theme of the album is very much the idea that at times we can be our own worst enemies, and learning to get out of our way and let life happen," she says.

Did life ever happen just days after that. But one year on, we look ahead to a brighter future as we share this fantastic three-song set from Best Coast, recorded live in our studio on March 9, 2020.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Different Light"
3:17 "For The First Time" 
6:52 "Everything Has Changed"

PERSONNEL
Bethany Cosentino – vocals, guitar, keys
Bobb Bruno – lead guitar
Brett Mielke – bass
Dylan Fujioka – drums 
Joseph Bautista – second guitar

## Listen to Looch: the untold story of Parliament Funkadelic
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y6lI6XxWcE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y6lI6XxWcE)

Mary Lucia talks about "Tear the Roof Off: the untold story of Parliament Funkadelic." You know when you're watching a doc and it's got "untold" or "the real story," it's going to be told probably by people that weren't the main players. But this documentary is amazing because Parliament were the kind of band the likes of which there may never be another.

A number of members of Parliament Funkadelic are interviewed, including Billy Bass Nelson, who coined the name Funkadelic. George Clinton was undisputedly a genius, but the way he may have treated his bandmates does get called into question.

"Tear the Roof Off: the untold story of Parliament Funkadelic" is streaming now on Amazon Prime, YouTube and other platforms.
