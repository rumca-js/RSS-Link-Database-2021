LYRICS

Don't you fall into despair 
I got your back this time 
Tell me when you're coming home 
 
Don't you see how much I care 
Just let the stars align 
No i can't face the storm alone 
 
Hold on 
Never let go 
We're higher than we ever been 
Can't you 
Feel how we grow 
 
So won't you tell me
When will I see you
When will I see you again
 
Now that I'm ready 
When will I see you  
When will I see you again 
 
Don't you leave without a trace
I got my eyes on you 
You've been off for way too long 
 
You will leave an empty space 
Into the sky of blue 
Just to help yourself along 
 
Hold on 
Never let go 
We're higher than we ever been 
Can't you 
Feel how we grow 
 
So won't you tell me
When will I see you
When will I see you again
Now that I'm ready 
When will I see you
When will I see you again  
 
For so long I've been  
Waiting for your love 
Keep longing for the time 
For so long I’ve been 
Aching for your love 
Keep longing for the time 
 
So won't you tell me 
When will I see you 
When will I see you again 
Now that I’m ready 
When will I see you
When will I see you again
