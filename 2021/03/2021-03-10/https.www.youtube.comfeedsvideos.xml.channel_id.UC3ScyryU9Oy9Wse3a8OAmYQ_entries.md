Filmed over three years by producers Dan Edge and Lauren Mucciolo, with unprecedented access to the solitary unit at Maine State Prison, “Last Days of Solitary” portrays the psychological toll and the challenges the prison faces handling men considered the most dangerous and difficult in the state. It’s a haunting portrait of life in solitary, and a unique document of a risky reform experiment.
