I explain how I get tack-sharp product shots for the PCBs and products I review from time to time. I don't always focus-stack, because I don't always need a super sharp image... but I do it often enough I figured I'd make a video to show how it's done.

You can do it with any camera that allows manual focus (or heck, you might be able to figure out how to do it using a smartphone too!), and it's a great way to take your small product pictures from 'nice' to 'great', especially if you are taking pictures of a small item you want to sell or advertise!

I used a Nikon D750 and 60mm macro lens for this video, but you don't need a macro lens; like all things photography, a macro lens just makes it easier to get a good quality image on the first attempt!
