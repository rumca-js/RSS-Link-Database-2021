It\u2019s one that we\u2019ve wanted to do for a \u201clong time!\" Since we\u2019re worried the new style will throw you off, we won\u2019t make it an official video release yet (i.e. filmed at Boston Fenway Baseball Stadium or somewhere cool). This A.I. video (Yes, those are artificial intelligence generated hands from our brand new A.I. Technology. It transfers midi info from my key strokes and voila!) is sort of a trial balloon to see what you think. Here\u2019s hoping people will feel \u201cmore than a feeling!\"\n\nProduced by Chuck E.
