Unfortunately, sacrifices in performance had to be made for it to work on the Switch, and we do a side by side comparison to see the details.\n\nWe take a look at the in-game menus, weapons, abilities, and combat and compare it to PC gameplay. Issues such as stuttering, pop-in's, frame drops, and low resolution textures appear on the Switch version, making it not ideal for the serious competitor. But now, Apex Legends has arrived on every major console, and is playable on all platforms.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJVPrXFGsVs", "date_published": "2021-03-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Bethesda Joins the Xbox Family", "description": "Bethesda has officially joined Xbox and in honor of the new venture 20 Bethesda Games have now been added to Xbox Game Pass! #Bethesda #Xbox #XboxGamePass", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVr12Cjm9JI", "date_published": "2021-03-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "12 Biggest Plot Twists In Games", "description": "Some of the best moments in games are the plot twists that hit you when you least expect it.

Today we are talking about two of the most popular USB microphones on the market right now, that is the Hyper X Quadcast and the Blue Yeti, both extremely popular choices for gamers and Twitch streamers alike.\n\nBoth the HyperX Quadcast and the Blue Yeti have been out for a while now, but they are constantly compared to each other and are still real competitors when it comes to being some of the best USB mics in their price range.\u00a0\n\nThe Quadcast comes in HyperX's trademark black and red colours, with the microphone being illuminated whenever the user is audible. If you want to go a level higher to the Quadcast S you get the bonus of RGB customization, but the base model is fixed in crimson.\u00a0 The regular Quadcast does come with some features that make it a great mic for streaming and content creation straight out of the box, such as its integrated pop filter and tap-to-mute functionality.\u00a0\n\nUp against it is the Blue Yeti. It's a larger and heavier device than the Quadcast but still comes with the same four audio profiles. It does, however, have better audio monitoring functionality with its adjustable passthrough to allow the user to monitor their audio levels during livestreams or recording sessions.\u00a0\n\nWhile these USB microphones are very similar, in the video above we go through the differences that separate them and name our mic pick for gamers and content creators.\u00a0\n\nAudio and voiceover were recorded with each microphone during the relevant sections, and treated with identical post-production settings to ensure a fair comparison.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVfcLEERG3o", "date_published": "2021-03-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder\u2019s Revenge Trailer - Official Gameplay Announcement", "description": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder\u2019s Revenge reunites Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello to kick shell in a beautifully realized pixel art world invoking the turtles\u2019 classic 1987 design.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijKD0HIpgJM", "date_published": "2021-03-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Best Super Mario Trailers (1985-2021)", "description": "In celebration of Super Mario's 35th anniversary this year, we take a look at the best trailers and commercials from the Super Mario games.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUO3Dm_3zOU", "date_published": "2021-03-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
