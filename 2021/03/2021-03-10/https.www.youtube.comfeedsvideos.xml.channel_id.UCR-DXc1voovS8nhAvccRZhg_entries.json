I don't always focus-stack, because I don't always need a super sharp image... but I do it often enough I figured I'd make a video to show how it's done.\n\nYou can do it with any camera that allows manual focus (or heck, you might be able to figure out how to do it using a smartphone too!), and it's a great way to take your small product pictures from 'nice' to 'great', especially if you are taking pictures of a small item you want to sell or advertise!\n\nI used a Nikon D750 and 60mm macro lens for this video, but you don't need a macro lens; like all things photography, a macro lens just makes it easier to get a good quality image on the first attempt!\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\n\nGear I used to do focus stacking (affiliate links):\n\n  - Nikon D750: https://amzn.to/3bs2AuE\n  - Nikon 60mm f/2.8D: https://amzn.to/3qBZOYh\n  - Joby Gorillapod 5K for DSLR: https://amzn.to/2OEb5Kk\n  - White posterboard: (Get it for less than a buck at a craft store!)\n  - Adobe Photoshop: (Part of Adobe's annoying subscription service, Creative Cloud)\n\nRead the how-to on my blog, too: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/how-focus-stack-set-images-photoshop\n\n#focusstacking #photography #nikon\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - Taking pictures\n02:42 - Preparing the images\n04:29 - Stacking in Photoshop\n06:00 - The final result!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYVZxBF2Q", "date_published": "2021-03-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
