Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAbby O'Neill | March 11, 2021\nBlack Coffee, a figurehead of the global South African dance movement, is known for his undeniable DJ sets and AfroHouse anthems that (under normal circumstances) light up dancefloors around the world. He brings that same feeling to his Tiny Desk (home) concert, but with a unique configuration: live instrumentation. \n\nBorn in Durban and raised in the Eastern Cape in Mthatha, Black Coffee\u2019s subculture of soulful house transports me to an elevated state. If you ask me, this is the pure embodiment of feel-good music. That shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, because house music has always been about love. It\u2019s a form of sonic escapism that provides a sanctuary for all beings, regardless of race, age, or gender. Therefore, it\u2019s only fitting that Black Coffee rocks a tee embossed with \u201cI Heart You\u201d across his chest. \n\nShot in the auditorium at the National School of Arts in Johannesburg, Black Coffee tapped students to assist with production as part of their internship. Kicking off the set is \u201cYou Rock My World\u201d featuring Soulstar, a classic dance joint from his Africa Rising album whose convergence of pulsating percussion, a calming melody, and the sultry vibes of Soulstar\u2019s voice feels like a spiritual palette cleanser. He follows that up with \"Flava\" and \"Wish You Were Here,\u201d two tracks from his new LP, Subconsciously, whose litany of special guests -- including Diplo and Pharrell -- is a coronation of Black Coffee\u2019s meteoric rise.\n\nSET LIST\n\"You Rock My World\" (feat.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | March 10, 2021\nOver the years, African musicians have elevated expectations at the Tiny Desk. The distinctive vibrations left by artists like Burna Boy, KOKOKO! and the Soweto Gospel Choir have lead to some of the most unforgettable moments in our rich history. This (home) concert feels like the culmination of all of those moments.\n\nTo celebrate the new compilation Rhythms of Zamunda: Music Inspired By Coming 2 America, six artists representing four countries in Africa perform a megamix of selections from the project. Each performance from the pan-African project bridges the distance between the countries and cultures, and gets more exhilarating by the minute.\n\nSouth Africa's Nasty C \u2014 who's arguably the biggest rapper on the continent \u2014 opens the set and trades verses with Tiny Desk alumni Ari Lennox on \"Black and White.\" He then sends us over to Cameroon for some Afrobeats flavor, courtesy of Locko and his stripped-down version of \"Magnet.\" We then circle back around to South Africa to hear from R&B newcomer Ricky Tyler. From there, we head north to Nigeria to do the \"Jiggy Bop\" with Alpha P before we take one last trip to South Africa for award-winning dance DJ and producer Prince Kaybee's \"Fetch Your Life,\" featuring Msaki. Finally, Togo duo Toofan dares us not to dance to \"Y\u00e9 Mama.\"\n\nIn addition to the sweeping range of the showings, the look of each set is stunning: vibrant, opulent colors; meticulous Tiny Desk shelf recreations; gorgeous African artifacts; and a few nuggets dedicated to King Akeem of Coming 2 America. This cultural clash is the biggest amplification of African voices we've ever had the pleasure of presenting.\n\nSET LIST\nNasty C (feat.
