EMA recommends COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen for authorisation in the EU

https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-recommends-covid-19-vaccine-janssen-authorisation-eu

Janssen should start delivering vaccines by April, and significant amounts by May

https://nos.nl/artikel/2372206-vierde-coronavaccin-goedgekeurd-voor-eu-janssen-krijgt-positief-oordeel.html

Recommended conditional marketing authorisation, 18 years +

Concluded by consensus that the data on the vaccine were robust and met the criteria for efficacy, safety and quality

4th vaccine now for EU, first single dose

Phase 3

N = over 44,000

RCT

Half and half

67% reduction in the number of symptomatic cases after 2 weeks

US efficacy data

72% effective in preventing moderate illness

85% effective at protecting against severe cases 

100% effective in preventing hospitalization and death after one month

Side effects

Usually mild or moderate

Cleared within a couple of days

Pain at the injection site, headache, tiredness, muscle pain and nausea

Pharmacovigilance will continue

UK

Ordered 30 million J and J

Denmark 

14 day halt in use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine

Blood clots, and one death

Health Minister Magnus Heunicke

precautionary measure

we must respond in a timely and careful manner

Austria

One woman (49) died 10 days after vaccination

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg have also stopped using the batch

EMA

Probably 3 cases and one death

One million doses in batch

Safety committee was reviewing the Austrian case

there is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine

thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than that seen in the general population

22 cases of thromboembolic events, three million people vaccinated with AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Economic Area

Authorised 29th January

Epidemiology of venous thromboembolism

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624298/

Incidence rate

Men, 130 per 100,000 per year

Women, 110 per 100,000 per year

That’s 10 per month per 100,000

That’s 120 per million per month

Therefore for 3 million of the population 360 thromboembolic events expected per month

Czech Republic

Sent first patients to Poland

Hungary

Cases higher than in December

Poland

Cases highest since late November

increased looseness among Poles towards anti-Covid measures

Brazil

Population 214 million

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-56355861

Cases, 79,876

Deaths, + 2,000 = 270,656

Second highest death numbers

Margareth Dalcolmo, doctor and researcher at Fiocruz

the worst moment of the pandemic in Brazil

overload and even collapse of health systems

Dr Pedro Hallal, Epidemiologist

If we do not start vaccinating the population here very soon, it will become a massive tragedy

It took a long time for the politicians to act

P.1

Could be up to twice as transmittable as the original virus

Chance of reinfection, 25% to 60%

Brazil, natural laboratory, when coronavirus goes relatively unchecked

Breeding ground for new variants, several VOCs circulating

Rapid vaccination and NPIs required

Vaccines remains efficacious, but probably slight reductions

Alaska, immunization available to anyone 16 and older who lives or works in the state

US, past 7 days, 2.15 million doses per day

Fists dose, 61 million

Second dose, 32 million

Cases and deaths, CDC data

Possible UK surge

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-56334902

Prof Chris Whitty

Unlocking too quickly, substantial surge while a lot of people are not protected

A lot of people may think this is all over. 

It is very easy to forget how quickly things can turn bad

Three weeks to build up immunity

So only the first four priority groups - the over-70s, health and care staff and the extremely clinical vulnerable

Nearly half of hospital admissions have been seen in the under-70s

Most transmission driven by younger people

Therefore, UK strategy will not impact spread for a while yet

UK, now

Cases, +5,766 (+ 40,600)
Down 24.5%

Deaths, + 231(+1,329)
Down 33.2%

Admitted, + 590 (+5,154)
Down 29.8%

Hospitalised, 9,418 (first time below 10,000 since 25th October)

Vaccinated

First dose, 22,592,528

Second dose, 1,181,431

UK is not using a one dose strategy

How do the Pfizer and Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines compare? And how do they affect different people?

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/vaccines-webinar-immune-variation

March 8, 2021

N = 700,000

Injections, daily health reports

Pfizer vaccine first now, Oxford AstraZeneca as well

Both vaccines cause the body cells to produce the required antigen

Both vaccines induce really high levels of antibodies and T cells

Consistent with phase 3 data

Tim Spector

We see around a 70% reduction in mild disease after the vaccine, which is what we would expect. It’s really good news

Systemic side effects

Tiredness, headache, chills

First dose, Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, 30%

Pfizer vaccine, 10%

Pfizer systemic effects worse if people have had CoViD infection

Pfizer side effects worse after second dose

After effects seem less than phase 3 data

Can’t associate measured immune responses with protection, eg. antibodies may be low, but protection good

Females, younger people, people who had a previous COVID infection, more likely to report after-effects from either vaccine

Not related to level of immunity generated

The FDA has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical support and been hospitalized after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for horses.

Ivermectin is not an anti-viral (a drug for treating viruses).

Ivermectin: a systematic review from antiviral effects to COVID-19 complementary regimen

Ivermectin proposes many potentials effects to treat a range of diseases

antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-cancer properties

It is highly effective against many microorganisms including some viruses

In this comprehensive systematic review, antiviral effects of ivermectin are summarized including in vitro and in vivo studies over the past 50 years

Several studies reported antiviral effects of ivermectin on RNA viruses such as Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Hendra, Newcastle, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, chikungunya, Semliki Forest, Sindbis, Avian influenza A, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, Human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

Furthermore, there are some studies showing antiviral effects of ivermectin against DNA viruses such as Equine herpes type 1, BK polyomavirus, pseudorabies, porcine circovirus 2, and bovine herpesvirus 1

In vivo studies of animal models revealed a broad range of antiviral effects of ivermectin
