Want to get great audio in your streams, multiplayer games and content creation? Today we are talking about two of the most popular USB microphones on the market right now, that is the Hyper X Quadcast and the Blue Yeti, both extremely popular choices for gamers and Twitch streamers alike.

Both the HyperX Quadcast and the Blue Yeti have been out for a while now, but they are constantly compared to each other and are still real competitors when it comes to being some of the best USB mics in their price range. 

The Quadcast comes in HyperX's trademark black and red colours, with the microphone being illuminated whenever the user is audible. If you want to go a level higher to the Quadcast S you get the bonus of RGB customization, but the base model is fixed in crimson.  The regular Quadcast does come with some features that make it a great mic for streaming and content creation straight out of the box, such as its integrated pop filter and tap-to-mute functionality. 

Up against it is the Blue Yeti. It's a larger and heavier device than the Quadcast but still comes with the same four audio profiles. It does, however, have better audio monitoring functionality with its adjustable passthrough to allow the user to monitor their audio levels during livestreams or recording sessions. 

While these USB microphones are very similar, in the video above we go through the differences that separate them and name our mic pick for gamers and content creators. 

Audio and voiceover were recorded with each microphone during the relevant sections, and treated with identical post-production settings to ensure a fair comparison.

From Unreal Tournament, BioShock, Batman, Arkham, Final Fantasy VII Remake, to, of course, Fortnite, the Unreal Engine is the backbone of many of our favorite games. Let's take a trip down memory lane to see how far the game development technology has come.  Get a glimpse of how the Unreal Engine has evolved from its first iteration all the way to its fifth iteration. 

Throughout its history, the Unreal Engine has maintained itself as one of the most popular development tools in the games industry. From its early days in the mid 90s, to its powerhouse performance as a games and film visual creation engine, the Unreal Engine has powered many of the most iconic video games over the course of nearly three decades--which includes Gears of War, BioShock, and Fortnite.

In this video, we're taking a look at the evolution of Epic Games' tech. Starting with 1996's Unreal Engine 1 tech demo, we look at how Epic Games'  early tech revolutionized the rendering of 3D environments. Then after, we go over how Unreal Engine 2 took things further by adding improved lighting, detailed character animations, and a greater sense of depth in 3D spaces. From there, the video continues on, from Unreal Engine 3 all the way to the current day where we're now still awaiting the upcoming release of Unreal Engine 5, which adds more realistic visuals and lighting. 

Along with this look back at the advances to the Unreal Engine, we've also published an extensive video on the evolution of PlayStation consoles. For more information on what's to come with the Unreal Engine 5, be sure to check back with GameSpot for more details.
