In this episode, we talk about how I decided to retrofit my 129-year-old house with modern networking. I walk you through the difference between a modem, router, and wi-fi access point, why mesh networks like Google WiFi and Eero don't always yield the best results, the benefits to having wired, RJ45 ethernet in your house wherever you possibly can, and I put it throughout my house! I show how to add new cable drops to your home, how to plan cable runs, how to run a centralized server/network center, gear that you may want to consider using, where to put your wifi access points and more! I show you how to terminate an ethernet cable with an RJ45 connector, tips for stripping cable and using a crimper, how to use a punch-down tool to utilize keystone jacks, and how to verify your wiring is correct using a cable tester. Come join the fun!
