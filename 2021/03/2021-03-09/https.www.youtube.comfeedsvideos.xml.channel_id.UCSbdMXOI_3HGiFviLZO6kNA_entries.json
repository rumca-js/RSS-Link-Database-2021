TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news. This week we have some Quest 2 news (like always it seems) but we also have some odd information on the Quest 3 and 4 and what we can expect from those devices from Mark Zuckerberg himself. More pressing this week is HTC and their announcement of 2, possibly 3 new devices including a new standalone headset this year. The thumbnail is showing a \"proton\" prototype and is not confirmed to be the new headset, but it is the most recent prototype we have seen. Also a new VRMMORPG and some cheap full body tracking coming soon, that and so much more, I hope you enjoy!\n\nMy links-\nHere are my links\nTwitch Stream TODAY!\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nJoin my discord for good times\nhttps://discord.gg/thrill\nPatreon link:Join\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\nGAMERSUPPS Discount Code: THRILL\nhttp://gamersupps.gg/?afmc=thrill\n\nOutro-\nMusic provided by Monstercat: \nMarshmello - Alone\nhttps://youtube.com/monstercat \nhttps://youtube.com/monstercatinstinct\n\nReadyPlayerMe Avatar creator-\nhttps://vrchat.readyplayer.me/avatar\n\nSources-\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/make-your-own-vr-avatar-vrchat-character-creator-tools/\nhttps://vrchat.readyplayer.me/avatar\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/kickstarter-backed-vrmmo-zenith-the-last-city-gets-new-trailer/\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/kickstarter-backed-vrmmo-zenith-the-last-city-gets-new-trailer/\nhttps://vrscout.com/news/create-vrchat-avatar-ready-player-me/\nhttps://uploadvr.com/htc-lip-tracking-tease/\nhttps://uploadvr.com/zuckerberg-quest-3-4-eye-face-tracking/\nhttps://uploadvr.com/htc-vive-tease/\nhttps://uploadvr.com/htc-vive-cosmos-play-update/\nhttps://uploadvr.com/competition-facebook-apple/\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors\nhttps://www.stonx.me/shop/product/cookie-body-tracking-180?tm=\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/swedish-teens-start-up-brings-us-the-most-affordable-vr-full-body-tracking-ever/\nhttps://www.pocket-lint.com/ar-vr/news/htc/156044-htc-is-planning-a-standalone-vr-headset-in-2021-but-it-won-t-rival-oculus-quest", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDENpob4xGg", "date_published": "2021-03-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
