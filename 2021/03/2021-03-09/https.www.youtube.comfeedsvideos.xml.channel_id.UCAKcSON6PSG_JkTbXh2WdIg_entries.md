One year ago today, on March 9, 2020, Best Coast visited The Current studio just as the spread of the coronavirus pandemic was gathering pace in the United States. They had recently released the album, "Always Tomorrow," which frontperson Bethany Cosentino explained is a hopeful title. "I think the overall theme of the album is very much the idea that at times we can be our own worst enemies, and learning to get out of our way and let life happen," she says.

Did life ever happen just days after that. But one year on, we look ahead to a brighter future as we share this fantastic three-song set from Best Coast, recorded live in our studio on March 9, 2020.

6:52 "Everything Has Changed"

## Listen to Looch: the untold story of Parliament Funkadelic

Mary Lucia talks about "Tear the Roof Off: the untold story of Parliament Funkadelic." You know when you're watching a doc and it's got "untold" or "the real story," it's going to be told probably by people that weren't the main players. But this documentary is amazing because Parliament were the kind of band the likes of which there may never be another.

A number of members of Parliament Funkadelic are interviewed, including Billy Bass Nelson, who coined the name Funkadelic. George Clinton was undisputedly a genius, but the way he may have treated his bandmates does get called into question.

"Tear the Roof Off: the untold story of Parliament Funkadelic" is streaming now on Amazon Prime, YouTube and other platforms.

Burk Uzzle has enjoyed a decades-long career as a photojournalist, where his work including photography of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and documenting the Civil Rights movement. Uzzle now lives in Wilson, N.C., where he primarily works in art photography with strong anti-racist themes.

The Woodstock photo, which captured Bobbi Kelly and Nick Ercoline — who have now been married since 1971 — as they embraced at dawn on a hillside at Max Yasgur's dairy farm, the site of the Woodstock music festival, may be Uzzle's most well-known work. But it's not the experience he cherishes the most, as he tells Mary Lucia in the interview above.
