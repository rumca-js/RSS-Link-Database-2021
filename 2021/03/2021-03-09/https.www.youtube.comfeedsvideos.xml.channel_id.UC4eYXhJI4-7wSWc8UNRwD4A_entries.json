Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | March 10, 2021\nOver the years, African musicians have elevated expectations at the Tiny Desk. The distinctive vibrations left by artists like Burna Boy, KOKOKO! and the Soweto Gospel Choir have lead to some of the most unforgettable moments in our rich history. This (home) concert feels like the culmination of all of those moments.\n\nTo celebrate the new compilation Rhythms of Zamunda: Music Inspired By Coming 2 America, six artists representing four countries in Africa perform a megamix of selections from the project. Each performance from the pan-African project bridges the distance between the countries and cultures, and gets more exhilarating by the minute.\n\nSouth Africa's Nasty C \u2014 who's arguably the biggest rapper on the continent \u2014 opens the set and trades verses with Tiny Desk alumni Ari Lennox on \"Black and White.\" He then sends us over to Cameroon for some Afrobeats flavor, courtesy of Locko and his stripped-down version of \"Magnet.\" We then circle back around to South Africa to hear from R&B newcomer Ricky Tyler. From there, we head north to Nigeria to do the \"Jiggy Bop\" with Alpha P before we take one last trip to South Africa for award-winning dance DJ and producer Prince Kaybee's \"Fetch Your Life,\" featuring Msaki. Finally, Togo duo Toofan dares us not to dance to \"Y\u00e9 Mama.\"\n\nIn addition to the sweeping range of the showings, the look of each set is stunning: vibrant, opulent colors; meticulous Tiny Desk shelf recreations; gorgeous African artifacts; and a few nuggets dedicated to King Akeem of Coming 2 America. This cultural clash is the biggest amplification of African voices we've ever had the pleasure of presenting.\n\nSET LIST\nNasty C (feat.

Thank you so much for asking me to find the tiniest desk I could, and sing unadorned for the first time in too long.\"\n\nWith his guitar and that unadorned voice, Robin Pecknold performs four songs from Fleet Foxes' 2020 album, Shore. It's an album that pays homage to some of the greats that we've lost \u2014 some more recently, including David Berman and Richard Swift, and some long gone but still influential, like Elliott Smith, Curtis Mayfield, Jimi Hendrix and Judee Sill. Robin wrote the songs while driving in the Catskills and (as you hear on \"Going-to-the-Sun Road\") Montana, a place that feels like home.\n\nIt's been a dozen years since Robin Pecknold's first, self-titled Fleet Foxes album, a record filled with harmony that brightened the somewhat dark lyrics. Here, alone, his message comes through even more apparent, and the songs written both before and during the pandemic shine light on darkness. \n\nSET LIST\n\"Going-to-the-Sun-Road\"\n\"Sunblind\"\n\"Featherweight\"\n\"I'm Not My Season\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nRobin Pecknold: guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Fortress Entertainment, Riley Burke, Tristan Seniuk, Sean Pecknold\nAudio: Jarvis Taveniere\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#fleetfoxes #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko5yZHAiKTU", "date_published": "2021-03-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
