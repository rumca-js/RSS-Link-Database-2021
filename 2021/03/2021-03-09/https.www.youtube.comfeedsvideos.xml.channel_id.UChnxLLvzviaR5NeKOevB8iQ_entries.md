Once upon a time I took a bunch of my tracks and turned them into a "playable" Ableton Live set. This video goes over how that works, what I did, and what I would do differently.
Patrons can download the entire set here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/48580009
The album I made with this set, In Control, is here: https://soundvision.bandcamp.com/album/in-control
