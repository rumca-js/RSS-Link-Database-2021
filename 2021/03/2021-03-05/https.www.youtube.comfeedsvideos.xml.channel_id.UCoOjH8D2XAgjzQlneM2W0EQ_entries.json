Greece was drowning in debt and was on the verge of defaulting on that debt, and going bankrupt. The Greek Parliament announced massively unpopular austerity measures. The Greek Parliament approved these nasty austerity measures in exchange for a $140 billion dollar bailout by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. \n\nThere\u2019s a ton of trading activity in the US stock market. Volatility in the stock market was so high that the New York Stock Exchange had to force trading to slow down. A stock trader grew sick of these high frequency trading firms that have grown to dominate the market over the years. Navinder Sarao decided this would be the day he would go up against them head on and he started \u201cspoofing\u201d the market. He flooded the market with a bunch of sell orders, to trigger those algorithms from the high frequency trading firms causing them to sell, their selling would trigger more selling from other firms, crashing the market. \n\nBloomberg releases this alert. Good news - if you saw that and you thought, hmm, I should buy some HP stock bc it\u2019s probably gonna go up. You\u2019d be correct - but you\u2019d be too late bc this is what happened in the next four seconds of the alert going out. The HFT algorithms do what\u2019s called Sentiment Analysis. You can bet that HFT firms are doing this right now in places like Wall Street Bets and Stocktwits\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to buy GameStop at $10 to keep things simple. However, if I\u2019m a HFT and I want to make money off of your order, all I have to do is get your order before all the other sellers see it. I know you\u2019re looking to buy at $10, so I go to the other sellers who haven\u2019t seen that there\u2019s another buyer at $10 bc I\u2019m faster than you, and I buy from them at $9.99, a cheaper price, and then come back to you and sell it for $10. Imagine the profits bigger firms are raking in.\n\n-----------------------\n\nNo Spirit - Forest Lake Walk https://chll.to/49da79e5 \nNo Spirit - Slightly Improvised https://chll.to/6347930b \n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
