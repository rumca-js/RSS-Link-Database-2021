Three years ago today, singer-songwriter Caitlyn Smith visited our studio to play songs from "Starfire," the album she released that year. Last March, Smith released her latest album, "Supernova."

Although she's been based in Nashville for many years now, Smith grew up in Cannon Falls, Minn., and is a founding member of The Current. We were delighted to welcome her to The Current studio in 2018 as a performing artist. Watch two songs from that session above.

## Sudan Archives - three songs at The Current (2020)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCh1_XIsszg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCh1_XIsszg)
 - RSS feed: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg

One year ago today — in one of the last studio sessions before the pandemic took hold — Sudan Archives performed at The Current.

Sudan Archives — aka Brittney Parks — was born in Cincinnati and classically trained in violin. Now based in Los Angeles, Sudan Archives uses a complex system of drum loops and effects to propel her music beyond classification.

Throughout her set in The Current studio, she consistently cooked up a savory roux of genres: folk, ambient, hip-hop, classical, and contemporary R&B. It is the contrasting mixture of cultures that defines the sound of Sudan Archives. Watch those performances above.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Did You Know"
3:22 "Nont For Sale"
7:10 "Pelicans in the Summer"
