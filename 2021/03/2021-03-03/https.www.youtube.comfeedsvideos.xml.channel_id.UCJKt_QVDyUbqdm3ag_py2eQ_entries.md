"Dreamland Level" by Basehead (Dan GardopÃ©e). This was intended for Jazz Jackrabbit 2, but was left unused.

Made using real A1200 Rev. 1D.4 audio. Playback from DeliTracker 2.34 with 14Bit-NotePlayer 4.30:
- 14-bit calibrated Paula output
- Normal mixing with 44336 Hz mixing frequency
- No panning, no 3D and DSP off. Anti-click enabled
- Module reports 29 channels
- 100% flawless playback not guaranteed (the IT replayer is not perfect)
