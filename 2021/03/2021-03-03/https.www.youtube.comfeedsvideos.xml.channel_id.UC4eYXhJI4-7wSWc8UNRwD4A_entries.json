Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | March 4, 2021\nUsing an Edison \"Fireside\" cylinder phonograph and his own Stratus music software, \u00d3lafur Arnalds' Tiny Desk (home) concert brings the past and the future into a heartfelt performance. Filmed in his tree-lined studio in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland (the former studio of Sigur R\u00f3s), \u00d3lafur and his string quartet perform three songs from my personal No. 1 album of 2020, some kind of peace. The pensive set opens with an older tune, \"Happiness Does Not Wait,\" with \u00d3lafur Arnalds seated at a short upright piano known as a Danish 'pianette.'\n\nThe delicate performance is the perfect window into this Icelandic composer's profound and passionate music. The Edison wax cylinder that we hear on \"Woven Song\" is a traditional Amazonian healing song sung by the late shaman Herlinda Agustin Fernandez.\nLook closely at the piano toward the back of the studio during the tune \"Spiral,\" and you'll see a piano playing seemingly without a performer. That piano is reacting to \u00d3lafur Arnald's real-time performance using algorithms he and his coder friend, Halld\u00f3r Eldj\u00e1rn, developed. He used it extensively when he came and performed his Tiny Desk concert at NPR in 2018. \u00d3lafur Arnalds is a gentle subversive of 21st century music, and I'm so grateful to be able to present his enchanting sounds.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Happiness Does Not Wait\"\n\"Woven Song\"\n\"Spiral\"\n\"We Contain Multitudes\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\u00d3lafur Arnalds: piano\nGeir\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0ur \u00c1sa Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir: violin\nSigr\u00fan Har\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir: violin\nKarl James Pestka: violin\nUnnur J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir: cello\n\nCREDITS\nAudio: \u00d3lafur Arnalds, Hafsteinn \u00der\u00e1insson\nVideo: Blair Alexander\nLocal Production: \u00c1rni \u00de\u00f3r \u00c1rnason\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#olafurarnalds #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB2p5Oaa5Js", "date_published": "2021-03-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Jack Harlow: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | March 3, 2021\nJack Harlow's Tiny Desk (home) concert feels like the arrival of a rap superstar. Tucked in a homey-looking space in Los Angeles surrounded by bookshelves and vintage furniture, the Louisville, Ky., emcee delivers a performance with the confidence of an old pro. His set, however, is the first time he's relied solely on live instrumentation to bring his songs to life. \"It's been a long time since I had a chance to perform and I've never done it like this,\" he says.\n\nThis is a far stretch from the kid with loose curls and specs frolicing with his hometown friends, but his success should serve as a reminder of the importance of artist development. He's been able to slow cook for a few years, consistently dropping mixtapes and visuals until he landed a big hit last year in \"WHATS POPPIN.\" That performance earned him a Grammy nomination ahead of his very impressive debut album, Thats What They All Say.\n\nFor this turn at the Tiny Desk, Harlow, his band and some background singers deliver a megamix of highlights from the album. The orchestration underscores his sentimental and introspective side on songs like \"Same Guy\" and \"Funny Seeing You Here,\" but it also elevates the melody, which is the true hero here. Over the past few years, the 22-year-old rapper has steadily ticked the boxes for a successful career, and this showing undoubtedly checks the performer section.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Rendezvous\"\n\"21C / Delta\"\n\"Funny Seeing You Here\"\n\"Same Guy\"\n\"Creme/ONCE MAY COMES\"\n\"Whats Poppin\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJack Harlow: vocals\nO'Neil \"Doctor O\" Palmer: keys\nRico Nichols: drums\nJoe Cleveland - bass\nRob Gueringer: guitar\nErik B: vocals\nChimera Patrice: vocals\nPorcha Clay: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Ace Pro, Chadrick Fellers / WastedPotential, Donald Turner, Karis West, Kylie Hazzard\nAudio: Nickie Jon Pab\u00f3n, CJ Blair\nPlayback: Kenny Woods\nBackline: Jonathan Castillo\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#jackharlow #tinydesk #hiphop #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNrerhak_pY", "date_published": "2021-03-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
