Latest on Vitamin D
https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng187/chapter/Recommendations

Basically, consider 400 units (10 mcg) per day

But, NHS mid Essex

Routine screening of vitamin D levels and prescribing of Vitamin D is not advisable. 

Both clinical symptoms and risk factors must be present before measuring Vitamin D levels (25OHD).

As yet there is no clear evidence to prove the risks from non-symptomatic Vitamin D deficiency. 

Adults

Vitamin D levels less than 30nmol/L (12ng / ml)

Oral capsules, 40,000 units (1,000 mcg or 1 mg) colecalciferol weekly for 7 weeks

(400 units per day = 2,800 units per week)

Vitamin D levels 30 – 50 nmol/L (12 – 20 ng / ml)

Buy your own, 400 units per day

Vitamin D levels more than 50 nmol/L (20 ng / ml)

Buy your own, consider, 400 units per day

Vitamin K1

Phylloquinone

Involved in blood coagulation (1929)

Found in plant foods like leafy greens

Vitamin K2

https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminK-HealthProfessional/



https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-k2#what-it-is

Menaquinones

Mostly bacterial origin

Animal-based and fermented foods

Adult vitamin K Adequate Intakes, 90 -120 mcg

Fermented foods

Sauerkraut

Natto

High fat dairy from grass fed cows

Eggs

Animal organs

Gut bacteria

Antibiotics

Vitamin K might play a role, osteoporosis and coronary heart disease

Vitamin K2 supplements may improve bone and heart health, while vitamin K1 has no significant benefits

May prevent tissue calcification

Prevalence of hypercalcemia related to hypervitaminosis D in clinical practice

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26995293/

Determine the concentrations of 25-OH-vitamin D at which the risk of hypercalcemia

N = 25,567

Hypervitaminosis D was defined at serum 25-OH-vitamin D more than160 nmol/L (64 ng / ml)

Results: 

382 samples were identified as the first record of hypervitaminosis D

39 presented hypercalcemia (10.2%)

Some had 25-OH-vitamin D levels between 161 and 375 nmol/L.

(most subjects presented hypercalcemia at serum concentrations of 25-OH-vitamin D less than 375 nmol/L, 150 ng / ml)

In 15 subjects, hypercalcemia could be directly attributed to vitamin D

In no case, serum calcium achieved concentrations considered as critical values (more than13 mg/dl).

Conclusion

Hypercalcemia due to vitamin D represented less than 4% of the total hypervitaminosis D detected

Less than 0.1% of the tests performed.

No strong evidence proves that moderate amounts of vitamin D are harmful without an adequate intake of vitamin K. However, research is ongoing, and the picture might become clearer in the near future.

President Biden

Enough vaccines for every adult by the end of May

Two months earlier than expected

100 in 100 well on track

About 1.74 million per day

Merck now helping Johnson & Johnson

We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May

the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War Two

Stay vigilant

this fight is far from over

VOCs

We cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable

We can't assume that

Vaccines for children

https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-february-28-2021-n1259095

Dr. Fauci, MD, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Children under 12 years very likely, end of 2021 or beginning of 2022

Based on, 

If you project realistically when we'll get enough data to be able to say that elementary school children will be able to be vaccinated, I would think that would be, at the earliest, the end of the year, and very likely, the first quarter of 2022
 
High school students will likely be able to get vaccinated this fall

Closer to herd immunity

Encouraged Americans to continue to wear face masks, avoid crowds, and follow social distancing guidelines

you've got to get that baseline down lower than it is now

VOCs emerging in California and New York

Texas

Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz

Austria would work with Israel and Denmark on second generation vaccines

no longer rely on the EU in the future

European Medicines Agency, too slow

We must therefore prepare for further mutations and should no longer be dependent only on the EU for the production of second-generation vaccines

Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen

Bid for supplies of Israel’s leftover vaccines

Mr Kurz and Ms Frederiksen going to Israel

Poland

Talking to China about supplies


Slovakia

Two million doses of the Sputnik delivered (not been approved by the European Medicines Agency)

Hungary

Already approved and bought 2 million doses of Sputnik

We’ve sought to do something together that we could have managed more successfully on an individual basis – take a look at the examples of Britain or Serbia


France

Germany

Advise, 1g paracetamol before and for every 6 hours after vaccination if minor side effects appear

First, there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. WHO doesn’t recommend limiting trade and movement.
