Four years ago today, English singer songwriter Amber Bain — known professionally as The Japanese House — visited The Current studio to play a set of songs following a show in Minneapolis.

Bain shared the story of the name The Japanese House, and it's a titanic tale, if you will. "The reason I'm called The Japanese House is because we stayed in Kate Winslet's house — not because we know her!" Bain explained. "She was just renting it out. The house is called 'The Japanese House' and I was kind of thinking of weird things to name myself, because I didn't want to use my name."

Watch two songs from The Japanese House's 2017 studio session.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Face Like Thunder"
4:17 "Clean"

PERSONNEL
Amber Bain – vocals, guitar

Mary Lucia talks about the new series, "Framing Britney Spears," produced by the New York Times and streaming on Hulu and FX. The documentary explores Spears' career as well as the movement rallying against Britney Spears' court-mandated conservatorship. 

"It's an examination of pop culture and what it can do to somebody that is so young that gets this success this early," Mary says.
