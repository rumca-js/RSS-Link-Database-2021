Let's see if I can get 16 janky old hard drives connected to 1 Raspberry Pi and make a giant RAID volume.

Well, not that giant, because these are janky old drives and none of them are more than 300 GB.

I'll be using the Broadcom MegaRAID card featured in my 'Hardware RAID on Raspberry Pi' video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zpfq8ZC2hyI

Here are affiliate links to the incredible (and incredibly *cheap*) drives I'm using in this video:

Thanks again to Broadcom for sending me the MegaRAID card and storage enclosure!

I asked Red Shirt Jeff to repair one of the SAS drives that was not spinning up. This is what he did.

Special thanks to the 'overkillbros', Thomas and Joe, from Germany, who sent me this drive (and four more that still worked :).
