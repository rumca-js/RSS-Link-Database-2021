Three years ago today, singer-songwriter Caitlyn Smith visited our studio to play songs from "Starfire," the album she released that year. Last March, Smith released her latest album, "Supernova."

Although she's been based in Nashville for many years now, Smith grew up in Cannon Falls, Minn., and is a founding member of The Current. We were delighted to welcome her to The Current studio in 2018 as a performing artist. Watch two songs from that session above.
