Today, we track the entire life of Legolas: living in Mirkwood, his adventures as a member of the Fellowship, and his actions after the Return of the King.  Known for his fighting abilities and great senses, he comes to befriend the unlikeliest of companions - Gimli the Dwarf.  We will also cover his likely age as we look at his actions in the books.  Just as notable as his deeds during The Lord of the Rings are his actions after Sauron's fall, as he helps rebuild Minas Tirith and ultimately sails west with his best friend.
