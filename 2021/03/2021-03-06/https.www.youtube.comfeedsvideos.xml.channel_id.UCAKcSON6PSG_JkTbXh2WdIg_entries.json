Last March, Smith released her latest album, \"Supernova.\"\n\nAlthough she's been based in Nashville for many years now, Smith grew up in Cannon Falls, Minn., and is a founding member of The Current. We were delighted to welcome her to The Current studio in 2018 as a performing artist. Watch two songs from that session above.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Starfire\"\n4:37 \"St. Paul\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nCaitlyn Smith \u2013 vocals, guitar\nPaul Moak \u2013 electric guitar, backing vocals\nSteve Bosmans \u2013 electric guitar, backing vocals\nRollie Gaalswyk \u2013 acoustic guitar, backing vocals\nKara Laudon \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals\nPhil Hicks \u2013 bass, backing vocals\nLevi Stugelmeyer \u2013 drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2017 Local Current story:\nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2017/11/caitlyn-smith-talks-about-chasing-that-perfect-song-from-cannon-falls-to-nashville/\n2018 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/03/05/caitlyn-smith-performs-in-the-current-studio-live-music\n2018 Guitar Collection interview:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/03/15/talking-guitars-and-songwriting-with-caitlyn-smith\n2018 (April) feature story:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/04/18/caitlyn-smith-comes-home-cannon-falls\n2018 (August) feature story:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/08/28/from-state-fair-to-starfire-caitlyn-smith-recalls-minnesota-state-fair-talent-show\n2020 interview with Jill Riley: https://blog.thecurrent.org/2020/03/caitlyn-smith-im-keeping-my-eyes-on-the-future/\n2020 virtual session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/06/15/live-virtual-session-caitlyn-smith\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#caitlynsmith #caitlynsmithmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9hGFV_vhc4", "date_published": "2021-03-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Tash Sultana - I Am Free (live performance)", "description": "Watch Tash Sultana perform \"I Am Free,\" a track from their new album, Terra Firma, released February 19, 2021 on Lonely Lands Records.
