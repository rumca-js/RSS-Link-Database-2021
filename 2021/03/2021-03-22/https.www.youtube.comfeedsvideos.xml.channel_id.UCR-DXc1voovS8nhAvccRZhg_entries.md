The Raspberry Pi can now boot off NVMe drives nativelyâ€”assuming you have the right hardware.

NVMe Boot is currently in beta, but will hopefully be available on all Compute Module 4's soon! This is the fastest way to run a Raspberry Pi, but is it better than just using an NVMe SSD using a USB 3.0 adapter on the Pi 4 model B? Watch the video and find out!
