Maybe it's because BioWare has finally confirmed that they're working on the next instalment in the franchise, or maybe it's because the remaster of the beloved trilogy is right around the corner. In any case, Lucy has Mass Effect on the brain.\n\nWhile waiting for the Legendary Edition, she's gone back to playing Mass Effect Andromeda and has made a list of things that the next Mass Effect could take from both the original trilogy, as well as Andromeda, as well as changes she'd love to see BioWare make with their sci-fi epic. From where in the timeline the story will take place (hopefully as a sequel to Andromeda and the trilogy) as well as which characters we should definitely leave behind (cough, Shepard), it's an exhaustive list of Mass Effect goodness. She covers characters, gameplay changes, and even broaches the subject of day one DLC.\n\nIf you're a Mass Effect fan, make sure to head over to youtube.com/GameSpot, where we'll have loads more Mass Effect videos coming out in the weeks leading up to the release of Mass Effect Legendary Edition on May 14.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLIkAmaoQDo", "date_published": "2021-03-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "25 Years Of Resident Evil", "description": "Resident Evil is 25 years old today, and to celebrate its undying life, here are 25 reasons to love the iconic survival horror franchise.\n\n25 years ago today, Resident Evil clawed its way into the gaming medium, paving way for the survival-horror genre as we know it. Originally launching on the first PlayStation back in 1996, Resident Evil has since spawned 28 games, including critically acclaimed sequels like Resident Evil 4 and its renowned remakes.\n\nThroughout its undying life, Resident Evil has introduced us to an iconic cast of characters like Leon S. Kennedy, Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Ada Wong, and, of course, the ever-charming Barry Burton. Since the franchise\u2019s dawn, it reinvented itself and the horror genre, revolutionizing from fixed camera angles and tank controls, to an over-the-shoulder perspective in Resident Evil 4 that influenced games like Gears of War and Batman: Arkham Asylum.\n\nTo celebrate Resident Evil\u2019s 25th anniversary, we\u2019ve created a list of 25 reasons to love its undying place in games. From its masterfully orchestrated horror, like Mr. X\u2019s first appearance or Jack Baker bursting through a wall in Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, to the more quirky, like its Japanese musical Biohazard: Voice of Gaia, and its, at times, very silly dialogue.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to love, and thankfully there\u2019ll be more to love in the future with the release of Resident Evil: Village and the already fan-favorite lady Alcina Dimitrescu.\n\n#ResidentEvil #ResidentEvil25th #ResidentEvilVillage", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qER5UHITvJI", "date_published": "2021-03-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Razer & HyperX's Budget $50 Headphones - Which Is Best?", "description": "HyperX Cloud Stinger: https://bit.ly/3sh4OD6\nRazer Kraken X: https://bit.ly/3c7kzXE\n\nWe look at the cheapest gaming headphone offerings from Razer and HyperX, both running $50, and decide which is the best product.\n\nIt's easy to break the bank when shopping for audio gear like headphones, but both Razer and HyperX have released competing wallet-friendly options. The Razer Kraken X and the Kingston HyperX Cloud Stinger are both on the market for roughly $50, but which is better?\n\nIn this video we go over some important factors like build quality including weight and materials, audio features, and microphone quality. The Razer set also comes with a piece of bonus software for its 7.1 surround sound software, which seems to work reasonably well at imitating true 7.1 surround. The headsets do come out almost evenly, so some of the factors might be worth more in your personal preference.
