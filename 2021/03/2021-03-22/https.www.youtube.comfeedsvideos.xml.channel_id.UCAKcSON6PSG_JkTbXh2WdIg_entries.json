Three years after playing guitar with 3RDEYEGIRL and Prince, Grantis released her debut solo album, \"Diamonds & Dynamite.\"\n\nAfter Prince's death in 2016, Grantis spent time living in New York and Los Angeles before deciding to settle in Minneapolis and focus on her solo career. She found local bandmates to fit the project \u2014 Cody McKinney (bass), JT Bates (drums), Bryan Nichols (organ), and Suphala (tabla) \u2014 after \"hanging out in Minneapolis for a couple months at First Avenue and Icehouse,\" Grantis said.\n\nFor the session at The Current, Grantis and crew brought their own lighting; they darkened the room, covered the windows, and flipped on blue LED bars. \"It feels a little uncomfortable for me to play rock riffs in bright light,\" Grantis explained to host Mark Wheat with a laugh, later revealing that it was Prince who inspired her to reach beyond music and find ways to get creative with performance. Watch two songs from that session.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Mr. Majestic\"\n4:53 \"Trashformer\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nDonna Grantis \u2013 guitar\nCody McKinney \u2013 bass\nJT Bates \u2013 drums\nBryan Nichols \u2013 organ\nSuphala \u2013 tabla\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Matt Lentz\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2017 interview:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/04/21/3rdeyegirl-guitarist-donna-grantis-calls-the-twin-cities-home\n2017 Theft of the Dial:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/04/21/theft-of-the-dial-donna-grantis-of-3rdeyegirl\n2017 article: \nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2017/06/3rdeyegirl-guitarist-donna-grantis-announces-debut-show-with-new-band/\n2019 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/03/22/donna-grantis-performs-brand-new-music-in-the-currents-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#donnagrantis", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wN3MQwSXnY", "date_published": "2021-03-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Interview: Cannons", "description": "Cannons' three members--Michelle Joy, Ryan Clapham, and Paul Davis connect with Zeke to talk about what they'd play on the radio if they were DJs, their aspirations for the band, and what they've been up to this year.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#cannons", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCQ_IrChdto", "date_published": "2021-03-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
