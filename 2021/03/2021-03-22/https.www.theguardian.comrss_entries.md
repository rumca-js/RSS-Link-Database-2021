## The Guardian view on pandemic politics: we need cooperation, not confrontation | Editorial

<p>Vaccinating the world is the only way out of Covid, but a mixture of nationalism and protectionism is blocking the exit</p><p>Covid-19 has proved to be the greatest humanitarian and economic disaster of the century. A reported 2.7 million people have already died from the pathogen. Its recession is estimated to be <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/understanding-depth-2020-global-recession-5-charts" title="">twice as deep</a> as that associated with the 2008 crash. Ultimately, the only way out of the pandemic is to vaccinate the world. Yet there has been an alarming outbreak of a “my country first” approach to vaccine allocation. In February, the US <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e00fe88e-263c-41da-9ac5-fdbbd71c928a" title="">announced</a> that it would not donate any doses to poor countries until it had a plentiful supply. Fewer than 10 days later, India <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/21/world/serum-institute-india-covid-vaccine.html" title="">cracked</a> down on vaccine exports. These are political decisions, as no one doubts either country’s ability to vaccinate their own populations.</p><p>That is why the EU’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/22/britain-urges-eu-meet-commitments-covid-vaccine-supplies" title="">threat</a> to limit the export of locally produced vaccines is so concerning. Brussels has enough vaccines. Having stumbled, the bloc’s leaders know it looks bad to see doses leaving the EU for Britain, which has already vaccinated half its population. European leaders should realise that only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/22/potential-for-eu-uk-vaccine-collaboration-despite-astrazeneca-row" title="">cooperation</a> can end the pandemic. Without worldwide coordination, there will be no way to get jabs to the 8 billion people on the planet. Vaccinating the globe at once has never been done. “But if we can put a rover on Mars,” the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/05/vaccination-covid-vaccines-rich-nations" title="">wrote in the Guardian</a> this month, “we can surely produce billions of vaccines and save lives on earth.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-pandemic-politics-we-need-cooperation-not-confrontation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Outsourcing catch-up tutoring to teenagers in Sri Lanka is part of a bigger project to weaken, and cheapen, public services </p><p>The erosion of job security and the prospects of millions of UK workers due to casualisation and outsourcing is widely recognised to have transformed the experience of work. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of zero-hours contracts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/03/zero-hours-contracts-uk-record-high" title="">increased fourfold</a>. Such trends are meeting with increased resistance. Last week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/18/a-lot-are-sceptical-uber-drivers-cautious-welcome-over-worker-status" title="">Uber drivers won</a> the right to a minimum hourly wage and holiday pay.</p><p>Through the replacement of permanent staff with service contracts, public sector employers such as the NHS have been part of the shift towards more precarious employment. The exposure of a company that was paying Sri Lankan teenagers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/mar/19/uk-tutoring-scheme-uses-sri-lankan-under-18s-paid-as-little-as-157-an-hour" title="">£1.57 an hour</a> to tutor primary school pupils shows that schools in England are now being pushed down a similar path. Parents and teachers want to make the most of the £1.7bn catch-up fund provided by the government. But as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/mar/07/englands-school-catch-up-scheme-chaotic-and-confusing-say-headteachers" title="">difficulties with the scheme</a> emerge, it seems far from clear that it will boost schools and teachers. On the contrary, the use of public funds to build a system that supplements lessons by qualified teachers with far cheaper ones delivered via the internet, by unqualified people thousands of miles away, could undermine them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-public-sector-jobs-keep-gig-economics-out">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Readers on how to memorialise the thousands who have died in the pandemic and healthcare workers who risk their lives</p><p>On Tuesday, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/13/covid-day-of-reflection-year-after-uk-lockdown-began" title="">mark the anniversary of the first Covid-19 lockdown</a>, we will all stop for a moment to reflect on those we have lost to this dreadful pandemic. Personally, I think of the thousands of people who have died in care settings. Every death is a tragedy, the loss of a loved one – a father, mother, husband, wife, son, daughter, aunt, uncle or friend. Tuesday is also a time to think of and thank all those carers, NHS staff and other key workers who put their lives at risk to care for others. To acknowledge that work, it would be nice if the government could give all health and social care staff in England a <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-gbp500-payment-for-health-and-social-care-staff---questions-and-answers/" title="">bonus</a>, like the £500 payment awarded in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.<br /><strong>Mike Padgham</strong><br /><em>Scarborough, North Yorkshire</em></p><p>• The doctors, nurses and support staff who have been looking after Covid patients in hospitals and care homes for over a year now have a job that is quite different from any other that I can think of, apart from active military service. They go to work daily, knowing that they will be placing themselves in an environment that could kill them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/22/a-tribute-to-key-workers-and-those-lost-to-covid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We would like to hear about the superficially unattractive corners of your neighbourhood you have learned to love</p><p>Desperate to escape our homes, yet unable to stray too far, many of us have learned to love bleak or superficially unattractive corners of our neighbourhoods over the last year. Fly-tipped building sites, muddy towpaths, bramble-lined tracks past scrap heaps and industrial sheds – they have all offered us an escape from the crowds and a place to hear ourselves think. And as the weeks and months have passed, we have seen how life goes in in even the most unpromising of locations, from birds hunting for food and building their nests to flowers pushing through the pavement.</p><p>We’d love to hear about the unlovely areas you’ve come to value – both what you cherish and what might deter a casual visitor. How did you discover it? What humans, animals and plants do you share it with?

<p>Prof Neil Ferguson was one of the first scientists to raise the alarm in Britain that unless the government radically changed policy, it was heading for a disaster that the NHS could not cope with</p><p>When the UK government announced a full national lockdown a year ago, it pointed to a devastating report based on the modelling data of one of Britain’s most influential epidemiologists: Prof Neil Ferguson. It showed that unless the government changed course it was heading for a disaster that could result in the deaths of 250,000 people and the NHS being overwhelmed within weeks. </p><p>Weeks turned into months but, eventually, Britain was able to reopen last summer. Yet cases of Covid-19 surged again. Ferguson tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> that once again there were calls from the scientists for a short “circuit breaker” lockdown that could stem the flow of new cases. In this instance, the government decided not to take the advice, but was forced to implement a second lockdown lasting throughout November. Then when new variants began running rampant, officials moved in January to institute a full third national lockdown that is only now starting to be relaxed. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2021/mar/22/neil-ferguson-covid-year-shattered-way-of-life-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
