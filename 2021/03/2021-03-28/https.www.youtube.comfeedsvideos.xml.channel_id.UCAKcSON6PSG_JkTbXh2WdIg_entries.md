The COVID-19 pandemic has pulled people away from one another, put live music on hiatus, and had far-reaching effects into our local and global communities. During that time, everyone — including us at The Current — has had to rethink how to go about daily life. 

At The Current, we've availed ourselves of technology that allows us to connect with artists around the world and bring them right to your home. None of this would be possible without the support of our members. Thank you for your support of The Current!
