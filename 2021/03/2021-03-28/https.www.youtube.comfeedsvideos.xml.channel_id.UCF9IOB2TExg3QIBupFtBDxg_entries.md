Joint World Health Organization-China report

Coronavirus most likely jumped from animals to humans via an intermediate animal host

Downplays the possibility it leaked from a lab

Recommends further study, path of transmission between animals and humans

Transmission through frozen food

Does not recommend additional research on the lab leak hypothesis

US Secretary of State Antony Blinke

Concerns about the methodology and the process

the fact that the government in Beijing apparently helped to write it

Jake Sullivan, national security

It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government 

To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available it’s data from the earliest days of the outbreak

Much data collected by Chinese scientists, ahead of visit, then analyzed by the joint team

Dominic Dwyer, Australian microbiologist team member

I mean, yes, we did a three-hour visit. 

And it was sort of managed in the sense that there’s a lot of people there, and we do a tour. 

But we did get to ask questions

You could do, if so desired, a more detailed forensic examination

But that is another whole negotiation and discussion

CDC, Right now, I’m scared

Rochelle Walensky

7 day average, about + 60,000 per day

Up 10%

Death rate up 3%

I’m going to lose the script and I’m going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom

We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope. But right now, I’m scared

Infectious diseases physician at Massachusetts General Hospital

U.S. trajectory mirrors the trends a few weeks ago in Europe

Please hold on a little while longer. I so badly want to be done

We are just almost there, but not quite yet

Country does not have the luxury of inaction

UK roadmap

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52530518

The coronavirus vaccine programme continues to go to plan

Vaccines are sufficiently reducing the number of people dying or needing hospital treatment

Infection rates do not risk a surge in hospital admissions

New coronavirus variants do not fundamentally change the risk of lifting restrictions

Population, 213 million

Deaths, + 3,000 (per day)

Andréia Cruz, emergency-ward nurse, Porto Alegre

We’re in the trenches here, fighting a war

P.1 strain, now in 20 countries

Manaus variant

Industrial hub, truck route

Most prevalent variant in Brazil

New York, found last week

Up to 2.2 times more contagious

Up to 61% more able to reinfect people

? increased mortality

Porto Alegre

P.1 at least 60%

Hospitals overwhelmed

Doctors report younger patients

Doctors report fitter patients getting sick

Deaths in Brazil (WSJ analysis)

Under 60 previous peak, 26% of deaths

Under 60s, this peak, 30% of deaths 

Diego Montarroyos Simões, intensive-care doctor, Recife

We’re seeing patients who aren’t obese, who have no comorbidities, who are not old but, even so, the virus just overwhelms them

Problems

US, widespread complacency

Fully vaccinated in Brazil, 1.9%

? further P.1 mutations

William Hanage, Harvard University epidemiologist

There is a rush to declare this pandemic is over, and it’s not

I dread to think what will happen when P.1 manages to get to places that are not likely to get vaccinated for quite some time

Most daily cases per capita ever 

Uruguay, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia

Felipe Naveca, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation

https://portal.fiocruz.br/en

If we don’t stop the virus circulating, it won’t stop evolving

Peru

40% of infections are P.1

Current vaccines, efficacy against P.1?

Preliminary studies

Yes, but possible/probably reduced efficacy
