You are one of the few survivors, a marine with access to an arsenal of weapons. Fight your way through the darkened, claustrophobic corridors of the research facility and into Hell itself to stop the invasion from reaching Earth.  \n\nDOOM 3: VR Edition also includes both expansions \u2013 Resurrection of Evil and The Lost Mission. In The Lost Mission you are the sole survivor of Bravo Team, tasked with destroying a teleportation relay located deep inside Hell capable of sending an army of demons to Earth. Resurrection of Evil takes place two years after the events of DOOM 3 -- you must recover an ancient artifact able to open a portal to Hell and destroy it before the Maledict can use it to exterminate humanity.\n\n#DOOM #DOOM3 #PSVR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTejy_IVL0o", "date_published": "2021-03-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Season Two Reloaded | Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Update", "description": "Check out the official Season Two update video for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Season Two Reloaded!
