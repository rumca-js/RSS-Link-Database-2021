Phil Hornshaw breaks it all down. \n\nDisco Elysium - The Final Cut is releasing on March 30, bringing a free upgrade to PC users and the opportunity for PlayStation 4, PS5, and Stadia players to check out the game for the first time. It's also debuting some pretty huge changes to one of the best games of 2019, including full voice-over support throughout the game and new content.\n\nWe've run down all the changes you can expect to see in Disco Elysium - The Final Cut in the video above. Developer ZA/UM has put in a massive amount of effort in voicing the game, with performances from more than 50 actors all over the world. The developer also detailed how its new political vision quests will work, so expect your character's political alignment to matter a lot more in this new version of the game.\n\nThere are also more improvements to the game's performance, and even some tweaks that bring new Twitch integrations that should make some pretty compelling streams.

You've heard us, and many others, say this before but Xbox's subscription service is easily the best service in video games when it comes to bang for your buck. But it's not just giving people access to a massive library of video games at no additional cost, it's also changing the industry in a number of ways ranging from making content accessible in various places, to giving smaller developers more exposure, and helping some games develop a strong community where they might otherwise struggle.\n\nOne other key thing Game Pass doing is breeding competition, both directly and indirectly. PlayStation and Nintendo players will now begin to think about how much value those platform holders are delivering to them, and the ways in which they can maximize their money and time when it comes to buying and playing games.\u00a0\n\nThat's also a big discussion point in this episode of Console Crew, as Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor discuss Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo's efforts to entice players to play games on their platform and engage with their ecosystems. This comes as a number of high-profile titles from Bethesda are added to Game Pass and Sony updates the list of free titles that will be available as part of its Play at Home campaign. For its part, Nintendo has a library of classics available through Switch Online, but the question is, are Sony and Nintendo's efforts enough to compete with Game Pass? Do they even need to compete, for that matter? Watch to find out what the crew thinks.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpiUFJCbcF0", "date_published": "2021-03-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Genshin Impact Windblume Festival Gameplay", "description": "Genshin Impact recently released their new event in version 1.4, featuring multiple minigames and battles in the Mondstadt Windblume Festival.\n\nMondstadt's Windblume Festival to play fun new games and hang out with Barbara, Chongyun, Bennett and Noelle.\"\n\nAll players who have reached Adventure Rank 20 or above and completed the \"Song of the Dragon and Freedom\" questline are cordially invited to join the citizens of Mondstadt in their annual celebration of freedom and love as dandelion seeds flutter in the warm spring breeze.\n\nAllegedly, the Windblume Festival originated as an occasion to commemorate the liberation of Mondstadt 2,600 years ago. For the citizens of today, however, it has become the season to express true love and participate in all sorts of outdoor games. The Knights of Favonius and the Adventurers' Guild will organize a series of mini-games and challenges for players to enjoy alone or with friends, with generous rewards including two festival-exclusive items \u2014 the Windblume Festival Commemorative Balloon and the Windsong Lyre, as well as a new 4-star weapon, Windblume Ode. Meanwhile, a new type of story quest with multiple endings available will give Travelers the opportunity to spend some quality time hanging out with Barbara, Noelle, Bennett, and Chongyun, creating a rich range of memories together.\nIn Version 1.4, more details about the Abyss Order and the fate of the Traveler's long-lost sibling will be revealed. Travelers who continue their investigation with \"Bough Keeper\" Dainsleif will finally come face to face with the formidable Abyss Herald and learn some surprising secrets about the world's first Ruin Guard at Stormterror's Lair.\n\nTwo months after her first appearance in Dragonspine, \"Thorny Benevolence\" Rosaria will now be joining the game as the latest 4-star playable character. Wielding a polearm and the power of Cryo, Rosaria can quickly maneuver herself behind her enemy to attack from the rear. Her Elemental Burst unleashes a mighty slash, dealing high Cryo DMG, followed by constant bursts of AoE Cryo DMG to nearby enemies over a period of time.\nNew functions and optimizations will also be introduced to improve player experience. In Version 1.4, players can hold up to five Condensed Resin in their Inventory at any one time. Additionally, players can opt to lower their World Level to suit their needs both in Single-Player and Co-Op Mode.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRgLUVBSpLU", "date_published": "2021-03-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "What's Nintendo's Next Console?", "description": "The Nintendo Switch is starting to show its age, and with the rumors of a Switch Pro swirling, the GameSpot After Dark crew attempts to predict Nintendo's next move.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video be sure to listen to the full episode of GameSpot After Dark on a podcast server of your choice.

Let's take a look back at how it's evolved over the series' history.\n\n\nThe M16 assault rifle is no stranger to the Call of Duty series.\u00a0In this trip down memory lane, Richie Bracamonte takes you back through COD history to see it\u2019s\u00a0appearances\u00a0and\u00a0variants.\u00a0From its early\u00a0appearances in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,\u00a0to Activision's latest entry Black Ops Cold War,\u00a0the M16 has\u00a0been in more than a dozen games.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThrough the decades, the in-game gun has kept up with\u00a0its real-life counterparts.\u00a0There have been updates from the base M16\u00a0such as the A1 and A4 variants.\u00a0Although it\u2019s known for accuracy, the M16\u00a0was\u00a0mostly classified as an assault rifle\u00a0until Black Ops Cold War,\u00a0where it falls under the Tactical Rifle class.\u00a0The M16\u00a0has gone back and\u00a0forth between full\u00a0auto and it\u2019s infamous 3-round-burst firing style. While it makes little difference in COD\u2019s story modes,\u00a0this detail\u00a0can\u00a0change the entire meta of online gameplay.\u00a0\n\nToday, the M16 stands tall as one of the most iconic guns in the Call of Duty\u00a0series. It always features\u00a0high accuracy,\u00a0a\u00a0fast fire rate\u00a0and slew of attachments that help its range and precision. If you can handle its kick and line up your shots will enough, the M16 will do all the heavy lifting.
