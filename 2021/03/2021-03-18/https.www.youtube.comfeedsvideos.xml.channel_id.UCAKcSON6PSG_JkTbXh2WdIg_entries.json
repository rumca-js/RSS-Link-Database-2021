A Minnesota musician, Hart is best known for his time as the drummer and co-songwriter of the band H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, but many may not know that Hart's solo career, which began in 1988, lasted far longer than H\u00fcsker D\u00fc.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Hart vacillated between prolific creative output or absence from the public eye. In 2013, Hart released a concept album, \"The Argument,\" that was based on an unpublished work of the late William S. Burroughs, who had adapted John Milton's epic poem \"Paradise Lost\" for the stage. Given those source materials, it's no surprise that \"The Argument\" is a stylistically ambitious album. \"I've always been attracted to the [Milton] line, 'Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n,\" Hart told NPR in 2013. \"There's a revolutionary in me that really loves that kind of thinking.\"\n\nIn 2013, Hart visited The Current studio for a session that aired on The Local Show, which at that time was hosted by David Campbell. Hart played a couple songs from \"The Argument\"; watch those performances above.\n\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Awake, Arise\"\n4:15 \"Is The Sky The Limit?\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nGrant Hart \u2013 vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: David Campbell; Jon Schober\n\nFIND MORE:\n2013 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/07/16/grant-hart-live\n2013 NPR interview: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/07/22/grant-hart-interivew\n2017 obituary:\nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2017/09/songwriter-and-husker-du-founder-grant-hart-passes-away-at-56/\n2017 posthumously published interview with Andrea Swensson:\nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2017/11/the-story-of-husker-dus-beginnings-as-told-by-grant-hart/\n2017 Yanomamos project:\nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2017/12/yanomamos-trio-featuring-grant-hart-on-drums-issue-second-release-after-29-year-gap/\n\"Do You Remember?\" documentary podcast about H\u00fcsker D\u00fc:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/collection/husker-du/ \n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxFMUVnOrO8", "date_published": "2021-03-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Jon Batiste - Virtual Session", "description": "Jon Batiste joins The Current for a virtual session, hear a few recent songs plus a conversation with Sean McPherson about the influence of New Orleans on his music, setting his intentions with Stevie Wonder, and recording music outside of a traditional studio environment.\n\nThis session was previously recorded in front of a live virtual audience of Minnesota Public Radio members.

Here are three songs from that set.\n\nThe band's name is a little goofy, but The Nude Party did in fact, at one time, party and play music naked. There was no pun or any serious symbolism attached to the band name, but rather real experiences involving jamming with friends at North Carolina's Appalachian State University, and playing gigs at the local 505 House \u2014 often involving nudity.\n\nAlthough the six-piece band are now performing fully clothed, their music continues to attract fans with a unique mix of country, punk, blues, and psychedelic rock. Inspired by artists such as Lou Reed, the Who, and Booker T and the MG's, the sextet use these influences to create their own style and sound.\n\nIn October 2020, The Nude Party released their second album, \"Midnight Manor.\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n00:00 \"Feels Alright\"\n03:48 \"Astral Man\"\n10:19 \"Chevrolet Van\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nPatton Magee \u2013 guitar, lead vocals\nShaun Couture \u2013 guitar, vocals\nAlec Castillo \u2013 bass guitar, vocals\nDon Merrill \u2013 organ, piano, vocals)\nAustin Brose \u2013 percussion, vocals\nConnor Mikita \u2013 drums, cowbell\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Patrick Galbreath; Devon Quick; Mary Mathis\nAudio: Corey Schreppel\nProduction: Brett Baldwin; Erik Stromstad\n\nFIND MORE:\n2017 full Day Party set during SXSW: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/03/17/watch-the-nude-party-perform-at-the-current-day-party-sxsw-in-austin-texas\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/08/05/the-nude-party-perform-at-the-current\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thenudeparty #thenudepartyband", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JekauCJuf0", "date_published": "2021-03-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
