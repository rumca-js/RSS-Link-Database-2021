March 18 is the birthdate of the late Grant Hart. A Minnesota musician, Hart is best known for his time as the drummer and co-songwriter of the band Hüsker Dü, but many may not know that Hart's solo career, which began in 1988, lasted far longer than Hüsker Dü.

Following the dissolution of Hüsker Dü, Hart vacillated between prolific creative output or absence from the public eye. In 2013, Hart released a concept album, "The Argument," that was based on an unpublished work of the late William S. Burroughs, who had adapted John Milton's epic poem "Paradise Lost" for the stage. Given those source materials, it's no surprise that "The Argument" is a stylistically ambitious album. "I've always been attracted to the [Milton] line, 'Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n," Hart told NPR in 2013. "There's a revolutionary in me that really loves that kind of thinking."

In 2013, Hart visited The Current studio for a session that aired on The Local Show, which at that time was hosted by David Campbell. Hart played a couple songs from "The Argument"; watch those performances above.

## The Nude Party - three live performances (2019)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JekauCJuf0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JekauCJuf0)

Two years ago today, The Nude Party performed at The Current's Day Party during SXSW 2019 in Austin, Texas. Here are three songs from that set.

The band's name is a little goofy, but The Nude Party did in fact, at one time, party and play music naked. There was no pun or any serious symbolism attached to the band name, but rather real experiences involving jamming with friends at North Carolina's Appalachian State University, and playing gigs at the local 505 House — often involving nudity.

Although the six-piece band are now performing fully clothed, their music continues to attract fans with a unique mix of country, punk, blues, and psychedelic rock. Inspired by artists such as Lou Reed, the Who, and Booker T and the MG's, the sextet use these influences to create their own style and sound.

In October 2020, The Nude Party released their second album, "Midnight Manor."
