So the real question is, is this a bubble?\nThe short answer? Yes\n\nSpeculators are dumping money into anything that is an NFT for the sake of it being an NFT - just like how speculators were throwing money at anything with a dot com in its name, hoping that it\u2019s gonna go up\nNow some of these NFT\u2019s do have the potential to become actual collectibles that go up in price. But real collectibles like trading cards never start out at a high price\nThey start low and gradually go up over time.\n\nWhen you look at the buyers of these expensive NFT\u2019s - what do you find?\nMost were early crypto investors that are sitting on massive gains that they have no idea what to do with. So instead of cashing out and having to pay the tax man, they transfer some of their wealth into these NFT\u2019s.\n\nSo yes, this space is probably in a bubble right now.\nBut then the question becomes, is it going to pop? And if it does pop, are NFT\u2019s here to stay? Do NFT\u2019s even offer any value that would make it last? Or is it just a passing trend?\n\nAt first, the idea of paying money for a jpg or video sounds crazy\nYet\u2026 we\u2019re also the type of creatures to pay sometimes an equally crazy amount of money on consumerism\n\nWhy do we buy all these irrational things? Because of one simple thing: status. We\u2019re social creatures - we want others to know that we have good tastes, that we\u2019re high class - socially relevant.\n\nNFT\u2019s for art and collectibles can actually have a lot of merit. Think about the Beeple collage that just sold for $69.3 million dollars. It\u2019s a culturally relevant artist that millennials and Gen Z love. An NFT art piece that happened to take Beeple 13 years of blood, sweat, and tears to make\n\nSure you can download it off his website? But you and I both know that it\u2019s just not the same - that it\u2019s not authentic\n\nThere are also a ton of other value-adds NFT\u2019s offer to artists\n\nAnother idea for NFT\u2019s is allowing creators, YouTubers, influencers, to basically issue stock through an IPO - here\u2019s how it could work\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
