should continue to receive the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca\n\nFollowing a rigorous scientific review of all the available data\n\nVTE, DVT, PE\n\nAvailable evidence does not suggest that blood clots in veins (venous thromboembolism) are caused by \n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca\n\nConfirmed by the Government\u2019s independent advisory group, the Commission on Human Medicines\n\nCerebral sinus

occur naturally\n\nA causal association with the vaccine has not been established\n\nMHRA\u2019s advice, vaccine continues to outweigh any risks\n\nDr June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive\n\nOur thorough and careful review, \n\nalongside the critical assessment of leading, independent scientists, \n\nshows that there is no evidence that that blood clots in veins is occurring more than would be expected in the absence of vaccination, for either vaccine.\n\nRisk of dying from covid, x 1000 for most people\n\nCSVT \n\nAfter 11 million doses of AZ\n\n1 case in 2.2 million\n\n1 fatality in 11 million\n\nUK, all men\n\na link to the vaccine is unproven\n\nthe benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19, with its associated risk of hospitalisation and death, continue to outweigh the risks of potential side effects.\n\nanyone with a headache that lasts for more than 4 days after vaccination, \n\nor bruising beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, to seek medical attention\n\nmild flu-like symptoms remain one of the most common side effects of any COVID-19 vaccine, \nincluding headache, chills and fever\n\nThese generally appear within a few hours and resolve within a day or two, but not everyone gets them\n\nProfessor Sir Munir Pirmohamed, Chair of the Commission on Human Medicines\n\nRe. 5 cases\n\nFurther work with expert haematologists is under way\n\nto further understand the nature of these cases\n\nand whether there is a causal association with any of the vaccines. \n\nAstraZeneca COVID vaccine, 80% reduction in hospitalisation and

rare blood clots with low blood platelets\n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots\n\nThe benefits of the vaccine in combating the still widespread threat of COVID-19 (which itself results in clotting problems and may be fatal) continue to outweigh the risk of side effects\n\nThe vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots (thromboembolic events)\n(Lower than in unvaccinated groups)\nThere is no evidence of a problem related to specific batches of the vaccine or to particular manufacturing sites\n\nHowever, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e. low levels of blood platelets with or without bleeding, including rare cases of clots in the vessels draining blood from the brain (CVST).\n\n20 million people in the UK and EEA had received AZ (March 16)\n\nDIC, 7 cases\n\nCVST, 18 cases\n\nA causal link with the vaccine is not proven, but is possible and deserves further analysis.\n\nDIC and CVST \n\nReported from Member States, \n\n9 resulted in death (DIC and CVST combined)\n\nMostly under 55s, mostly women\n\nDIC, Based on pre-COVID figures, younger people\n\nExpected, less than 1 case, among people under 50 within 14 days of receiving the vaccine\n\nActual, 5 cases\n\nCVST, younger people\n\nExpected, 1.35 cases\n\nActual, 12 cases\n\nA similar imbalance was not visible in the older population given the vaccine.\n\nResults\n\nNever
