Here are three songs from that set.\n\nThe band's name is a little goofy, but The Nude Party did in fact, at one time, party and play music naked. There was no pun or any serious symbolism attached to the band name, but rather real experiences involving jamming with friends at North Carolina's Appalachian State University, and playing gigs at the local 505 House \u2014 often involving nudity.\n\nAlthough the six-piece band are now performing fully clothed, their music continues to attract fans with a unique mix of country, punk, blues, and psychedelic rock. Inspired by artists such as Lou Reed, the Who, and Booker T and the MG's, the sextet use these influences to create their own style and sound.\n\nIn October 2020, The Nude Party released their second album, \"Midnight Manor.\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n00:00 \"Feels Alright\"\n03:48 \"Astral Man\"\n10:19 \"Chevrolet Van\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nPatton Magee \u2013 guitar, lead vocals\nShaun Couture \u2013 guitar, vocals\nAlec Castillo \u2013 bass guitar, vocals\nDon Merrill \u2013 organ, piano, vocals)\nAustin Brose \u2013 percussion, vocals\nConnor Mikita \u2013 drums, cowbell\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Patrick Galbreath; Devon Quick; Mary Mathis\nAudio: Corey Schreppel\nProduction: Brett Baldwin; Erik Stromstad\n\nFIND MORE:\n2017 full Day Party set during SXSW: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/03/17/watch-the-nude-party-perform-at-the-current-day-party-sxsw-in-austin-texas\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/08/05/the-nude-party-perform-at-the-current\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thenudeparty #thenudepartyband", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JekauCJuf0", "date_published": "2021-03-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Arlo Parks - Green Eyes (live performance)", "description": "Arlo Parks performs \"Green Eyes\" from her debut 2021 record, 'Collapsed In Sunbeams'.

Cold War Kids enjoyed great success in 2015 with their song \"First\"; the song peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and became the band's highest charting single. But being on top also presented its own challenges. \"The scariest thing in the world to me is the idea of having a song do great, riding that wave to the end, and then starting a new record with all of the feelings and expectations that come with that,\" said Cold War Kids' Nate Willett.\n\nBut it was in that context that Cold War Kids, working with producer Lars Stalfors, recorded their next album, \"L.A. Divine,\" which released on April 7, 2017. A few weeks before that release date, Cold War Kids played a sold-out show at First Avenue in Minneapolis and they visited The Current for a stripped-down set. Watch two performances from that studio session.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Love Is Mystical\"\n3:45 \"First\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nNathan Willett \u2013 guitar, vocals\nMatthew Schwartz \u2013 keys, vocals\nMatt Maust \u2013 bass\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Emmet Kowler; Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Elijah Deaton-Berg\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2009 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2009/04/15/cold_war_kids\n2011 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/03/10/cold-war-kids-live\n2013 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/10/02/cold-war-kids-live\n2017 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/03/15/cold-war-kids-preview-la-divine-stripped-down-set-in-the-current-studio\n2020 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/01/24/cold-war-kids-play-a-strippeddown-set-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#coldwarkids", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx1PxZr9go4", "date_published": "2021-03-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Listen to Looch: an intense documentary about Dave Navarro", "description": "Mary Lucia talks about the documentary \"Mourning Son,\" about Dave Navarro, guitar player for Jane's Addiction. \"I've always been a bit intrigued by his darkness, to a point,\" Lucia says. \"There's a reason for it.
