## The Nude Party - three live performances (2019)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JekauCJuf0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JekauCJuf0)

Two years ago today, The Nude Party performed at The Current's Day Party during SXSW 2019 in Austin, Texas. Here are three songs from that set.

The band's name is a little goofy, but The Nude Party did in fact, at one time, party and play music naked. There was no pun or any serious symbolism attached to the band name, but rather real experiences involving jamming with friends at North Carolina's Appalachian State University, and playing gigs at the local 505 House — often involving nudity.

Although the six-piece band are now performing fully clothed, their music continues to attract fans with a unique mix of country, punk, blues, and psychedelic rock. Inspired by artists such as Lou Reed, the Who, and Booker T and the MG's, the sextet use these influences to create their own style and sound.

In October 2020, The Nude Party released their second album, "Midnight Manor."

SONGS PERFORMED
00:00 "Feels Alright"
03:48 "Astral Man"
10:19 "Chevrolet Van"

PERSONNEL
Patton Magee – guitar, lead vocals
Shaun Couture – guitar, vocals
Alec Castillo – bass guitar, vocals
Don Merrill – organ, piano, vocals)
Austin Brose – percussion, vocals
Connor Mikita – drums, cowbell

## Cold War Kids - two songs in The Current studio (2017)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx1PxZr9go4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx1PxZr9go4)
 - RSS feed: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg

Four years ago this week, Cold War Kids visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Mary Lucia. Cold War Kids enjoyed great success in 2015 with their song "First"; the song peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and became the band's highest charting single. But being on top also presented its own challenges. "The scariest thing in the world to me is the idea of having a song do great, riding that wave to the end, and then starting a new record with all of the feelings and expectations that come with that," said Cold War Kids' Nate Willett.

But it was in that context that Cold War Kids, working with producer Lars Stalfors, recorded their next album, "L.A. Divine," which released on April 7, 2017. A few weeks before that release date, Cold War Kids played a sold-out show at First Avenue in Minneapolis and they visited The Current for a stripped-down set. Watch two performances from that studio session.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Love Is Mystical"
3:45 "First"

PERSONNEL
Nathan Willett – guitar, vocals
Matthew Schwartz – keys, vocals
Matt Maust – bass

## Listen to Looch: an intense documentary about Dave Navarro
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXDHw-eQT84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXDHw-eQT84)
 - RSS feed: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg

Mary Lucia talks about the documentary "Mourning Son," about Dave Navarro, guitar player for Jane's Addiction. "I've always been a bit intrigued by his darkness, to a point," Lucia says. "There's a reason for it. This documentary goes through the trauma that Navarro experienced at the age of 15, when his mother and his aunt were both murdered, and the following nine years when the killer was on the lam."

Directed by Navarro's friend, filmmaker Todd Newman, "Mourning Son" is available for streaming on Amazon Prime.
