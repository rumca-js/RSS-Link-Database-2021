## Evolution of the M16 in Call of Duty

The iconic M16 assault rifle has been in more than a dozen Call of Duty games. Let's take a look back at how it's evolved over the series' history.


The M16 assault rifle is no stranger to the Call of Duty series. In this trip down memory lane, Richie Bracamonte takes you back through COD history to see it’s appearances and variants. From its early appearances in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, to Activision's latest entry Black Ops Cold War, the M16 has been in more than a dozen games.  

Through the decades, the in-game gun has kept up with its real-life counterparts. There have been updates from the base M16 such as the A1 and A4 variants. Although it’s known for accuracy, the M16 was mostly classified as an assault rifle until Black Ops Cold War, where it falls under the Tactical Rifle class. The M16 has gone back and forth between full auto and it’s infamous 3-round-burst firing style. While it makes little difference in COD’s story modes, this detail can change the entire meta of online gameplay. 

Today, the M16 stands tall as one of the most iconic guns in the Call of Duty series. It always features high accuracy, a fast fire rate and slew of attachments that help its range and precision. If you can handle its kick and line up your shots will enough, the M16 will do all the heavy lifting. If you enjoyed this evolution, leave a comment for what you’d like to see next time!

While there have been mods over the years to simulate first person in Breath of the Wild, a recent discovery finally allows anyone to glitch the game to play it in first person for the most cinematic and immersive experience.

Breath of the Wild, to this day, continues to have groundbreaking discoveries even 4 years after release. The most recent breakthrough lets players engage a first person mode at any time which gave us some heavy Skyrim vibes.

It is difficult to perform though, and we break it down with our hands on camera so you can see the difficult portions being done. This requires a multitude of glitches, including Menu Overloading, Item Hold Smuggling, and Model Teleporting to perform, but if done correctly, is well worth it for a more immersive and cinematic Breath of the Wild experience than ever before on Nintendo Switch.
