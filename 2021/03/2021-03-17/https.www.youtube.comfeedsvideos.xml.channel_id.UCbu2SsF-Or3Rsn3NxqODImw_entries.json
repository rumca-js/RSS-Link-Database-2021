Let's take a look back at how it's evolved over the series' history.\n\n\nThe M16 assault rifle is no stranger to the Call of Duty series.\u00a0In this trip down memory lane, Richie Bracamonte takes you back through COD history to see it\u2019s\u00a0appearances\u00a0and\u00a0variants.\u00a0From its early\u00a0appearances in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,\u00a0to Activision's latest entry Black Ops Cold War,\u00a0the M16 has\u00a0been in more than a dozen games.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThrough the decades, the in-game gun has kept up with\u00a0its real-life counterparts.\u00a0There have been updates from the base M16\u00a0such as the A1 and A4 variants.\u00a0Although it\u2019s known for accuracy, the M16\u00a0was\u00a0mostly classified as an assault rifle\u00a0until Black Ops Cold War,\u00a0where it falls under the Tactical Rifle class.\u00a0The M16\u00a0has gone back and\u00a0forth between full\u00a0auto and it\u2019s infamous 3-round-burst firing style. While it makes little difference in COD\u2019s story modes,\u00a0this detail\u00a0can\u00a0change the entire meta of online gameplay.\u00a0\n\nToday, the M16 stands tall as one of the most iconic guns in the Call of Duty\u00a0series. It always features\u00a0high accuracy,\u00a0a\u00a0fast fire rate\u00a0and slew of attachments that help its range and precision. If you can handle its kick and line up your shots will enough, the M16 will do all the heavy lifting. If you enjoyed this evolution,\u00a0leave a comment for what you\u2019d like to see next time!\u00a0\n\nGuns featured list: https://redventures-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/rbracamonte/ERBgHVejdfpAm6mhWKFoyS4BZBBvNE6Am0CstazTXmU7bg?e=GHoK13\n\nTimestamps:\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:17 - Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\n01:04 - Modern Warfare 2\n01:27 - Black Ops 1\n01:41 - Black Ops 1 Zombies\n02:04 - Modern Warfare 3\n02:29 - Black Ops 2\n02:45 - Black Ops 2 Zombies\n03:02 - Advanced Warfare\n03:35 - Black Ops 3 Zombies\n03:53 - Modern Warfare Remastered\n04:19 - Black Ops 4\n04:33 - Black Ops 4 Zombies\n05:05 - Call of Duty Mobile\n05:25 - Modern Warfare 2 Remastered\n06:13 - Black Ops Cold War\n07:00 - Black Ops Cold War Zombies", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3REEHYjFwc", "date_published": "2021-03-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Forspoken (Project Athia) Teaser Trailer | Square Enix Presents", "description": "Acrobatics and super powered abilities galore in this reveal trailer for a brand new IP from Square Enix, Forspoken (formerly known as Project Athia)!
