Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAbby O\u2019Neill | March 22, 2021\nMusic icon\u00a0Sting\u00a0returns to Tiny Desk with a new collaborator in tow, and the story is heartwarming. During the pandemic, Beninese pop star\u00a0Shirazee\u00a0adapted his own rendition of Sting's classic \"Englishman in New York\" into \"African in New York.\" His version made its way to Sting, who loved it so much that he asked Shirazee to lend his voice to his Tiny Desk (home) concert and record for his new\u00a0Duets\u00a0album.\n\nTheir chemistry feels natural and just as comforting as this long overdue sunshine after a grueling winter. Shot in a lounge in NYC where Sting's presently recording another album, these two gentlemen share a touching moment between songs, expressing their mutual admiration and discussing the sheer joy about a simple concept \u2013 performing in a room together after 12 long months of isolation and virtual collaborations.\n\nAs a follow up, Sting jumps into a stunning acoustic performance of \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You,\" another one of his many classics. The timbre of his voice conjures a sense of carefree familiarity, reminiscent of times with more levity and peace. His finale, \"Sister Moon,\" is a gem from his 1987 solo album,\u00a0Nothing Like the Sun,\u00a0that rarely gets performed live.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Englishman/African in New York\"\n \u2022 \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\"\n \u2022 \"Sister Moon\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Sting: vocals, guitar\n \u2022 Shirazee: vocals\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video:\u00a0Modern Day Auteur, Franz Brun, Martin Kierszenbaum\n \u2022 Audio: Tony Lake\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Abby O'Neill\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#sting #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87_1W4P1F2A", "date_published": "2021-03-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
