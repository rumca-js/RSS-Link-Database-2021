We can’t be deaf and blind to what’s going on outside the United Kingdom

ZOE has found no link found between COVID vaccination and risk of blood clots

Tim Spector

After steady falls at the beginning of the week, we've seen cases levelling off in recent days, 

especially in Scotland, Wales and the North-East of England. 

This is to be expected after reopening schools across the country and is no reason to worry. 

We’re keeping a close eye on cases in school-aged children and so far there’s nothing alarming about the data.

I believe we'll see case numbers holding steady for a little while before cases drop again.

Russian death toll

Cases, 4.4 million

Deaths, 93,457

Population, 144 million

Most restrictions lifted in June, 2020

Facemasks mostly worn in public

Demographer Alexei Raksha

If Russia stops at 500,000 excess deaths, that will be a good scenario

Calculates that the current toll is nearing 450,000

In Covid, you choose between the economy and people's lives - mostly older people's lives

The Russian state chose the economy. They won't say it, but it's obvious

You can't leave people without work. Obviously, the best protection would be a spacesuit, but you can’t wear that for a whole year. So we look for a reasonable balance
