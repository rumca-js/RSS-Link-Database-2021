From award-winning filmmaker Jacqueline Olive, the short film documents how staff at these funeral homes have reimagined traditional cultural grieving practices for the COVID-19 era, aiming to bring comfort to a hard-hit city — while trying to keep from falling ill themselves.

“It's been a very stressful time,” says embalmer Stephanie Simon in the above clip. “It was like we were playing Russian roulette with our own lives."
