weakened immune systems?\n\nhttps://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-vaccines-immunocompromised\n\nProfessor Ellie Barnes, Oxford University\n\nCauses of immunosuppression\n\nAuto-immune conditions (e.g. lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, \nCrohn\u2019s disease)\n\nGenetic conditions\n\nChronic diseases, liver, kidney disease, cancer \n\nPost organ or bone marrow transplant\n\nComplications of vaccination in immunocompromise\n\nProblems with live vaccines\n\nMeasles, mumps, rubella\nSmallpox\nYellow fever\n\nReduced immune response may lower vaccine efficacy\n\n\nAre the COVID vaccines safe for people who are immunocompromised?\n\nCurrently in UK, Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine\n\nNeither of these are live vaccines. \n\nAnd because of that, there's no theoretical reason why these vaccines would not be completely safe, even \nfor people who are severely immunocompromised\n\nPfizer mRNA vaccine\n\nNo virus involved with that at all\n\nOxford/AstraZeneca vaccine\n\nViral vector carries RNA to cells\n\nCannot replicate in cells or cause disease\n\nThese vaccines have been shown to be very safe\n\nThere's no reason why an immunocompromised person would have a different adverse effect profile, compared to a healthy person after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine\n\nAllergies\n\nExtremely rare\n\nNot expected to be more likely in immunocompromised people\n\nVaccine efficacy in immunocompromise\n\nThe phase three vaccines studies generally recruited healthy people and excluded people with severe disease and immunosuppressive therapy\n\nAlthough it\u2019s likely that vaccines can provide some level of protection for people who are immunocompromised, \n\nright now we don\u2019t have any solid data on how well COVID-19 vaccines will work in people with weakened immune systems\n\nOCTAVE study\n\nBritish Society for Immunology\n\nWhile COVID-19 vaccination might provide a lower level of protection in people who are immunosuppressed or immunocompromised compared with the rest of the population,\n\nit is still very important that you get vaccinated as it will offer you a certain amount of protection against catching COVID-19.\n\nIt is important that you receive two doses of the vaccine to maximise the protection that vaccination offers you.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination will work best if you have a functioning immune system. \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the COVID-19 vaccines can protect you from getting seriously ill with COVID-19, \n\nalthough if your immune system isn\u2019t functioning optimally this protection will not be complete.\u201d\n\nProfessor Ellie Barnes\n\nThe vaccines will not harm you, and they may give you some protection\n\nSo my advice to patients currently is: if you're offered a vaccine, take it\n\nWhen You\u2019ve Been Fully Vaccinated\n\nTwo weeks after second dose in a 2-dose series, like the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines\n\nTwo weeks after a single-dose vaccine, like Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Janssen vaccine\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html\n\nWhat Hasn\u2019t Changed\n\nKeep taking precautions in public places, wearing a mask, 6 feet, avoiding crowds, poorly ventilated spaces until we know more\n\nIn public\n\nGathering with unvaccinated people\n\nVisiting an unvaccinated person\n\nStill avoid medium or large-sized gatherings\n\nStill delay domestic and international travel\n\nStill watch out for symptoms\n\nStill get tested if symptomatic\n\nStill self isolate\n\nStill need to follow guidance at your workplace.\n\nWhat\u2019s Changed\n\nGather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask\n\nGather indoors with unvaccinated people from one other household, unless any of those has an increased risk of severe illness\n\nIf you\u2019ve been around someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms.\n\nHowever, if you live in a group setting, and are around someone who has COVID-19, you should still stay away from others for 14 days and get tested, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms\n\nWhat We Know and What We\u2019re Still Learning\n\nWe know COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing COVID-19 disease, especially severe illness and death.\n\nWe\u2019re still learning how effective the vaccines are against variants \n\nWe know that prevention measures help stop the spread of COVID-19, and that these steps are still important\n\nWe\u2019re still learning how well vaccines prevent spread\n\nWe\u2019re still learning how long vaccines can protect people.\n\nEstonia\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-56330945\n\nNew lockdown from Thursday, education and shops\n\nUK
