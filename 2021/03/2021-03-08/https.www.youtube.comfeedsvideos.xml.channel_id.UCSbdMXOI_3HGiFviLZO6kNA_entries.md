Hello and WELCOME TO! TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news. This week we have some Quest 2 news (like always it seems) but we also have some odd information on the Quest 3 and 4 and what we can expect from those devices from Mark Zuckerberg himself. More pressing this week is HTC and their announcement of 2, possibly 3 new devices including a new standalone headset this year. The thumbnail is showing a "proton" prototype and is not confirmed to be the new headset, but it is the most recent prototype we have seen. Also a new VRMMORPG and some cheap full body tracking coming soon, that and so much more, I hope you enjoy!
