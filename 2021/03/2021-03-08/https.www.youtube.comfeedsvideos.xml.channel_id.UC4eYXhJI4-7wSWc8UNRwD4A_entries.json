Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | March 9, 2021\n\"I'm Robin Pecknold from Fleet Foxes. Thank you so much for asking me to find the tiniest desk I could, and sing unadorned for the first time in too long.\"\n\nWith his guitar and that unadorned voice, Robin Pecknold performs four songs from Fleet Foxes' 2020 album, Shore. It's an album that pays homage to some of the greats that we've lost \u2014 some more recently, including David Berman and Richard Swift, and some long gone but still influential, like Elliott Smith, Curtis Mayfield, Jimi Hendrix and Judee Sill. Robin wrote the songs while driving in the Catskills and (as you hear on \"Going-to-the-Sun Road\") Montana, a place that feels like home.\n\nIt's been a dozen years since Robin Pecknold's first, self-titled Fleet Foxes album, a record filled with harmony that brightened the somewhat dark lyrics. Here, alone, his message comes through even more apparent, and the songs written both before and during the pandemic shine light on darkness. \n\nSET LIST\n\"Going-to-the-Sun-Road\"\n\"Sunblind\"\n\"Featherweight\"\n\"I'm Not My Season\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nRobin Pecknold: guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Fortress Entertainment, Riley Burke, Tristan Seniuk, Sean Pecknold\nAudio: Jarvis Taveniere\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#fleetfoxes #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko5yZHAiKTU", "date_published": "2021-03-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
