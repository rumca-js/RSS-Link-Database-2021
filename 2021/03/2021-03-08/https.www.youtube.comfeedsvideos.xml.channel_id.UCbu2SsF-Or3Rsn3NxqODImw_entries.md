Veteran voice actor Roger Craig Smith breaks down some of his biggest roles, including Batman, Apex Legends' Mirage, and of course, Sonic The Hedgehog. 

Do you ever just watch something and recognize a voice in it and it drives you up the wall until you Google who they are, and discover they've lent their voice to some of your favorite characters? Enter: Roger Craig Smith.

A veteran of voice acting, Roger Craig Smith joins us to talk through some of his most iconic roles, and boy, does he have a lot of those under his belt. Roger has voiced dozens of well-known characters over the years, from the caped crusader Batman in 2013's Arkham Origins and Chris Redfield in Resident Evil 5, to everyone's favorite Italian assassin, Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Assassin's Creed. He's probably best known for his ten-year stint as Sonic the Hedgehog, a role he recently has moved on from. In this video, he tells behind the scenes stories about the characters he's played, and even talks about what it's like to be recognized for Say Yes To The Dress.

From Unreal Tournament, BioShock, Batman, Arkham, Final Fantasy VII Remake, to, of course, Fortnite, the Unreal Engine is the backbone of many of our favorite games. Let's take a trip down memory lane to see how far the game development technology has come.  Get a glimpse of how the Unreal Engine has evolved from its first iteration all the way to its fifth iteration. 

Throughout its history, the Unreal Engine has maintained itself as one of the most popular development tools in the games industry. From its early days in the mid 90s, to its powerhouse performance as a games and film visual creation engine, the Unreal Engine has powered many of the most iconic video games over the course of nearly three decades--which includes Gears of War, BioShock, and Fortnite.

In this video, we're taking a look at the evolution of Epic Games' tech. Starting with 1996's Unreal Engine 1 tech demo, we look at how Epic Games'  early tech revolutionized the rendering of 3D environments. Then after, we go over how Unreal Engine 2 took things further by adding improved lighting, detailed character animations, and a greater sense of depth in 3D spaces. From there, the video continues on, from Unreal Engine 3 all the way to the current day where we're now still awaiting the upcoming release of Unreal Engine 5, which adds more realistic visuals and lighting. 

Along with this look back at the advances to the Unreal Engine, we've also published an extensive video on the evolution of PlayStation consoles. For more information on what's to come with the Unreal Engine 5, be sure to check back with GameSpot for more details.
