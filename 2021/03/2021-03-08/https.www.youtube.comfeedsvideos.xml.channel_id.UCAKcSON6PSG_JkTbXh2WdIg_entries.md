Burk Uzzle has enjoyed a decades-long career as a photojournalist, where his work including photography of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and documenting the Civil Rights movement. Uzzle now lives in Wilson, N.C., where he primarily works in art photography with strong anti-racist themes.

The Woodstock photo, which captured Bobbi Kelly and Nick Ercoline — who have now been married since 1971 — as they embraced at dawn on a hillside at Max Yasgur's dairy farm, the site of the Woodstock music festival, may be Uzzle's most well-known work. But it's not the experience he cherishes the most, as he tells Mary Lucia in the interview above.
