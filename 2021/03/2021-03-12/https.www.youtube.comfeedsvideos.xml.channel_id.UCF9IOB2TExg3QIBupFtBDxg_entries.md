Risk of mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1: matched cohort study

https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579

54 906 matched pairs of participants

Tested positive, between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021

Followed-up until 12 February 2021

Death within 28 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. 

Mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with old variant, 1.64

Represents an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 per 1000 detected cases

Phase 3, 15,000 (UK) 30,000 (US and Mexico)

Reporting in April

Efficacy, B.1.1.7, 86%, against mild, moderate and severe disease

100% percent effective against severe disease, including against the variants

All severe cases were in the placebo groups in UK and SA

Our take on this is this is a very good result. It is important to prevent severe disease; it would be ideal to prevent all disease

No evidence of an increase in blood clots with AZ

I regret that ... some countries in the European Union have suspended vaccination with AstraZeneca

From what we know so far, the benefit ... is far greater than the risk

Blood clots, no higher than that seen in the general population

It is not yet clear whether there is a causal association between vaccination and the reports of immune thrombocytopenia
