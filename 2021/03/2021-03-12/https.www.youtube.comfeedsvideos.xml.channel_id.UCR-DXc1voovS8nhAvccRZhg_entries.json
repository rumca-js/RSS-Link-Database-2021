Native M.2 NVMe on a Raspberry Pi - CM4 TOFU", "description": "The TOFU by Oratek is the first board I've had in hand that has a built-in M.2 slot so I can finally use a native NVMe SSD directly on the Pi, something I've been hoping to do for years!\n\nBut it has a few other tricks up its sleeve. Oratek is a Swiss company, and just like the Swiss Army Knife from the same country, it packs a lot of functionality into a 9cm^2 board!\n\nProducts mentioned in this video (some are affiliate links):\n\n  - TOFU by Oratek: https://tofu.oratek.com\n  - KingSpec 128GB M.2 2242 SSD: https://amzn.to/3bAMv63\n  - WD SN520 2230 SSD: https://amzn.to/3cijET7\n  - Argon One M.2: https://amzn.to/3vgC674\n  - Ender 3 V2 3D Printer: https://amzn.to/2OLigQA\n\nOther resources mentioned in this video:\n\n  - Raspberry Pi PCIe Database: https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com\n  - CM4 Boards: https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/boards_cm\n  - TOFU Case on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4786257\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\n\n#RaspberryPi #TOFU #M2\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - M.2 on a Raspberry Pi!\n00:30 - Oratek's TOFU\n01:13 - M.2 2242 B-key\n01:49 - NVMe Benchmarks\n03:17 - 4G LTE Modems\n03:50 - Power features\n04:41 - Board IO\n05:41 - My first 3D case design!\n06:56 - TOFU conclusions\n07:34 - Thanks and bloopers", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-QSQ24_8LY", "date_published": "2021-03-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
