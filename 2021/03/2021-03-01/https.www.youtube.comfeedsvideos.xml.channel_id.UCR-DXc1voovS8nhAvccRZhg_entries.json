They do have a newer version available, but it does not yet support 'tri-mode'. Only a few servers currently support all three of the SATA/SAS/NVMe protocols via one connector (assuming you use an adequate HBA like the MegaRAID I used in my last video).\n\nSee the previous video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zpfq8ZC2hyI\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\n\n#PSU #SAS\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - PS_ON to GND\n02:26 - How it's supposed to work\n04:05 - SFF-TA-1005 Tri-mode Backplane", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncMyfV2XPTY", "date_published": "2021-03-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
