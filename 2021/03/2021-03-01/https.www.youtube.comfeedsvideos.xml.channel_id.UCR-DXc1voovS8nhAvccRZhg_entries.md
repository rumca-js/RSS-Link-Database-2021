After the last video, I figured I should clarify what I was trying to do with my PSU that led to me almost getting electrocuted.

Also, a lot of people were asking about the hard drive backplane I used, so I gave a few more details about the SFF-TA-1005 'Universal Backplane' reference that Broadcom sent me.

It's not commercially available, though the actual hardware unit was built from a SerialCables.com unit that is no longer available. They do have a newer version available, but it does not yet support 'tri-mode'. Only a few servers currently support all three of the SATA/SAS/NVMe protocols via one connector (assuming you use an adequate HBA like the MegaRAID I used in my last video).
