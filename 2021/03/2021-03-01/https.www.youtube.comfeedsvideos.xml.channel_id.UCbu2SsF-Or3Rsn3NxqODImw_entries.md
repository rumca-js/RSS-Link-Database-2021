For over 14 years we’ve seen the MP5 featured in almost every Call of Duty game. Here’s a look at how the reliable submachine gun has evolved over the course of 14 titles.

The MP5 is one of Call of Duty’s most well-known submachine guns. It’s been featured in more than a dozen games and modes and has seen quite a few changes. In this video, we check out it’s evolution within the entire series. Everything from its introduction in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, to its futuristic stylings of Infinite Warfare and beyond.

The reliable MP5 is a fan favorite. It usually delivers a fast fire rate with low recoil. In most Call of Duty games, it’s the strongest submachine gun in terms of damage. Unfortunately, the same can’t always can’t always be said when it comes to Treyarch’s Zombies modes. Submachine guns and zombies don’t mix very well and can leave you wanting a stronger weapon in later rounds. 

Even every iteration, there are a few staples that make up that classic MP5 look. This includes its iron sights and familiar body shape. In futuristic titles like Infinite Warfare, the MP5 goes by other names like the VPR, but after getting your hands on them, the feel and performance of this submachine gun stands out and feels familiar. While the look and style has changed over the years, there’s no denying it’s smooth handling and solid time to kill. It’s a gun we COD fans can’t live without.

Two roommates (Lucy James and Kinda Funny's Greg Miller) play Hazelight Studio's latest It Takes Two, and give their impressions on the couch co-op caper.

It Takes Two is an upcoming co-op game from Josef Fares and his team at Hazelight Studios that follows a couple as they navigate the murky waters of their divorce. Unfortunately for Cody and May, it's not going to be a clean break. Thanks to a magical spell accidentally cast by their daughter, Rose, they are turned into doll versions of themselves and must explore their own house, but from a very unique point of view. 

In the above video, real-life roommates Lucy James and Kinda Funny's Greg Miller discuss how the game feels to play, how funny it is, as well as how it manages to marry (pun not intended) gameplay and story to build a truly creative cooperative experience. 

Check out Kinda Funny's First Impressions at youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames, or follow Greg on Twitter @gameovergreggy. For more on It Takes Two, we've got the first 20 minutes of gameplay up on https://youtube.com/GameSpotTrailers, as well as a chat with the game's director, Josef Fares on gamespot.com. It Takes Two launches on March 26 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Breath of the Wild's complex mechanics and overlapping intricacies led players to push the game's boundaries, resulting in several gameplay clips that took the internet by storm. Some of these are so complex, it's hard for the average player to decipher exactly what's even happening. 

In the above video, Max, our in-house BOTW expert, reacts to some of the most viral BOTW clips, and breaks down techniques like Shield Skew Clipping, Bow Spinning (which he coined), Stasis Launching, and more.
