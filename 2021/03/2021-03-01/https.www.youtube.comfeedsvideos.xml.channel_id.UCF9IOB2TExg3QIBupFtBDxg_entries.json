vector vaccine on symptomatic disease, hospitalisations and mortality in older adults in the UK: a test negative case control study\n \nhttps://khub.net/documents/135939561/430986542/Early+effectiveness+of+COVID+vaccines.pdf/ffd7161c-b255-8e88-c2dc-88979fc2cc1b?t=1614617945615\n\nObjectives\n\nReal-world effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine and \u2026\n\nAstrazeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine against\u2026.\n\nConfirmed COVID-19, hospitalisations and deaths\n\nTo estimate effectiveness on the UK variant of concern. \n\nSetting \n\nCommunity COVID-19 PCR testing in England \n\n8th December 2020 and 19th February 2021\n\nAll adults in England aged 70 years and older (over 7.5 million)\n\nAll symptomatic COVID-19 testing in the community in over 70s\n\nTest negative case control design \n\n174,731 PCR tests\n\n156,930 of these (89.8%) linked to vaccination data\n\n44,590 (28.4%) were positive tests\n\n112,340 (71.6%) were negative\n\nInterventions \n\nOne and two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine\n\nOne dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine\n\nMain outcome measures \n\nSymptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nHospitalisations and deaths with COVID-19. \n\nSymptomatic disease infection risk Results \n\nIndividuals aged more than 80 years vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2\n\nHigher odds of testing positive in the first 9 days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48)\n\nVaccine effects were noted from 10-13 days after vaccination\n\nReaching an effectiveness of 70% from 28-34 days, then plateauing\n\nFrom 14 days after the second dose, vaccine effectiveness was 89%\n\n(Fewer than 10 over 80 sent to ITU every day in UK)\n\nIndividuals aged more than70 years\n\nPfizer BNT162b2\n\nVaccine effectiveness reached 61% from 28-34 days then plateaued \n\nAZ ChAdOx1\n\nVaccine effects, were seen from 14-20 days\n\nReaching an effectiveness of 60% from 28-34 days\n\nFurther increasing to 73% from day 35 onwards\n\nRisk of emergency hospitalisation and death results\n\nOne dose of BNT162b2\n\nAdditional 43% lower risk of emergency hospitalisation\n\nAdditional 51% lower risk of death\n\nOne dose of ChAdOx1\n\nAdditional 37% lower risk of emergency hospitalisation\n\nInsufficient follow-up to assess the effect of ChAdOx1 on mortality\n\nCombined with the effect against symptomatic disease\n\nSingle dose of either vaccine is approximately 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation\n\nSingle dose of BNT162b2 is 85% effective at preventing death\n\nSingle dose of ChAdOx1 unknown protective effect against death\n\nConclusion \n\nSignificant reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV2 positive cases in older adults\n\nEven greater protection against severe disease\n\nBoth vaccines show similar effects\n\nProtection was maintained for more than 6 weeks\n\nA second dose of BNT162b2 provides further protection against symptomatic disease\n\nSecond doses of ChAdOx1 have not yet been rolled out in England\n\nThere is a clear effect of the vaccines against the UK variant of concern\n\nProfessor Jonathan Van-Tam\n\nJoint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation\n\nnot immunologically plausible the vaccine would work in younger age groups and not older ones.\n\nDr Mary Ramsay, PHE's head of immunisation, said it could.\n\nIf anything we would expect it to be a stronger protection from the vaccine\n\nLower down in the age range is that people's chances of being hospitalised and dying are much lower\n\nFrance \n\nOxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, can be given to people with underlying health conditions in the 65-74 age group\n\n1.1m doses in country\n\nGermany\n\nStill not giving the AstraZeneca to the over-65s\n\nNow under discussion\n\nLarge stocks of that vaccine waiting to be used\n\n(Belgium, Poland, Italy, Sweden)\n\nProfessor Andrew Pollard, Oxford Vaccine group\n\nFindings were stunning\n\n5,000 people dying every day in Europe, important to increase confidence in vaccines\n\ndisappointing in some senses\n\nreally high levels of protection\n\nsupport their decision making\n\nOxford vaccine distributed to low-income countries,
