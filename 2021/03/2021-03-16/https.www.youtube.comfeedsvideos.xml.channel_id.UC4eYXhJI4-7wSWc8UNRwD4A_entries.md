The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Stephen Thompson | March 17, 2021
If you were to apply one of those "how it started / how it's going" memes to Tiny Desk (home) concerts — which began, it turns out, almost exactly one year ago — you'd have, under "how it's going," the image of pop superstar Justin Bieber as he and his band perform the world premiere of a new song called "Peaches."

"Peaches" will exist in a significantly different form when Bieber drops his new album Justice on Friday — the track will feature guest vocals from GIVEŌN and Daniel Caesar — just as "Holy," another song from Justice, opens this set without the presence of guest Chance the Rapper. But Bieber's Tiny Desk set, performed with the aid of We the Band, provides the fullest taste yet (fully 25 percent!) of the singer's sixth album, whose singles have already been streamed hundreds of millions of times.

Bieber has had a massive month as he prepares for Justice to drop: March 2021 began with the singer's 27th birthday and recently produced his second career Grammy, as he took the prize for best country duo or group performance for "10,000 Hours" with Dan + Shay. It continues with this, his Tiny Desk debut. Friday, the next chapter officially begins.

## The Racist Roots Of Rap On Trial | Louder Than A Riot | NPR Music

Mac the Camouflage Assassin. Boosie Badazz. Drakeo the Ruler. Mayhem Mal. Since the 1990s, police and prosecutors have used lyrics to build and try criminal cases against rap artists. It’s weak evidence and lazy prosecution that blurs the distinction between entertainment and criminal confession. And it’s only happening in hip-hop.

From the U.S. government’s policing of jazz and blues to rap lyrics on trial, NPR Music’s Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden trace Black music’s criminalized history and lay out the racist implications behind prosecuting hip-hop. 

WHAT'S LOUDER THAN A RIOT?
Rhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. Louder Than A Riot reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles — the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.
