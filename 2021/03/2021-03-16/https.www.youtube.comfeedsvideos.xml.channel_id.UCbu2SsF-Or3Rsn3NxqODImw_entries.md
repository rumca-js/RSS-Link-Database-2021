While there have been mods over the years to simulate first person in Breath of the Wild, a recent discovery finally allows anyone to glitch the game to play it in first person for the most cinematic and immersive experience.

Breath of the Wild, to this day, continues to have groundbreaking discoveries even 4 years after release. The most recent breakthrough lets players engage a first person mode at any time which gave us some heavy Skyrim vibes.

It is difficult to perform though, and we break it down with our hands on camera so you can see the difficult portions being done. This requires a multitude of glitches, including Menu Overloading, Item Hold Smuggling, and Model Teleporting to perform, but if done correctly, is well worth it for a more immersive and cinematic Breath of the Wild experience than ever before on Nintendo Switch.

Is Sonic real, can Sonic fly, and is Sonic his real name? All that and more answered by the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog, Roger Craig Smith.

Roger Craig Smith was the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog from 2010 to 2021. He lent his vocal talents to Sonic Colors, Sonic Generations, Sonic Boom, and Sonic Forces among many other titles. 

In this video, we decided to take to the internet to figure out what the people want to know most about him and Sonic. Watch as we ask Roger the most searched questions about the blue blur to see what he had to say, and find out how well he knows the character himself. 

But you've probably also heard his voice in more than just Sonic games. Roger Craig Smith is prolific and is also the voice of a bunch of other iconic video game characters including Ezio Auditore da Firenze from the Assassin’s Creed series, Batman in Batman: Arkham Origins, and Mirage in Apex Legends. These performances are iconic in their own right, and if you want to see Roger break down those roles you can check out the other video we did with him here: https://youtu.be/svDDP6nx5jg
