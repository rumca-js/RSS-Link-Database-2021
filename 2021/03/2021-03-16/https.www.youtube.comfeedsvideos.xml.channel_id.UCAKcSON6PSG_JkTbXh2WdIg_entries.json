Cold War Kids enjoyed great success in 2015 with their song \"First\"; the song peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and became the band's highest charting single. But being on top also presented its own challenges. \"The scariest thing in the world to me is the idea of having a song do great, riding that wave to the end, and then starting a new record with all of the feelings and expectations that come with that,\" said Cold War Kids' Nate Willett.\n\nBut it was in that context that Cold War Kids, working with producer Lars Stalfors, recorded their next album, \"L.A. Divine,\" which released on April 7, 2017. A few weeks before that release date, Cold War Kids played a sold-out show at First Avenue in Minneapolis and they visited The Current for a stripped-down set. Watch two performances from that studio session.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Love Is Mystical\"\n3:45 \"First\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nNathan Willett \u2013 guitar, vocals\nMatthew Schwartz \u2013 keys, vocals\nMatt Maust \u2013 bass\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Emmet Kowler; Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Elijah Deaton-Berg\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2009 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2009/04/15/cold_war_kids\n2011 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/03/10/cold-war-kids-live\n2013 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/10/02/cold-war-kids-live\n2017 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/03/15/cold-war-kids-preview-la-divine-stripped-down-set-in-the-current-studio\n2020 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/01/24/cold-war-kids-play-a-strippeddown-set-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#coldwarkids", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx1PxZr9go4", "date_published": "2021-03-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Listen to Looch: an intense documentary about Dave Navarro", "description": "Mary Lucia talks about the documentary \"Mourning Son,\" about Dave Navarro, guitar player for Jane's Addiction. \"I've always been a bit intrigued by his darkness, to a point,\" Lucia says. \"There's a reason for it.

And back in October 2017, we were lucky enough to welcome the Melbourne-based musician into our studio.\n\nIn The Current's studio, Sultana orchestrated a carefully choreographed performance of their songs \"Jungle\" and \"Notion,\" using numerous loops to lay down guitar tracks \u2014 starting with the basic chord progression, then moving to ornamentation, followed by a bassline. At that point, Sultana shifted to percussion, and when all the pieces were in place, started singing to the layers of music they create. Sultana also adds some rocking guitar parts to each song, showcasing a playing style that invites comparisons to Prince.\n\nWatch Tash Sultana's spellbinding performances above. \n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Jungle\"\n8:09 \"Notion\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nTash Sultana \u2013 everything\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Helen Teague\nAudio: Corey Schreppel\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/10/25/tash-sultana-rocks-out-in-the-current-studio\n2021 virtual session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2021/03/04/tash-sultana-virtual-session\n2021 Album of the Week (March 15), \"Terra Firma\"\nhttp://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2021/03/15/album-of-the-week-tash-sultana-terra-firma\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#tashsultana", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPzEGsNOz_A", "date_published": "2021-03-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
