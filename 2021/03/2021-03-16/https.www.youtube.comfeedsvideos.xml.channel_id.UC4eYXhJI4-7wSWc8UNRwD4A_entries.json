Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nStephen Thompson | March 17, 2021\nIf you were to apply one of those \"how it started / how it's going\" memes to Tiny Desk (home) concerts \u2014 which began, it turns out, almost exactly one year ago \u2014 you'd have, under \"how it's going,\" the image of pop superstar Justin Bieber as he and his band perform the world premiere of a new song called \"Peaches.\"\n\n\"Peaches\" will exist in a significantly different form when Bieber drops his new album Justice on Friday \u2014 the track will feature guest vocals from GIVE\u014cN and Daniel Caesar \u2014 just as \"Holy,\" another song from Justice, opens this set without the presence of guest Chance the Rapper. But Bieber's Tiny Desk set, performed with the aid of We the Band, provides the fullest taste yet (fully 25 percent!) of the singer's sixth album, whose singles have already been streamed hundreds of millions of times.\n\nBieber has had a massive month as he prepares for Justice to drop: March 2021 began with the singer's 27th birthday and recently produced his second career Grammy, as he took the prize for best country duo or group performance for \"10,000 Hours\" with Dan + Shay. It continues with this, his Tiny Desk debut. Friday, the next chapter officially begins.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Holy\"\n\"Peaches\"\n\"Hold On\"\n\"Anyone\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJustin Bieber: vocals, keys\nHarv: bass\nO'Neil \"Doctor O\" Palmer: keys\nDJ Tay James: DJ\nRobert Taylor: drums\nJulian McGuire: guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Nick Demoura, Mike Drew, Rory Kramer, Aaron Kroger, James Coker\nAudio: Jim Ebdon, Dylan Ely, James Roach, Chris Houghton, Taylor Meyer\nProduction Manager: Chris Gratton\nCamera Operators: Austin Wavra, Daniel Mardoyan, Noel Galan\nLighting Tech: Jim Mecsery\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producers: Maia Stern, Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#justinbieber #tinydesk #nprmusic #pop #rnb", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su6kidaGW_8", "date_published": "2021-03-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "The Racist Roots Of Rap On Trial | Louder Than A Riot | NPR Music", "description": "Mac the Camouflage Assassin. Boosie Badazz. Drakeo the Ruler. Mayhem Mal. Since the 1990s, police and prosecutors have used lyrics to build and try criminal cases against rap artists. It\u2019s weak evidence and lazy prosecution that blurs the distinction between entertainment and criminal confession. And it\u2019s only happening in hip-hop.\n\nFrom the U.S. government\u2019s policing of jazz and blues to rap lyrics on trial, NPR Music\u2019s Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden trace Black music\u2019s criminalized history and lay out the racist implications behind prosecuting hip-hop. \n\nWHAT'S LOUDER THAN A RIOT?\nRhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. Louder Than A Riot reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles \u2014 the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.\n\nLISTEN to more episodes of Louder Than A Riot on: \nNPR One - https://rpb3r.app.goo.gl/louderthanariot\nApple Podcasts - https://apple.co/3ecRD1P\nSpotify - https://spoti.fi/3kVVAt5\n\nFOLLOW Louder Than A Riot:\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/LouderThanARiot\u200b\n\nFOLLOW Louder Than A Riot hosts:\nRodney Carmichael - https://twitter.com/rodneyology\u200b\nSidney Madden - https://twitter.com/Sid_Madden\n\n#louderthanariot #hiphop #massincarceration #lyricsontrial", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSONFPl4Qvc", "date_published": "2021-03-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
