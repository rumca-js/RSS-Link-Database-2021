## Cold War Kids - two songs in The Current studio (2017)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx1PxZr9go4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx1PxZr9go4)

Four years ago this week, Cold War Kids visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Mary Lucia. Cold War Kids enjoyed great success in 2015 with their song "First"; the song peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and became the band's highest charting single. But being on top also presented its own challenges. "The scariest thing in the world to me is the idea of having a song do great, riding that wave to the end, and then starting a new record with all of the feelings and expectations that come with that," said Cold War Kids' Nate Willett.

But it was in that context that Cold War Kids, working with producer Lars Stalfors, recorded their next album, "L.A. Divine," which released on April 7, 2017. A few weeks before that release date, Cold War Kids played a sold-out show at First Avenue in Minneapolis and they visited The Current for a stripped-down set. Watch two performances from that studio session.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Love Is Mystical"
3:45 "First"

PERSONNEL
Nathan Willett – guitar, vocals
Matthew Schwartz – keys, vocals

## Listen to Looch: an intense documentary about Dave Navarro
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXDHw-eQT84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXDHw-eQT84)

Mary Lucia talks about the documentary "Mourning Son," about Dave Navarro, guitar player for Jane's Addiction. "I've always been a bit intrigued by his darkness, to a point," Lucia says. "There's a reason for it. This documentary goes through the trauma that Navarro experienced at the age of 15, when his mother and his aunt were both murdered, and the following nine years when the killer was on the lam."

Directed by Navarro's friend, filmmaker Todd Newman, "Mourning Son" is available for streaming on Amazon Prime.

## Tash Sultana - two performances at The Current (2017)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPzEGsNOz_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPzEGsNOz_A)

Tash Sultana's new album, "Terra Firma," is our Album of the Week. And back in October 2017, we were lucky enough to welcome the Melbourne-based musician into our studio.

In The Current's studio, Sultana orchestrated a carefully choreographed performance of their songs "Jungle" and "Notion," using numerous loops to lay down guitar tracks — starting with the basic chord progression, then moving to ornamentation, followed by a bassline. At that point, Sultana shifted to percussion, and when all the pieces were in place, started singing to the layers of music they create. Sultana also adds some rocking guitar parts to each song, showcasing a playing style that invites comparisons to Prince.

Watch Tash Sultana's spellbinding performances above. 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Jungle"
8:09 "Notion"
