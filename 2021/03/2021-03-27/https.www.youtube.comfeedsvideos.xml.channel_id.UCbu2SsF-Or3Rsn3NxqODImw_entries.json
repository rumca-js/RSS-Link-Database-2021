Pandemic? Politics? Bitcoin? Bots?!\n\nWhen the heck will we be able to get our graphics cards?\n\nFor a list of vendors to check or keep an eye on, check out this article: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-rtx-3090-3080-3070-buyers-guide-be-notified-when-theyre-in-stock/1100-6481694/\n\nGamers everywhere are chasing the hardware needed to run the best of their games, but graphics cards shortages have been around for nearly a year now. So why are GPUs so rare and expensive right now?\n\nUnfortunately there is more than one issue at play in the great hardware shortage of the 2020s. Covid-19 has meant that production and logistics have been slowed and the raw materials that go into chips and boards are much harder to come by, which has meant fewer GPUs for gamers trying to chase triple digits framerates in their FPS.\n\nThe Bitcoin miners and scalpers have also been a leading factor in the graphics card shortage, as many were using online bots to instantly purchase as many AMD or Nvidia GPUs as soon as stock was available.\n\nIt looks like the issues aren\u2019t going away any time soon though, with the global chip shortage currently reaching crisis point.\u00a0\n\nMake sure to keep your eye on GameSpot for any news about the GPU shortage or upcoming availability.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJR2OVYampk", "date_published": "2021-03-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
