Population, 213 million

Deaths, + 3,000 (per day)

Andréia Cruz, emergency-ward nurse, Porto Alegre

We’re in the trenches here, fighting a war

P.1 strain, now in 20 countries

Manaus variant

Industrial hub, truck route

Most prevalent variant in Brazil

New York, found last week

Up to 2.2 times more contagious

Up to 61% more able to reinfect people

? increased mortality

Porto Alegre

P.1 at least 60%

Hospitals overwhelmed

Doctors report younger patients

Doctors report fitter patients getting sick

Deaths in Brazil (WSJ analysis)

Under 60 previous peak, 26% of deaths

Under 60s, this peak, 30% of deaths 

Diego Montarroyos Simões, intensive-care doctor, Recife

We’re seeing patients who aren’t obese, who have no comorbidities, who are not old but, even so, the virus just overwhelms them

Problems

US, widespread complacency

Fully vaccinated in Brazil, 1.9%

? further P.1 mutations

William Hanage, Harvard University epidemiologist

There is a rush to declare this pandemic is over, and it’s not

I dread to think what will happen when P.1 manages to get to places that are not likely to get vaccinated for quite some time

Most daily cases per capita ever 

Uruguay, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia

Felipe Naveca, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation

https://portal.fiocruz.br/en

If we don’t stop the virus circulating, it won’t stop evolving

Peru

40% of infections are P.1

Current vaccines, efficacy against P.1?

Preliminary studies

Yes, but possible/probably reduced efficacy

Novel oral antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 progresses in Phase I trial, Protease inhibitor

https://www.europeanpharmaceuticalreview.com/news/148536/novel-oral-antiviral-for-sars-cov-2-progresses-in-phase-i-trial/

Background science

Viral proteases are enzymes, endopeptidases

Encoded by the genetic material (DNA or RNA) of viral pathogens

Catalyze cleavage of specific peptide bonds in viral precursors

These proteolytic events are essential for the completion of the viral infectious cycle

Protease inhibitors, bind to a viral enzyme, called a protease

Prevent the virus from replicating

Protease inhibitors, used to treat HIV and hepatitis C

Assess tolerability and safety of multiple ascending doses of PF-07321332

Phase I study, healthy adults 

Randomised, double-blind, sponsor-open, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose escalation study in healthy adults evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PF-07321332.

Protease inhibitor, demonstrated potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. 

Could be prescribed orally at the first sign of infection

Pfizer also investigating an intravenously administered protease inhibitor, PF-07304814, in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

Viral evolution

adenine, cytosine, uracil, guanine

Darwinian evolution

Species undergo random mutation

Making most less fit

But making a few more fit

Fit means compete, survive, reproduce

Natural selection will ‘select’ the more fit

Viruses usually become less virulent over time

Increased virulence / transmissibility

Mutations that increase transmissibility

Mutations that can avoid antibodies

Mutations that can avoid vaccination defences
