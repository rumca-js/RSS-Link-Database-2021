Covering the lands of The Silmarillion, region by region. We break down the entire map of Beleriand - the primary location of the events of the First Age of Middle-earth. Along the way, we will note important realms, events, and strongholds from The Silmarillion, The Children of Húrin, Beren and Lúthien, and The Fall of Gondolin.
