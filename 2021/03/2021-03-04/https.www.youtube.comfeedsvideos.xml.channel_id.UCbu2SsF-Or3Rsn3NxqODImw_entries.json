Here are 10 things we'd love to see!\n\nWe still know very little about Elden Ring, From Software's upcoming open-world game. But we have a lot of Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice fans among us, so there are plenty of things we hope to see in Elden Ring.\n\nIn the video above, we detail 10 mechanics, features, and characters we hope to see in Elden Ring. We have no context for these dreams of ours beyond that Elden Ring is going to be an open-world game where different kingdoms are each ruled by a powerful entity, and that it features lore created in collaboration with Game Of Thrones author George R.R. Martin.\n\nElden Ring has most recently made the news after a gameplay trailer for the game leaked online. Don't worry, we won't be showing off the leaks in the video nor using it as the basis for any of our hopes and dreams. Frankly, leaks suck, and the trailer in question appears to be of an old build, so it's entirely possible that referencing it would be misleading.\n\nElden Ring doesn't yet have a release date, so we're unsure if we'll even get to see the game by the end of 2021.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9901tyIy5Es", "date_published": "2021-03-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Elden Ring Leaks Suck For Everyone | Console Crew", "description": "This week on Console Crew, the gang discuss why game leaks suck for everyone, what they\u2019d like to see from a Switch Pro, and what the future of PlayStation handhelds could look like.\n\nThis week on Console Crew the gang finally get to talk about Elden Ring, because goodness knows they\u2019ve never talked about a From Software game before on the show. We\u2019re not going to show any footage of the leaked Elden Ring trailer, but we do discuss it--specifically, we talk about why video game leaks suck for everyone involved.\n\nWith numerous reports that the Switch Pro is on the way, they also talk about what improvements they\u2019d like to see to the Nintendo Switch, including better performance and battery life.
