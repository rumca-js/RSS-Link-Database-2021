Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | March 4, 2021\nUsing an Edison \"Fireside\" cylinder phonograph and his own Stratus music software, \u00d3lafur Arnalds' Tiny Desk (home) concert brings the past and the future into a heartfelt performance. Filmed in his tree-lined studio in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland (the former studio of Sigur R\u00f3s), \u00d3lafur and his string quartet perform three songs from my personal No. 1 album of 2020, some kind of peace. The pensive set opens with an older tune, \"Happiness Does Not Wait,\" with \u00d3lafur Arnalds seated at a short upright piano known as a Danish 'pianette.'\n\nThe delicate performance is the perfect window into this Icelandic composer's profound and passionate music. The Edison wax cylinder that we hear on \"Woven Song\" is a traditional Amazonian healing song sung by the late shaman Herlinda Agustin Fernandez.\nLook closely at the piano toward the back of the studio during the tune \"Spiral,\" and you'll see a piano playing seemingly without a performer. That piano is reacting to \u00d3lafur Arnald's real-time performance using algorithms he and his coder friend, Halld\u00f3r Eldj\u00e1rn, developed. He used it extensively when he came and performed his Tiny Desk concert at NPR in 2018. \u00d3lafur Arnalds is a gentle subversive of 21st century music, and I'm so grateful to be able to present his enchanting sounds.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Happiness Does Not Wait\"\n\"Woven Song\"\n\"Spiral\"\n\"We Contain Multitudes\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\u00d3lafur Arnalds: piano\nGeir\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0ur \u00c1sa Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir: violin\nSigr\u00fan Har\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir: violin\nKarl James Pestka: violin\nUnnur J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir: cello\n\nCREDITS\nAudio: \u00d3lafur Arnalds, Hafsteinn \u00der\u00e1insson\nVideo: Blair Alexander\nLocal Production: \u00c1rni \u00de\u00f3r \u00c1rnason\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#olafurarnalds #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB2p5Oaa5Js", "date_published": "2021-03-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
