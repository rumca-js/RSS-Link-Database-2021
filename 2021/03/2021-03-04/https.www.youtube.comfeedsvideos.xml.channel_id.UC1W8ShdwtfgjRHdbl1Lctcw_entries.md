I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of New York 1920s, the jazz, commerce, and culture flourished. The city boasted nearly six million residents and served as a booming center for immigrants and migrants entering the through road, rail, and boats. 

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
