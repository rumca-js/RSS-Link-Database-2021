We know next to nothing about Elden Ring, but that won’t stop us from listing off some things we’d love to see in From Software’s next outing. Here are 10 things we'd love to see!

We still know very little about Elden Ring, From Software's upcoming open-world game. But we have a lot of Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice fans among us, so there are plenty of things we hope to see in Elden Ring.

In the video above, we detail 10 mechanics, features, and characters we hope to see in Elden Ring. We have no context for these dreams of ours beyond that Elden Ring is going to be an open-world game where different kingdoms are each ruled by a powerful entity, and that it features lore created in collaboration with Game Of Thrones author George R.R. Martin.

Elden Ring has most recently made the news after a gameplay trailer for the game leaked online. Don't worry, we won't be showing off the leaks in the video nor using it as the basis for any of our hopes and dreams. Frankly, leaks suck, and the trailer in question appears to be of an old build, so it's entirely possible that referencing it would be misleading.

Elden Ring doesn't yet have a release date, so we're unsure if we'll even get to see the game by the end of 2021.

This week on Console Crew, the gang discuss why game leaks suck for everyone, what they’d like to see from a Switch Pro, and what the future of PlayStation handhelds could look like.

This week on Console Crew the gang finally get to talk about Elden Ring, because goodness knows they’ve never talked about a From Software game before on the show. We’re not going to show any footage of the leaked Elden Ring trailer, but we do discuss it--specifically, we talk about why video game leaks suck for everyone involved.

With numerous reports that the Switch Pro is on the way, they also talk about what improvements they’d like to see to the Nintendo Switch, including better performance and battery life. Finally, the PlayStation Vita is getting a new physical game for the first time since 2019, which begs the question: What does the future look like for Sony handhelds? 

Console Crew is your weekly roundup of the biggest PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox news, hosted by Lucy James, Tamoor Hussain, and Jordan Ramée. Catch it every Friday at youtube.com/GameSpot.

IO Interactive level designers Toke Krainert and Victor Rasmussen break down Hitman 3's incredible Dartmoor mission, including the development of the enthralling murder mystery storyline.
