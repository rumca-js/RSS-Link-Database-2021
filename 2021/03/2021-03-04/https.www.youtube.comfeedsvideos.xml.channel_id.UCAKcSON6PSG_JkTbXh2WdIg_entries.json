Now based in Los Angeles, Sudan Archives uses a complex system of drum loops and effects to propel her music beyond classification.\n\nThroughout her set in The Current studio, she consistently cooked up a savory roux of genres: folk, ambient, hip-hop, classical, and contemporary R&B. It is the contrasting mixture of cultures that defines the sound of Sudan Archives. Watch those performances above.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Did You Know\"\n3:22 \"Nont For Sale\"\n7:10 \"Pelicans in the Summer\"\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2020 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/03/04/sudan-archives-performs-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#sudanarchives #sudanarchivesmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCh1_XIsszg", "date_published": "2021-03-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Tash Sultana - Let the Light In (live performance)", "description": "Watch Tash Sultana perform \"Let the Light In,\" a track from their new album, Terra Firma, released February 19, 2021 on Lonely Lands Records.
