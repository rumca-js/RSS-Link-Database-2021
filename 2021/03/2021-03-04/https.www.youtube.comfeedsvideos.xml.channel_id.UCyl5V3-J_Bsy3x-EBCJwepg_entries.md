Ethan is joined by Doug TenNapel in Exile and Wes Halula on this Bee Weekly to talk about Texas ditching mask mandates and what itâ€™s like to celebrate Lent while hating everybody. Ethan and Wes discuss totally substantiated Lucasfilm and Star Wars rumors involving Gina Carano, Kathleen Kennedy, and Bill Burr. Also, irony strikes at cockfights and Satanic cats try to crash passenger airplanes.
