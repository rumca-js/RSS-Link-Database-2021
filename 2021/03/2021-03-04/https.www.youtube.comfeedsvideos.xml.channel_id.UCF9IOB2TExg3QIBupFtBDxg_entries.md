It is foreseeable that B117 will soon be the predominant variant in Germany

it will be even more difficult to keep the virus in check

because B117 is more contagious and even more dangerous in all age groups

Latest on Vitamin D
https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng187/chapter/Recommendations

Basically, consider 400 units (10 mcg) per day

But, NHS mid Essex

https://midessexccg.nhs.uk/medicines-optimisation/clinical-pathways-and-medication-guidelines/chapter-9-nutrition-and-blood-2/3051-vitamin-d-deficiency-prescribing-guidance-nov-2018-replaces-separate-guidance-for-adults-children-and-in-pregnancy/file

Routine screening of vitamin D levels and prescribing of Vitamin D is not advisable. 

Both clinical symptoms and risk factors must be present before measuring Vitamin D levels (25OHD).

As yet there is no clear evidence to prove the risks from non-symptomatic Vitamin D deficiency. 

Adults

Vitamin D levels less than 30nmol/L (12ng / ml)

Oral capsules, 40,000 units (1,000 mcg or 1 mg) colecalciferol weekly for 7 weeks

(400 units per day = 2,800 units per week)

Vitamin D levels 30 – 50 nmol/L (12 – 20 ng / ml)

Buy your own, 400 units per day

Vitamin D levels more than 50 nmol/L (20 ng / ml)

Buy your own, consider, 400 units per day

Vitamin K1

Phylloquinone

Involved in blood coagulation (1929)

Found in plant foods like leafy greens

Vitamin K2

https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminK-HealthProfessional/



https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-k2#what-it-is

Menaquinones

Mostly bacterial origin

Animal-based and fermented foods

Adult vitamin K Adequate Intakes, 90 -120 mcg

Fermented foods

Sauerkraut

High fat dairy from grass fed cows

Eggs

Animal organs

Gut bacteria

Antibiotics

Prevalence of hypercalcemia related to hypervitaminosis D in clinical practice

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26995293/

Determine the concentrations of 25-OH-vitamin D at which the risk of hypercalcemia

N = 25,567

Hypervitaminosis D was defined at serum 25-OH-vitamin D more than160 nmol/L (64 ng / ml)

Results: 

382 samples were identified as the first record of hypervitaminosis D

39 presented hypercalcemia (10.2%)

Some had 25-OH-vitamin D levels between 161 and 375 nmol/L.

(most subjects presented hypercalcemia at serum concentrations of 25-OH-vitamin D less than 375 nmol/L, 150 ng / ml)

In 15 subjects, hypercalcemia could be directly attributed to vitamin D

In no case, serum calcium achieved concentrations considered as critical values (more than13 mg/dl).

Conclusion

Hypercalcemia due to vitamin D represented less than 4% of the total hypervitaminosis D detected

Less than 0.1% of the tests performed.

Healthline

No strong evidence proves that moderate amounts of vitamin D are harmful without an adequate intake of vitamin K. However, research is ongoing, and the picture might become clearer in the near future.
