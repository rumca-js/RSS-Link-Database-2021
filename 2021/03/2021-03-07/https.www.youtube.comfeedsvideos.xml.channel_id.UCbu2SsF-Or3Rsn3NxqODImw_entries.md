With rumors that a Nintendo Switch Pro is on the horizon, we round up 9 changes we'd love to see from a beefier Switch model.

Another day, another Switch Pro rumour, this time from Bloomberg, which reports that a beefed-up version of the handheld will launch in time for the 2021 holiday season. It will allegedly include a 7-inch, 720p OLED screen and be able to output in 4K when docked. 

Improving the Switch's screen is one thing, but we've got some other gripes with Nintendo that we'd love to see it address with a Switch Pro, including eliminating Joy-Con drift, adding an ethernet port to the Switch dock, and even bringing back the eShop music. Please, Nintendo, we need all the serotonin we can get.
