It will allegedly include a 7-inch, 720p OLED screen and be able to output in 4K when docked.\u00a0\n\nImproving the Switch's screen is one thing, but we've got some other gripes with Nintendo that we'd love to see it address with a Switch Pro, including eliminating Joy-Con drift, adding an ethernet port to the Switch dock, and even bringing back the eShop music. Please, Nintendo, we need all the serotonin we can get.\n\nFor more on Nintendo, make sure to tune in to Console Crew every Friday at youtube.com/GameSpot.
