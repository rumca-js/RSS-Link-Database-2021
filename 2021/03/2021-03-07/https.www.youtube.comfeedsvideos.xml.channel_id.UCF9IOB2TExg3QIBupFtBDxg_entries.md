Dr. Fauci

Those guidelines are coming out from the C.D.C. really imminently

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, C.D.C. director

these are complex issues, and the science is rapidly evolving

We are making sure and taking the time to get this right

Czech republic

In order to protect public health

To ensure the availability of medicinal products important for the provision of health care

HUVEMEC 3 mg, tablets, manufactured by Huvepharma, Bulgaria, containing the active substance Ivermectin

Subject to a medical prescription

Only for use in hospitalized patients over 18 years of age

Risk of teratogenicity

0.2 mg / kg / day administered on days 1, 3 and 5

Maximum daily dose of 24 mg was evaluated as safe and most appropriate.

Can be given to inpatient health care providers

Due to the favorable safety profile and lack of other treatment alternatives

It is more appropriate to allow the use of an unregistered medicinal product under controlled conditions

Thus prevent reckless use of Ivermectin obtained on the black market or by using inappropriate veterinary products or dosage forms (cream, paste).

The patient must be informed that he is being treated with an unregistered medicinal product

that is not used in accordance with the marketing authorization and will be aware of its benefits and risks.

Dr. Pierre Kory

Dr. Lawrie has background expertise required for analysis

We / I do not prescribe

Impressed with body of evidence from FLCCC

Several plausible mechanisms of Ivermectin action, antiviral and anti-inflammatory

Prevents viral life cycles and replication

Reduces inflammatory markers

Some studies show Ivermectin reduces viral load

Studies show possible action against yellow fever, dengue, zika and others

Let’s explore with more studies on viral illnesses

Practical empirical evidence

Preventing death and preventing infection

Including RCT and better quality observational studies = 83% reduction in deaths

Appraised each study for risk of bias

Talked to authors

Reviewed manager software

Pooled studies and data

Submitted to Matt Hancock’s office 4th Jan, no response

Publications coming

Researchers have a moral duty to relay information ASAP, so preprint site (2015)

Next, RCT only

Starting from scratch with a review team, 68% fewer deaths

Using very strict criteria

Forest plot

Plotting deaths in treatment group and deaths in placebo group

Out of 1,000 deaths
Ivermectin group, 27 deaths out of 1,000 cases
Placebo group, 82 deaths out of 903 cases

65% reduction

P = 0.002

Findings of RCT was the same as observational studies

Useful in all stages of the disease

88% reductions in infection rates

And mild and moderate disease to reduce viral load, so disease worsening

? Long covid

Possible evidence from Argentina and Peru

Placebo controlled trial for 2 weeks, with options to treat

Placebo controlled treatment trial, not ethical

Reduces symptoms, low certainty, 48%

Safety

Billions of doses have been given over 40 years

WHO, essential medicines list

Third of the world’s population, 4,600 adverse events 16 deaths

(Remdesivir, 417 deaths over past year)

Safe at 10x dose

3, 6, 12 mg tabs

0.2 mg / Kg to 0.4 mg / Kg

Oral tabs

Cost, $168 per KG

WHO, 100, 12mg tabs $2.90

BIRD, recommended for prevention and treatment in UK, and told everyone, WHO, FDA etc.

Helsinki declaration, doctors should give what they know to be effective

Large RCT would have to stop at interim analysis, probably at about 1,000 patients

Protection from infection in workers and contacts

Ivermectin group, 25 out of 1,397 got covid

Control group, 386 out of 833 got covid

Risk reduction 93% reduction in infection rates

Or 87% with the best study taken out
