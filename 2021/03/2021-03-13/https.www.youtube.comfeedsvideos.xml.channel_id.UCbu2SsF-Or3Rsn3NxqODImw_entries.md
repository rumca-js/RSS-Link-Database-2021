Modern Warfare has missing guns, Cold War is taking over Warzone with Zombies, and there’s a new Call of Duty and Battlefield releasing later this year. We’re dedicating this episode to your thoughts, feelings, and comments about what you want to do next.

When Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) launched it invigorated both a lapsed Call Of Duty fan base and pulled in people who used to play Battlefield. The Modern Warfare audience has recently felt pushed aside when Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War took over both the season pass and Warzone storyline. There’s also a rumored nuke event at the end of Season 2 that might finally erase Modern Warfare locations from the battle royale map. While Modern Warfare and Cold War do have their own fanbases, at least for now, it doesn’t look like Activision is accommodating both of them and is favoring Cold War. Players that own a base PS4 might not even be able to fit both games on their hard drive. In our previous, It’s Time To Say Goodbye To Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare episode a lot of you expressed strong feelings about the transition and what you’re doing next.

In this episode, we’re going to dive into your comments as a jumping-off point to talk about the three missing weapons of Modern Warfare, the CX-9, Raal, and Sykov as well as missing operator Soap. We’ll dive into how the Cold War takeover of Warzone is going, zombies event, and some of your fears about the engine. Finally, we're listening to those of you who are waiting for the next Call of Duty game and why you may wind up back at Battlefield 6 at the end of this year.
