One year ago today, on March 12, 2020, The Current aired this session with Nathaniel Rateliff. It was recorded in our studio just a few days earlier, with host Jade. It was the last visit to our studio by a nationally touring musician prior to the pandemic; Rateliff was in the Twin Cities for two nights of shows at the State Theatre in Minneapolis.

Rateliff was touring in support of "And It's Still Alright," his newly released solo album. "I try to write some of these songs about trying to talk about being vulnerable; and allowing ourselves as people to be vulnerable to one another," Rateliff said to Jade during the interview. "I think it's important, we don't really do it enough."

Perhaps the latter part of the remark was prescient on Rateliff's part; in the year since, it's safe to say many of us have experienced being vulnerable in ways we never expected. Enjoy these three songs from Nathaniel Rateliff, recorded in The Current studio in March 2020.
