One of the greatest dwarves of the Third Age, Gimli is known for his fighting, his ferocity, and his friendships.  We cover his beginnings in the Blue Mountains, west of The Shire, to his time in Erebor, his journeys as a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, and his time after The Lord of the Rings as Lord of the Glittering Caves.\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings!  \n\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
