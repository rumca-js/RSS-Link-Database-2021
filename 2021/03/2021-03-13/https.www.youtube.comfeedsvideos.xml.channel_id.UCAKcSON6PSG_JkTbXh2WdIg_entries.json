It was recorded in our studio just a few days earlier, with host Jade. It was the last visit to our studio by a nationally touring musician prior to the pandemic; Rateliff was in the Twin Cities for two nights of shows at the State Theatre in Minneapolis.\n\nRateliff was touring in support of \"And It's Still Alright,\" his newly released solo album. \"I try to write some of these songs about trying to talk about being vulnerable; and allowing ourselves as people to be vulnerable to one another,\" Rateliff said to Jade during the interview. \"I think it's important, we don't really do it enough.\"\n\nPerhaps the latter part of the remark was prescient on Rateliff's part; in the year since, it's safe to say many of us have experienced being vulnerable in ways we never expected. Enjoy these three songs from Nathaniel Rateliff, recorded in The Current studio in March 2020.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"All Or Nothing\"\n4:30 \"And It's Still Alright\"\n8:13 \"Time Stands\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nNathaniel Rateliff \u2013 guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark, Tessa Bloch\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2015 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/10/29/nathaniel-rateliff-and-the-night-sweats-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2015 Nathaniel Rateliff Guitar Collection interview:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/11/01/the-current-s-guitar-collection-nathaniel-rateliff-1967-gibson-b25-12string\n2016 performance of \"SOB\" at Rock the Garden:\nhttps://youtu.be/B31zagnQU3w\n2018 Microshow: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/09/10/nathaniel-rateliff-and-the-night-sweats-perform-a-microshow-at-the-turf-club\n2020 solo studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/03/12/nathaniel-rateliff-solo-session-complete-video-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#nathanielrateliff", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VVEGKSSlV8", "date_published": "2021-03-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
