They say the 2nd time's a charm... right?

Let's see if I can finally get all 16 hard drives recognized by the Raspberry Pi!

All proceeds from superchats, merch sales, new sponsorships, any ad revenue, or one-off donations I receive today (3/14/2021) will be applied towards a one-time donation to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, to support their mission of educational computing.

You can also support them directly here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/support-us/
