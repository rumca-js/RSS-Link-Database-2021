When you look at farmland sales, you\u2019re typically talking about 100\u2019s of acres. But thousands of acres? Those are blue-moon events made by very big buyers. It had it be someone as big if not bigger than a billion dollar insurance company.\n\nO\u2019Keefe dug deeper and forwarded his findings to his Land Report 100 Research Team. A few minutes later, he gets this response: \u201cEver hear of Bill Gates?\u201d\n\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s team followed the paper trail up the chain: That LLC is associated with the Angelina Agriculture Co is controlled by Cascade Investment, L.L.C. Cascade Investment, L.L.C. is what\u2019s called a \u201cfamily office\u201d located in Kirkland, Washington that goes by the name Bill and Melinda Gates Investments, or BMGI. \n\nMichael Larson is the chief investment officer for the Gates Foundation. Larson was headhunted to work for Bill Gates in 1994. And after the 2008 financial crisis, the farmland empire began: Larson swooped up \u201cat least 100,000 acres of farmland\u201d all over the country in places like California, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, and more, on behalf of Gates. By 2017, the Agriculture Company of America sold half-a-billion-dollars worth of farmland. And the buyer? The paper trail led right back to none other than Cascade Investment. Which is definitely not outside the realm of possibility - buuut that\u2019s probably not the truth.\n\nAfter Bill bought nearly 25,000 acres of land west of Phoenix, Arizona - the media was quick to pick up the rumor that Bill Gates was planning on building \u201cthe city of the future\u201d. So it\u2019s understandable that when news broke of Bill\u2019s farmland gains, the media was quick to call Bill the \u201cSustainable Agriculture Champion\u201d. But like most things, reality is oftentimes a lot less glamorous than the theories.\n\nGates and his money manager, Larson, have a very simple relationship. Larson grows the money, and Gates gives it away. \n\n-----------------------\n\nNo Spirit, Kyle McEvoy, Dillan Witherow - Campfire https://chll.to/25a3ba7c \n\nThis video was sponsored by DataCamp\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
