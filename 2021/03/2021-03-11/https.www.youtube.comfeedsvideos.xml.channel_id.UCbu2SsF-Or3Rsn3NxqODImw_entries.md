Denuvo's Anti-Cheat tech is coming to PlayStation 5 consoles, Xbox games are lighting up the Steam best-sellers list, and Apex on Switch is not the way to go. It's a packed episode of Console Crew!

If you thought Xbox's acquisition of Bethesda was the only big gaming console news drop for the week, you were wrong! The Console Crew gang is here to round up the biggest events of the week.

The discussion kicks off with PlayStation implementing Denuvo Anti-Cheat tech on the PlayStation 5. No one wants to play against cheaters, but is the tech itself going to impact our gaming at all? The crew also discusses Forza Horizon 4 lighting up the Steam bestseller list, even though it's a three-year-old game going for full price. Finally, Apex Legends came out on Switch this week, and Jordan discusses his time with it. Spoilers, it's not the place to play Respawn's excellent battle royale title/

Console Crew is your weekly Friday roundup of the biggest news from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, hosted by Lucy James, Tamoor Hussain, and Jordan Ram√©e. Subscribe to youtube.com/GameSpot to never miss an episode.

Check out a side by side comparison of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time's new next-gen PS5 update with the PS4 Pro version in 4K. They look visually similar, but when you compare them side by side the PS5 version is sharper. You'll also notice some slight tweaks in lighting and color, as well as quicker load times for the PS5.

Apex Legends arrived on the Nintendo Switch, and we take a side by side comparison to see how it stacks up to PC gameplay.

Apex Legends released on the Nintendo Switch, allowing players to drop into the popular battle royale on the go. Unfortunately, sacrifices in performance had to be made for it to work on the Switch, and we do a side by side comparison to see the details.

We take a look at the in-game menus, weapons, abilities, and combat and compare it to PC gameplay. Issues such as stuttering, pop-in's, frame drops, and low resolution textures appear on the Switch version, making it not ideal for the serious competitor. But now, Apex Legends has arrived on every major console, and is playable on all platforms.
