The TOFU by Oratek is the first board I've had in hand that has a built-in M.2 slot so I can finally use a native NVMe SSD directly on the Pi, something I've been hoping to do for years!

But it has a few other tricks up its sleeve. Oratek is a Swiss company, and just like the Swiss Army Knife from the same country, it packs a lot of functionality into a 9cm^2 board!
