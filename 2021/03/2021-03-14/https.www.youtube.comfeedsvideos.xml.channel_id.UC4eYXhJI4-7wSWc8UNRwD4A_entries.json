Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | March 15, 2021\nXavier Om\u00e4r decided to turn his Tiny Desk home concert into a whole Texas affair. Initially, Om\u00e4r wanted to recreate the look of the Desk: \"I wanted to kind of bring the feeling of Tiny Desk back, so I had booked a library,\" he said. Ultimately the library didn't work out, but Rosella Coffee and Wine in his home base of San Antonio proved to be a great match for his sound--spacious and airy.\n\nOm\u00e4r's career began in Christian music under the moniker SPZRKT, before he moved into secular R&B and hip-hop. Through his first couple of projects and work with Seattle DJ and producer, Sango, the 27-year-old singer's heart-on-sleeve approach quickly created a buzz. His latest album, if You Feel, was high on my favorite albums list of 2020.\n\nThe Alamo City resident and his cohorts orchestrated a charismatic and vocally rich show. The set list perfectly depicts the emotional arch of if You Feel. For good measure, he plays the song that put him on the map, 2016's \"Blind Man.\" This is undoubtedly Xavier Om\u00e4r's best live performance on record. He's on a clear path to greatness in R&B music.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Like I Feel\"\n\"Blind Man\"\n\"SURF\"\n\"So Much More\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nXavier Om\u00e4r: vocals\nTalyce Hays: vocals\nJay Wile: vocals\nAlana Holmes: vocals\nBilly Ray Blunt Jr.: guitar\nJustin Crawford: keys\nKorey Davison: bass\nJosh Greene: drums\nKevin Davison: saxophone\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Screenville Films\nAudio: David Gaum\u00e9, Alfredo De la Garza, Josef Rodriguez\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#xavieromar #tinydesk #nprmusic #rnb", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD9hyjbTuF0", "date_published": "2021-03-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
