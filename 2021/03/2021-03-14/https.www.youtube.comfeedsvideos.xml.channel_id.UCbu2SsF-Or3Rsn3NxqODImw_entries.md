Xbox Wireless Headset: https://amzn.to/30RMnbY

The new official headset for Xbox Series X|S, and other Microsoft platforms, is a no-frills, high-quality audio device.


The new Xbox Wireless Headset is Microsoft's flagship audio device for the Xbox Series X and its family of consoles. The bottom line is that for $100, this headset delivers almost everything you'd want from high-end audio. It also has some useful features and impressive build quality to boot.

In the video above, we review the Xbox Wireless Headset after spending a few days using it in games such as Gears 5, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Tetris Effect Connected, Forza Horizon 4, and Lost Odyssey. We also cranked up some music to see how the headset handled the finer audio details. Bass sounds bold while mids and highs came through clean, even at higher volumes.

It's also quite comfortable to use for long sessions, thanks to the pleather upholstery and foam padding on the ear cups--although those with very thick hair or larger heads may have trouble getting these on since they don't extend that far. You can stretch and twist the headset without worry as well thanks to its durable and flexible frame.

There are other perks like intuitive volume control on the ear cups, Dolby Atmos and DTS Headphone:X, a flexible low-profile microphone, and strong battery life.Â 

Overall, it delivers what you need out of a high-quality gaming headset. For more details on our experience, check out the full Xbox Wireless Headset review: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-wireless-headset-review/1100-6488797/
