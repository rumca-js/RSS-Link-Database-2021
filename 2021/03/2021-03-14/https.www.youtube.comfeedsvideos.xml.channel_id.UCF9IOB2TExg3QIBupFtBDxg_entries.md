UK, Third injection

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/13/pensioners-may-get-vaccine-booster-august-avoid-winter-wave/

Pensioners, possible booster in August / September

Waiting until winter could be too late

Prof Anthony Harnden, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation

Top up would be needed, protect against a new variant or as a safety net

(as the duration of protection is unknown)

Possible third wave affecting the vulnerable elderly next winter

Annual Covid-19 vaccinations could be necessary in the years to come

(Or not, if immunity lasts for a long time)

AZ 14th March, vaccine is safe

https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/update-on-the-safety-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca.html

17 million people vaccinated in the European Union (EU) and UK with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca 

No increased incidence in any defined age group, gender, batch or in any particular country.

8 March data

15 events of DVT and 22 events of pulmonary embolism

Much lower than would be expected to occur naturally

In clinical trials, number of thrombotic events was small, lower in the vaccinated group

No evidence of increased bleeding in over 60,000 participants enrolled.

there are also no confirmed issues related to any batch of our vaccine used across Europe, or the rest of the world

Quality testing, 60 quality tests are conducted by AstraZeneca

20 independent testing laboratories

Epidemiology of venous thromboembolism

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624298/

Incidence rate

Men, 130 per 100,000 per year

Women, 110 per 100,000 per year

That’s 10 per month per 100,000

That’s 120 per million per month

Therefore for 3 million of the population 360 thromboembolic events expected per month




Early data, vaccination and long covid

Vaccine may alleviate symptoms in long Covid

Patient groups and scientists

About 10% symptomatic for 12 weeks, some longer 

20 to 50% reduced symptoms, fatigue, headaches, brain fog

Effects may be temporary

Dr David Strain, University of Exeter

Runs long Covid clinics, member of the NHS long covid taskforce

We are getting people reporting improvements, and it’s quite widespread, about half of the people we are asking. 

There is a major reporting bias, though - the people who notice something remarkable are the ones shouting about it.”

This provides a bit of hope for people who have been struggling with this for 12 months or more, just to feel better for a bit.

But also as researchers it tells us a lot of information: does this give us clues about how we should be treating it? We need to look very carefully

Lou Barnes, coordinates 4,000-strong Post Covid Syndrome support group

Estimates 20%

Improvements lasting for around three weeks

Others reported feeling worse for a short time

Professor Danny Altmann, immunologist, Imperial College, London

It’s very interesting because we still have no clue about the mechanisms in long Covid and what to do for patients, 

and also because many sufferers are very anxious about their immune status. 

This has led to some paradoxical vaccine hesitancy

Professor Eleanor Riley, immunologist, University of Edinburgh

One of the hypotheses about chronic fatigue syndrome is that it is a failure of the immune system to reset after a viral infection. 

And if that’s the case, then giving the immune system a jolt, for example by vaccination, may help to reset. 

But that is purely speculation

It’s possible it may turn out to be random

Seems to be two forms of long covid

After severe and milder disease



CoViD tongue

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-tongue

Previously reported mouth and tongue changes

Dry mouth, loss of taste (dysgeusia) and fungal infection (oral thrush). 

Changes in tongue sensation, muscle pain while chewing, swelling in the mouth and ulcers on the tongue or inner surface of the mouth and lips

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dth.14717

Reporters ask to identify new features

Loss of smell, skin rashes, delirium

Tongue doesn’t look normal, white and patchy 

What causes COVID tongue?

Could be direct viral effect or an immune response

Increased susceptible to fungal infections in the mouth

However, anti-fungals don’t seem to work

How common is COVID tongue?

Up to a quarter of hospitalised patients had tongue or mouth changes

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjd.19564

Less common mild disease

Don’t knows

If it can be an isolated feature

When in the condition it arises

Now a specific question

Italy, La Repubblica

Fear has turned into anger and exhaustion

We’re waiting for the vaccines like pioneers in a Western movie, surrounded by Indians, scanning the horizon and waiting for the Seventh Cavalry

Extensive local measures now being taken

Vincenzo De Luca, Governor of Campania

it is clear that we are in the third wave all over Italy, that it is necessary to take exceptional measures

Czech Republic

Could achieve herd immunity

UK, no third wave

https://covid.joinzoe.com/data#levels-over-time

Last week in the UK

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-cases-drop-by-a-third

COVID cases drop by a third

Based on around one million weekly reporters 7,600 recent swab tests

March 12, 2021, cases, + 5,494

Last week, cases, + 8,111

Down 32%

Prevalence, 1 in 613 in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID

UK R = 0.8

England, 0.8

Wales, 0.9

Scotland, 0.8

(Today, UK, 0.6 to 0.8)

European vaccinations progress

Used less than half of its stocks of AZ

Used a third of stocks of Moderna

3 million over 80 and high risks unvaccinated

France

Used less than three-quarters of their vaccine stocks

Belgium

Has used less than a third of its vaccine stocks

Public reluctance to take AstraZeneca

Bureaucracy and incompetence

UK, vaccination progress

Third of adult population now vaccinated

Now calling in all over 56 years, over 50s later this week

Increasing to 1 million doses per day this week (Moderna arrives)

UK, Top nine priority groups

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-care-home-and-healthcare-settings-posters/covid-19-vaccination-first-phase-priority-groups

Group 9, all those over 50
