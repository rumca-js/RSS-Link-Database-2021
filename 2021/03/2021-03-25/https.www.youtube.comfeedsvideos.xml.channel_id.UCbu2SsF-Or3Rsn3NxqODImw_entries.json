Kurt Indovina steps in to host the show while Lucy is away, joining Tamoor and Jordan to discuss the biggest console-related events of the week.\n\nThe trio start with a discussion about Xbox Live, which is now called Xbox network. The name change seems to precede plans that Microsoft has for transforming Xbox Live Gold, as Xbox Insiders are reporting that they've begun testing online multiplayer for free-to-play games, Looking 4 Groups, and party chat without the need to pay for them.\n\nFollowing all the Xbox talk, the group dives into a conversation about video game preservation, especially in the light of reports that Sony may be closing the online stores for PS3, PSP, and PS Vita. Tamoor gets a tad heated about it.\n\nConsole Crew is your weekly Friday roundup of the biggest news from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, hosted by Lucy James, Tamoor Hussain, and Jordan Ram\u00e9e.
