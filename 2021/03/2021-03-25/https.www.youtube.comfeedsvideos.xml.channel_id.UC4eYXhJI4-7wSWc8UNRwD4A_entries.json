Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | March 25, 2021\nThe back of a van on a sunny day holding an acoustic guitar is a far cry from the usual setting where I'd see\u00a0Buck Meek. More likely, I'd be in a dark club; Buck's intense electric guitar and backing vocals are a part of what makes up my favorite rock band these days,\u00a0Big Thief. But here, home is Buck's Toyota Land Cruiser in Topanga Canyon, Calif.; Buck Meek is singing about the clouds and his favorite new word, pareidolia, which also happens to be the opening track to his 2021 album,\u00a0Two Saviors.\n\nPareidolia is, as Buck Meek explains, \"this human instinct to put symbol to stimulus.\" He says, \"I've been spending this time of solitude in the canyon here spending a lot of time observing the clouds and things\" \u2014 in other words, finding shapes and objects in clouds and objects where none intended to exist and perhaps turning them into stories or songs or just letting your mind wander. The Texas native has a tender voice with a bit of a yodel and a resplendent way with words. After three songs from\u00a0Two Saviors,\u00a0Buck treats us to a new song written in quarantine titled \"The Undae Dunes,\" once again drawing pictures in the sky, this time of rockets and perhaps an astronaut and a love, all from the back of a Cruiser.\n\nSET LIST\n \u25aa \"Pareidolia\"\n \u25aa \"Two Saviors\"\n \u25aa \"Halo Light\"\n \u25aa \"The Undae Dunes\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u25aa Buck Meek: vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\n \u25aa Video and Audio: Scott Cornish\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u25aa Producer: Bob Boilen\n \u25aa Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u25aa Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u25aa Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u25aa Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame\n \u25aa Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n \u25aa Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#buckmeek #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOf3tD0sMxQ", "date_published": "2021-03-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
