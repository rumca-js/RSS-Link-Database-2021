Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | March 3, 2021\nJack Harlow's Tiny Desk (home) concert feels like the arrival of a rap superstar. Tucked in a homey-looking space in Los Angeles surrounded by bookshelves and vintage furniture, the Louisville, Ky., emcee delivers a performance with the confidence of an old pro. His set, however, is the first time he's relied solely on live instrumentation to bring his songs to life. \"It's been a long time since I had a chance to perform and I've never done it like this,\" he says.\n\nThis is a far stretch from the kid with loose curls and specs frolicing with his hometown friends, but his success should serve as a reminder of the importance of artist development. He's been able to slow cook for a few years, consistently dropping mixtapes and visuals until he landed a big hit last year in \"WHATS POPPIN.\" That performance earned him a Grammy nomination ahead of his very impressive debut album, Thats What They All Say.\n\nFor this turn at the Tiny Desk, Harlow, his band and some background singers deliver a megamix of highlights from the album. The orchestration underscores his sentimental and introspective side on songs like \"Same Guy\" and \"Funny Seeing You Here,\" but it also elevates the melody, which is the true hero here. Over the past few years, the 22-year-old rapper has steadily ticked the boxes for a successful career, and this showing undoubtedly checks the performer section.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Rendezvous\"\n\"21C / Delta\"\n\"Funny Seeing You Here\"\n\"Same Guy\"\n\"Creme/ONCE MAY COMES\"\n\"Whats Poppin\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJack Harlow: vocals\nO'Neil \"Doctor O\" Palmer: keys\nRico Nichols: drums\nJoe Cleveland - bass\nRob Gueringer: guitar\nErik B: vocals\nChimera Patrice: vocals\nPorcha Clay: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Ace Pro, Chadrick Fellers / WastedPotential, Donald Turner, Karis West, Kylie Hazzard\nAudio: Nickie Jon Pab\u00f3n, CJ Blair\nPlayback: Kenny Woods\nBackline: Jonathan Castillo\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#jackharlow #tinydesk #hiphop #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNrerhak_pY", "date_published": "2021-03-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
