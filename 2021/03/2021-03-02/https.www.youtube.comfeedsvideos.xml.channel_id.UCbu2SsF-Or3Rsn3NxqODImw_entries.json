How tall is he? And most importantly, how does he like his eggs? BDG answers those and more in this special Q&A.\n\nBDG's channel: https://www.youtube.com/briandavidgilbert\n\nYou might know Brian David Gilbert as the host of Polygon's Unraveled. If you're not familiar with his work, he has taken on gargantuan tasks such as solving the Zelda timeline in 15 minutes. And by solving we mean taking everything that's canon and isn't and then putting it order.\n\nI think most would agree that it's a foolish endeavor. But foolish endeavors are exactly what internet sweetheart Brian David Gilbert is all about. He's also read 337 Skyrim books, ranked over 200 Mega Man robots, attempted to make sense of Kingdom Hearts, and tried to make all 78 food recipes from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in one day.\n\nNaturally, it's all fantastic to watch and, as host and creator, Brian David Gilbert approaches each challenge with charm, humor, and a frankly alarming level of earnestness. But what makes him tick? Do we know the\u00a0real\u00a0Brian David Gilbert? Why is he the way he is? We decided to find out by sitting him down and interviewing him.\n\nSpecifically, we asked him 27 of the most important questions that'll help you truly get to know him. Like what is he doing now? What's his five-year plan? Favorite dance move? In fact, where did he even learn to dance?\n\nFind out more about Brian here: https://www.briandavidgilbert.com/ or follow him on Twitter @briamgilbert.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O0VVoPiHAo", "date_published": "2021-03-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Aliens: Fireteam Announcement Trailer", "description": "Check out the official announcement trailer for the Aliens: Fireteam game taking place in the Aliens universe!

Here\u2019s a look at how the reliable submachine gun has evolved over the course of 14 titles.\n\nThe MP5 is one of Call of Duty\u2019s most well-known submachine guns. It\u2019s been featured in more than a dozen games and modes and has seen quite a few changes. In this video, we check out it\u2019s evolution within the entire series. Everything from its introduction in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, to its futuristic stylings of Infinite Warfare and beyond.\n\nThe reliable MP5 is a fan favorite. It usually delivers a fast fire rate with low recoil. In most Call of Duty games, it\u2019s the strongest submachine gun in terms of damage. Unfortunately, the same can\u2019t always can\u2019t always be said when it comes to Treyarch\u2019s Zombies modes. Submachine guns and zombies don\u2019t mix very well and can leave you wanting a stronger weapon in later rounds.\u00a0\n\nEven every iteration, there are a few staples that make up that classic MP5 look. This includes its iron sights and familiar body shape. In futuristic titles like Infinite Warfare, the MP5 goes by other names like the VPR, but after getting your hands on them, the feel and performance of this submachine gun stands out and feels familiar. While the look and style has changed over the years, there\u2019s no denying it\u2019s smooth handling and solid time to kill. It\u2019s a gun we COD fans can\u2019t live without.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:30 - Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\n01:03 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\n01:38 - Call of Duty Black Ops\n02:09 - Black Ops Pack-a-Punch\n02:30- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\n03:06 - Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 \n03:18 - Black Ops 2 - Pack-a-Punch\n03:40 - Black Ops 3\n04:03- Black Ops 3  Pack-a-Punch\n04:32 - Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare\n04:53 - Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare - Pack-a-Punch\n05:21 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered\n05:42 - Call of Duty Mobile\n06:06 - Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019\n06:49 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered\n07:25 - Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\n07:56 - Black Ops Cold War - Pack-a-Punch", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyNvSNoCU-g", "date_published": "2021-03-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "It Takes Two Is Gaming's First Proper Rom-Com (Feat.
