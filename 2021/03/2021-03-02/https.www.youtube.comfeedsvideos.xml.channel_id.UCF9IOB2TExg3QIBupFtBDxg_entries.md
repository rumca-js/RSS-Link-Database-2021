President Biden

Enough vaccines for every adult by the end of May

Two months earlier than expected

100 in 100 well on track

About 1.74 million per day

Merck now helping Johnson & Johnson

We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May

the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War Two

Stay vigilant

this fight is far from over

We cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable

We can't assume that

Vaccines for children

Dr. Fauci, MD, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Children under 12 years very likely, end of 2021 or beginning of 2022

Based on, 

If you project realistically when we'll get enough data to be able to say that elementary school children will be able to be vaccinated, I would think that would be, at the earliest, the end of the year, and very likely, the first quarter of 2022
 
High school students will likely be able to get vaccinated this fall

Closer to herd immunity

Encouraged Americans to continue to wear face masks, avoid crowds, and follow social distancing guidelines

you've got to get that baseline down lower than it is now

Gov. Greg Abbott

End of the state wide mask mandate

Businesses can open at 100% capacity March 10

state mandates are no longer needed

Mississippi 

Removing the order on mask wearing, today

Michigan,

Easing capacity limits on restaurants, public and residential gatherings

South Carolina, Massachusetts, Chicago 

San Francisco

Easing of rules on museums, cinemas, gyms and indoor dining

EU

Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz

Austria would work with Israel and Denmark on second generation vaccines

no longer rely on the EU in the future

European Medicines Agency, too slow

We must therefore prepare for further mutations and should no longer be dependent only on the EU for the production of second-generation vaccines

Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen

Bid for supplies of Israel’s leftover vaccines

Mr Kurz and Ms Frederiksen going to Israel

Poland

Talking to China about supplies


Slovakia

Two million doses of the Sputnik delivered (not been approved by the European Medicines Agency)

Czech

Due to buy Sputnik

Hungary

Already approved and bought 2 million doses of Sputnik 

Viktor Orbán, photo of himself being vaccinated by the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine (5 million doses)

We’ve sought to do something together that we could have managed more successfully on an individual basis – take a look at the examples of Britain or Serbia


France

Regional leaders trying to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical suppliers

Germany

Ordered 30 million extra doses of the Pfizer and 20m doses with CureVac

Ursula von der Leyen

We have all agreed that there will be no parallel negotiations or parallel contracts

Oxford Astra Zeneca, not given to over 65 years old nor to people with any disease/health condition

Currently it seems like I´ll have to wait at least a year for my vaccination

Advise, 1g paracetamol before and for every 6 hours after vaccination if minor side effects appear

First, there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. WHO doesn’t recommend limiting trade and movement.

Early effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and ChAdOx1 adenovirus vector vaccine on symptomatic disease, hospitalisations and mortality in older adults in the UK: a test negative case control study
 
https://khub.net/documents/135939561/430986542/Early+effectiveness+of+COVID+vaccines.pdf/ffd7161c-b255-8e88-c2dc-88979fc2cc1b?t=1614617945615

Objectives

Real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine and …

Astrazeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine against….

Confirmed COVID-19, hospitalisations and deaths

To estimate effectiveness on the UK variant of concern. 

Setting 

Community COVID-19 PCR testing in England 

8th December 2020 and 19th February 2021

All adults in England aged 70 years and older (over 7.5 million)

All symptomatic COVID-19 testing in the community in over 70s

Test negative case control design 

174,731 PCR tests

156,930 of these (89.8%) linked to vaccination data

44,590 (28.4%) were positive tests

112,340 (71.6%) were negative

Interventions 

One and two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine

One dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine

Main outcome measures 

Symptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection

Hospitalisations and deaths with COVID-19. 

Symptomatic disease infection risk Results 

Individuals aged more than 80 years vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2

Higher odds of testing positive in the first 9 days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48)

Vaccine effects were noted from 10-13 days after vaccination

Reaching an effectiveness of 70% from 28-34 days, then plateauing

From 14 days after the second dose, vaccine effectiveness was 89%

(Fewer than 10 over 80 sent to ITU every day in UK)

Individuals aged more than70 years

Pfizer BNT162b2

Vaccine effectiveness reached 61% from 28-34 days then plateaued 

AZ ChAdOx1

Vaccine effects, were seen from 14-20 days

Reaching an effectiveness of 60% from 28-34 days

Further increasing to 73% from day 35 onwards

Risk of emergency hospitalisation and death results

One dose of BNT162b2

Additional 43% lower risk of emergency hospitalisation

Additional 51% lower risk of death

One dose of ChAdOx1

Additional 37% lower risk of emergency hospitalisation

Insufficient follow-up to assess the effect of ChAdOx1 on mortality

Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease

Single dose of either vaccine is approximately 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation

Single dose of BNT162b2 is 85% effective at preventing death

Single dose of ChAdOx1 unknown protective effect against death

Conclusion 

Significant reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV2 positive cases in older adults

Even greater protection against severe disease

Both vaccines show similar effects

Protection was maintained for more than 6 weeks

A second dose of BNT162b2 provides further protection against symptomatic disease

Second doses of ChAdOx1 have not yet been rolled out in England

There is a clear effect of the vaccines against the UK variant of concern

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam

Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation

not immunologically plausible the vaccine would work in younger age groups and not older ones.

Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE's head of immunisation, said it could.

If anything we would expect it to be a stronger protection from the vaccine

Lower down in the age range is that people's chances of being hospitalised and dying are much lower

France 

Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, can be given to people with underlying health conditions in the 65-74 age group

1.1m doses in country

Germany

Still not giving the AstraZeneca to the over-65s

Now under discussion

Large stocks of that vaccine waiting to be used

(Belgium, Poland, Italy, Sweden)

Professor Andrew Pollard, Oxford Vaccine group

Findings were stunning

5,000 people dying every day in Europe, important to increase confidence in vaccines

disappointing in some senses

really high levels of protection

support their decision making

Oxford vaccine distributed to low-income countries, Covax scheme
