Joint World Health Organization-China report

Coronavirus most likely jumped from animals to humans via an intermediate animal host

Concerns about the methodology and the process

the fact that the government in Beijing apparently helped to write it

Jake Sullivan, national security

It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government 

To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available it’s data from the earliest days of the outbreak

Much data collected by Chinese scientists, ahead of visit, then analyzed by the joint team

Dominic Dwyer, Australian microbiologist team member

U.S. trajectory mirrors the trends a few weeks ago in Europe

Please hold on a little while longer. I so badly want to be done

We are just almost there, but not quite yet

Country does not have the luxury of inaction

The coronavirus vaccine programme continues to go to plan

Vaccines are sufficiently reducing the number of people dying or needing hospital treatment

Infection rates do not risk a surge in hospital admissions

New coronavirus variants do not fundamentally change the risk of lifting restrictions
