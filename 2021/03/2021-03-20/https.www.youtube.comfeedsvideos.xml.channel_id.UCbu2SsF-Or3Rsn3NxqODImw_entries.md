Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has been teasing a nuke event and possible map change since mysterious bunkers opened up on the Warzone map nine months ago. It hasn’t happened yet and we’re looking over rumors, leaks, and what’s happened so far to speculate if Cold War Season 3 will finally deliver. 

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has been teasing a nuke event and a possible map change since mysterious bunkers opened up on the Warzone map nine months ago. It hasn’t happened yet and we’re wondering if Cold War season two will finally deliver. There have been a number of unconfirmed leaks recently containing audio files referencing races, plague zones, Verdansk being overrun with zombies, and nukes inbound. These could be hinting at a map change, a limited-time mode similar to The Haunting Of Verdansk, or a season-ending event similar to Know Your History. So far, Cold War Season two has seen a mysterious ship carrying Nova 6 gas crash into the battle royale map and split apart. Zombies that players can trigger and fight by activating Trials computers have migrated from the Ship to the Prison and Hospital as well as started evolving. 

In this video, we talk about how slowly the event has been progressing and the mixed messaging about it on official Call Of Duty social media. We’ll cover the audience mismatch between Cold War and Modern Warfare players and why the Cold War takeover is still having a negative impact on the battle royale map. We’ll talk over Warzone’s past events and why limited time modes are important. Finally, we’ll take a look at your comments and how you’re feeling about Modern Warfare and what Activision could do to keep Infinity Ward’s game alive. 

Fans are hoping Call Of Duty: Warzone will have some type of major event between Season 2 and Season 3, which could happen in mid-April. Call Of Duty: Warzone seasons typically run about 10 weeks, with the current Battle Pass ending on April 20.

Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the weaponry of Resident Evil 4, including the powerful Striker shotgun, the distinctive Red 9 pistol, and the ridiculous Infinite Rocket Launcher.

Resident Evil 4 saw Capcom’s horror franchise venture into the action genre for the first time and gave players access to an arsenal of unique weapons, including the TMP submachine gun, the H&K VP70M handgun, and the Thompson M1A1, known in-game as the Chicago Typewriter.

In the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series , Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of Resident Evil 4, and compares them to their real-life counterparts.

Should you play The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in 2021? Jake Dekker revisits Bethesda's classic to see how it holds up 15 years later. 

You don’t have to look hard to find Oblivion’s blemishes, but if you can look past them there is an imaginative, ambitious fantasy adventure that, in many ways, Bethesda hasn’t been able to replicate since. The Elder Scrolls has been around since 1994. However, it didn’t stake its claim in the console space until 2002 with The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Morrowind had a lot of firsts for the series. Most notably, it was the first fully 3D mainline Elder Scrolls game.

Morrowind laid the groundwork for Oblivion, and eventually Skyrim. In this video, Jake revisits Oblivion for its 15th anniversary in order to see what made it so special. From the awkward voice acting to the incredible quests, Oblivion had is still a memorable experience.

Oblivion originally came out for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC back in 2006, but it’s currently available on Xbox Game Pass for subscribers.
