And back in October 2017, we were lucky enough to welcome the Melbourne-based musician into our studio.\n\nIn The Current's studio, Sultana orchestrated a carefully choreographed performance of their songs \"Jungle\" and \"Notion,\" using numerous loops to lay down guitar tracks \u2014 starting with the basic chord progression, then moving to ornamentation, followed by a bassline. At that point, Sultana shifted to percussion, and when all the pieces were in place, started singing to the layers of music they create. Sultana also adds some rocking guitar parts to each song, showcasing a playing style that invites comparisons to Prince.\n\nWatch Tash Sultana's spellbinding performances above. \n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Jungle\"\n8:09 \"Notion\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nTash Sultana \u2013 everything\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Helen Teague\nAudio: Corey Schreppel\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/10/25/tash-sultana-rocks-out-in-the-current-studio\n2021 virtual session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2021/03/04/tash-sultana-virtual-session\n2021 Album of the Week (March 15), \"Terra Firma\"\nhttp://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2021/03/15/album-of-the-week-tash-sultana-terra-firma\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#tashsultana", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPzEGsNOz_A", "date_published": "2021-03-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
