Tash Sultana's new album, "Terra Firma," is our Album of the Week. And back in October 2017, we were lucky enough to welcome the Melbourne-based musician into our studio.

In The Current's studio, Sultana orchestrated a carefully choreographed performance of their songs "Jungle" and "Notion," using numerous loops to lay down guitar tracks — starting with the basic chord progression, then moving to ornamentation, followed by a bassline. At that point, Sultana shifted to percussion, and when all the pieces were in place, started singing to the layers of music they create. Sultana also adds some rocking guitar parts to each song, showcasing a playing style that invites comparisons to Prince.

Watch Tash Sultana's spellbinding performances above.
