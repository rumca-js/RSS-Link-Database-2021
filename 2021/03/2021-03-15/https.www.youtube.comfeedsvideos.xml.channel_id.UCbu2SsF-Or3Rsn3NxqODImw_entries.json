All that and more answered by the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog, Roger Craig Smith.\n\nRoger Craig Smith was the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog from 2010 to 2021. He lent his vocal talents to Sonic Colors, Sonic Generations, Sonic Boom, and Sonic Forces among many other titles.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we decided to take to the internet to figure out what the people want to know most about him and Sonic. Watch as we ask Roger the most searched questions about the blue blur to see what he had to say, and find out how well he knows the character himself.\u00a0\n\nBut you've probably also heard his voice in more than just Sonic games. Roger Craig Smith is prolific and is also the voice of a bunch of other iconic video game characters including Ezio Auditore da Firenze from the Assassin\u2019s Creed series, Batman in Batman: Arkham Origins, and Mirage in Apex Legends. These performances are iconic in their own right, and if you want to see Roger break down those roles you can check out the other video we did with him here: https://youtu.be/svDDP6nx5jg\n\nIf you want to keep up to date with Roger you can follow him on Twitter and Instagram @RogerCraigSmith, and he also has a website you can check out: https://www.rogercraigsmith.com/\n\n#Sonic #Q&A #Interview", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZkdGv9h9Hw", "date_published": "2021-03-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fortnite Chapter 2 - Season 6 Battle Pass Trailer", "description": "Check out the official Battle Pass Trailer for Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 6!

The bottom line is that for $100, this headset delivers almost everything you'd want from high-end audio. It also has some useful features and impressive build quality to boot.\n\nIn the video above, we review the Xbox Wireless Headset after spending a few days using it in games such as Gears 5, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Tetris Effect Connected, Forza Horizon 4, and Lost Odyssey. We also cranked up some music to see how the headset handled the finer audio details. Bass sounds bold while mids and highs came through clean, even at higher volumes.\n\nIt's also quite comfortable to use for long sessions, thanks to the pleather upholstery and foam padding on the ear cups--although those with very thick hair or larger heads may have trouble getting these on since they don't extend that far. You can stretch and twist the headset without worry as well thanks to its durable and flexible frame.\n\nThere are other perks like intuitive volume control on the ear cups, Dolby Atmos and DTS Headphone:X, a flexible low-profile microphone, and strong battery life.\u00a0\n\nOverall, it delivers what you need out of a high-quality gaming headset.
