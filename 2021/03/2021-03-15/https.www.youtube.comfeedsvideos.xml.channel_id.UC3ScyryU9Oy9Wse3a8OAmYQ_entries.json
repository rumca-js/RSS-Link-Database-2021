This 2012 documentary reveals how close the world came to a nuclear nightmare. \n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate\u200b.\n\nIn the desperate hours and days after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the fate of thousands of Japanese citizens fell into the hands of a small corps of engineers, firemen and soldiers who risked their lives to prevent the Daiichi nuclear complex from complete meltdown. FRONTLINE tells the story of the workers struggling frantically to reconnect power inside the plant\u2019s pitch-dark and highly radioactive reactor buildings; the nuclear experts and officials in the prime minister\u2019s office fighting to get information as the crisis spiraled out of control; and the plant manager who disobeyed his executives\u2019 orders when he thought it would save the lives of his workers.\n\nLove FRONTLINE?
