Phase I trial, Protease inhibitor\n\nhttps://www.europeanpharmaceuticalreview.com/news/148536/novel-oral-antiviral-for-sars-cov-2-progresses-in-phase-i-trial/\n\nBackground science\n\nViral proteases are enzymes, endopeptidases\n\nEncoded by the genetic material (DNA or RNA) of viral pathogens\n\nCatalyze cleavage of specific peptide bonds in viral precursors\n\nThese proteolytic events are essential for the completion of the viral infectious cycle\n\nProtease inhibitors, bind to a viral enzyme, called a protease\n\nPrevent the virus from replicating\n\nProtease inhibitors, used to treat HIV and hepatitis C\n\nAssess tolerability and safety of multiple ascending doses of PF-07321332\n\nPhase I study, healthy adults \n\nRandomised, double-blind, sponsor-open, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose escalation study in healthy adults evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PF-07321332.\n\nProtease inhibitor, demonstrated potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. \n\nCould be prescribed orally at the first sign of infection\n\nPfizer also investigating an intravenously administered protease inhibitor, PF-07304814, in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.\n\nNovember??", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXrNQa6Vb9c", "date_published": "2021-03-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user":
