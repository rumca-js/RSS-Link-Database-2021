ASUSTOR and Seagate sent me a brand new NAS and hard drives. They wanted me to see if my little Raspberry Pi NAS could keep up.

The results? Well, they might surprise you. This video details the hardware setup process and some thoughts on whether you might be better off buying a NAS for a small premium over DIY.
