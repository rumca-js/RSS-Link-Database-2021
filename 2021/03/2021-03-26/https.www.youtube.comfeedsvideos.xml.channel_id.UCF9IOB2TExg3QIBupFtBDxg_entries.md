Novel oral antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 progresses in Phase I trial, Protease inhibitor

https://www.europeanpharmaceuticalreview.com/news/148536/novel-oral-antiviral-for-sars-cov-2-progresses-in-phase-i-trial/

Background science

Viral proteases are enzymes, endopeptidases

Encoded by the genetic material (DNA or RNA) of viral pathogens

Catalyze cleavage of specific peptide bonds in viral precursors

These proteolytic events are essential for the completion of the viral infectious cycle

Protease inhibitors, bind to a viral enzyme, called a protease

Prevent the virus from replicating

Protease inhibitors, used to treat HIV and hepatitis C

Assess tolerability and safety of multiple ascending doses of PF-07321332

Phase I study, healthy adults 

Randomised, double-blind, sponsor-open, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose escalation study in healthy adults evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PF-07321332.

Protease inhibitor, demonstrated potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. 

Could be prescribed orally at the first sign of infection

Pfizer also investigating an intravenously administered protease inhibitor, PF-07304814, in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

Viral evolution

adenine, cytosine, uracil, guanine

Darwinian evolution

Species undergo random mutation

Making most less fit

But making a few more fit

Fit means compete, survive, reproduce

Natural selection will ‘select’ the more fit

Viruses usually become less virulent over time

Increased virulence / transmissibility

Mutations that increase transmissibility

Mutations that can avoid antibodies

Mutations that can avoid vaccination defences

## UK cases level, India increases

Friday 26th March
UK

Past 7 days

https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk

Cases, +38,424 (down 2%)

Deaths, +520 (down 31.4%)

Admissions, +2,918 (down 19.8%)

In hospital = 5,544 (20th March)

Bed occupancy down from 50% to under 5%

First dose: 28,991,188

Second dose: 2,775,481

CoViD tracker app

https://covid.joinzoe.com

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkG7RrdnbdE

Flattening of new cases, 10 days

R = around 1

One in 920 people have symptoms

Reasons for flattening

False positive, 1,000 cases

Under the age of 50

Under the age of 19

As predicted due to vaccinations

Reinfections, 352 cases from the app

However overall immunity working well

Half population vaccinated, 2nd to Israel

74% protection after first 30 days

Zero protection for 12 days

Risk of new variants minor after vaccination

What to do?

Greater awareness of symptoms

Testing everyone with symptoms

Do a better job in isolating people

Full vaccinations, getting back to normal

Confident we will be through this soon

Regional differences emerging

Wales and Scotland higher (schools returned earlier)

West Midlands turn upwards

SE and London cases going down

US

200 million in 100 days

That’s by 30th April

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/25/joe-biden-live-updates/

Averaging 2.5 million doses a day over last week

1.9 million per day needed

EU conference yesterday

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56529868

No export ban

Dr. Von der Leyen

I think it is clear that first of all the company has to catch up

has to honour the contract it has with European member states before it can engage again in exporting vaccines

India

Population

1,390,108,411 (UN, 2020)

https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/india-population/

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/03/25/india-coronavirus-cases-vaccine/

Cases, + 53,476

Highest figure since October

Higher proportion of cases seem to be asymptomatic

Deaths, + 250

Factors

Changes in behaviour

Waning immunity among those previously infected

Mumbai, 90% of new cases not in the slums

Massive internal movements and commuting

New variants

Elections and festivals soon, Kumbh Mela

Vaccination

Up to about 50 million

All Indians 45 and older, eligible for vaccines starting April 1

Oxford AZ

Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin

https://www.bharatbiotech.com/covaxin.html

Inactivated vaccines

n = 25,800

81% interim efficacy

Punjab

February to early March, 80% of cases UK variant

South Africa and Brazil present at lower levels

India variant, mostly Maharashtra

https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1707177

2 mutations that confer immune escape and increased infectivity

E484Q and L452R mutations

Found in about 15-20% of samples

Do not match any previously catalogued VOCs

Kerala, N440K, associated with immune escape
