<p>Google is prepping to delete my YouTube channel. As of today (March 26,
2021), I now cannot post for another two weeks. YouTube &quot;strikes&quot;
which are functionally unappealable (automatically rejected) last for 3
months. If they give thee concurrent strikes, you channel is permanently
deleted.</p>
<p>If YouTube Jannies delete my YouTube channel, remember that <strong>100% of my
videos are still easily viewable, including new videos I will make</strong>.
You have no excuse to whine if all you know how to do is consoooming
product on YouTube's walled garden:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow me on Odysee: <a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7">https://odysee.com/@Luke:7</a></li>
<li>Follow me on PeerTube: <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz">https://videos.lukesmith.xyz</a></li>
<li>Follow me on RSS: <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml">https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I can and have already done livestreams on
<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz">PeerTube</a>. Expect those as well.
LBRY/Odysee will probably have livestreams too soon.</p>
<h2 id="when-youre-banned-from-youtube-will-you-keep-making-videos">&quot;When you're banned from YouTube will you keep making videos?&quot;</h2>
<p>Yes, at <a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7">Odysee</a> and
<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz">PeerTube</a>. I will also probably actually
bring back <a href="https://notrelated.xyz">Not Related!</a> for real this time
because the first reason I made a podcast was to communicate with people
using less bandwidth.</p>
<p>I suppose my only regret is not shilling RSS, webrings and other
classical internet technology to free us from social media companies.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-youtube">The &quot;importance&quot; of YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube ad revenue by itself is a nice thing to have, but it is not a
huge loss if I lose it (less than minimum wagies make). Very few
megachannels actually make decent money on it and frankly, it's a kind
of bloodmoney if you ask me.</p>
<p>The only concern for me is that YouTube is still the vehicle by which
people find out about me and use other stuff I offer and that can mean
other sources of income for me.</p>
<p>While I try to push people into a decentralized internet, use RSS feeds,
superior platforms like Odysee and PeerTube, and encourage them to have
websites and the like, most people still passively use YouTube
recommendations and curation.</p>

<p>If you have friends who watch my YouTube channel or know of people on
other sites who do, make sure they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow me on RSS: <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml">https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml</a></li>

<p>Google is not going to be accidentally recommending new people to me
after they ban me. That's your job.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-they-giving-you-strikes-for">&quot;What are they giving you strikes for?&quot;</h2>
<p>To be clear, before this year, I never received any strikes, but now
I've received a warning and two strikes <em>all for old videos</em>.</p>
<p>I will emphasize that this is merely the sign of either: (1) coordinated
third-party mass-reports or (2) YouTube specifically and arbitrarily
adopting new standards in a bid to remove the channel.</p>
<p>The strikes are for the following very innocent videos:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a video I put up in either 2016 or 2017 where I made an ffmpeg
slideshow with a bunch of Pepe memes set to music. Deleted for
&quot;inciting violence.&quot; I can't find the original video of this, I
might've deleted it.</li>
<li>For a video I did sometime in 2020 when I in passing made jokes
about low-quality Indian tech channels that used to dominate
YouTube. Deleted for &quot;inciting violence.&quot;
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/thanks-luke-for-vanquishing-pajeettube:f">Here</a>
is the video so you can see how innocuous (also true) it was.</li>
<li>For a video I made maybe in 2018 or 2019 on <code>youtube-dl</code>.
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/downloading-videos-music-and-more-with:5">Here</a>
is the video. The absurdity is that I recommend people to use this
tool to back up my YouTube channel (and all of my videos are in
licensed permissively via Creative Commons). I guess it's a crime
to distribute my own videos on a video distribution platform!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the arbitrariness of Google today. If my channel survives the
storm of these strikes (which I severely doubt) expect me to be using
<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz">PeerTube</a> and
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7">Odysee</a> as primary platforms. From now on,
my YouTube exists to lead people to more healthy places.</p>
