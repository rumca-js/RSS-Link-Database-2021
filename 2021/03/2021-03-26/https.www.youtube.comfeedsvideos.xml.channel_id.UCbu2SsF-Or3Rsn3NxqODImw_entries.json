Pandemic? Politics? Bitcoin? Bots?!\n\nWhen the heck will we be able to get our graphics cards?\n\nFor a list of vendors to check or keep an eye on, check out this article: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-rtx-3090-3080-3070-buyers-guide-be-notified-when-theyre-in-stock/1100-6481694/\n\nGamers everywhere are chasing the hardware needed to run the best of their games, but graphics cards shortages have been around for nearly a year now. So why are GPUs so rare and expensive right now?\n\nUnfortunately there is more than one issue at play in the great hardware shortage of the 2020s. Covid-19 has meant that production and logistics have been slowed and the raw materials that go into chips and boards are much harder to come by, which has meant fewer GPUs for gamers trying to chase triple digits framerates in their FPS.\n\nThe Bitcoin miners and scalpers have also been a leading factor in the graphics card shortage, as many were using online bots to instantly purchase as many AMD or Nvidia GPUs as soon as stock was available.\n\nIt looks like the issues aren\u2019t going away any time soon though, with the global chip shortage currently reaching crisis point.\u00a0\n\nMake sure to keep your eye on GameSpot for any news about the GPU shortage or upcoming availability.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJR2OVYampk", "date_published": "2021-03-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Does Sony Care About Its Back Catalog? | Console Crew", "description": "Kurt Indovina joins the Console Crew to talk about the week that was for both Xbox and PlayStation, specifically in regards to Microsoft changing the name of Xbox Live and the reports that Sony will be shutting down the PS3, PSP, and PS Vita stores.\n\nThe Console Crew is back, with a new face temporarily joining its ranks. Kurt Indovina steps in to host the show while Lucy is away, joining Tamoor and Jordan to discuss the biggest console-related events of the week.\n\nThe trio start with a discussion about Xbox Live, which is now called Xbox network. The name change seems to precede plans that Microsoft has for transforming Xbox Live Gold, as Xbox Insiders are reporting that they've begun testing online multiplayer for free-to-play games, Looking 4 Groups, and party chat without the need to pay for them.\n\nFollowing all the Xbox talk, the group dives into a conversation about video game preservation, especially in the light of reports that Sony may be closing the online stores for PS3, PSP, and PS Vita. Tamoor gets a tad heated about it.\n\nConsole Crew is your weekly Friday roundup of the biggest news from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, hosted by Lucy James, Tamoor Hussain, and Jordan Ram\u00e9e.
