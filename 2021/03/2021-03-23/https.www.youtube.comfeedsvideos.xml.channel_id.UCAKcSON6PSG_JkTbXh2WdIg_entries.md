This week, Mary Lucia talks about "Finding Joseph I: The HR from Bad Brains Documentary."

"I'm still processing it in my head," Mary says, "because it's so incredible.

"If you don't know anything about Bad Brains," Mary contiunes, "they were possibly the most exciting live band ever. And HR, 'Human Rights,' was the most wildly enthusiastic, talented, amazing front person of the D.C. hardcore band called Bad Brains."

Watch more of what Mary has to say about this documentary in the video above. "Finding Joseph I: The HR from Bad Brains Documentary" is directed by James Lathos and is available for streaming on YouTube, Hulu and Amazon.

Five years ago today — on March 23, 2016 — Lucius visited our studio to perform songs from their second album, "Good Grief," which had been released just 12 days before.

The session was Lucius's third visit to The Current to date — and let's not forget their memorable Rock the Garden 2015 set. Not only had Lucius become friends of The Current by then, but host Mary Lucia said Minnesotans had even adopted Lucius as among their own. "It feels like home for us, for sure," Jess Wolfe of Lucius acknowledged. It was prescient comment, especially given that in March 2017, Lucius performed a MicroShow at no less a Minnesotan location than beneath the state capitol's rotunda.

Watch Lucius perform two songs from their 2016 studio set at The Current.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Born Again Teen"
3:45 "Dusty Trails"

## Donna Grantis   two songs at The Current 2019

On March 22, 2019, Donna Grantis visited The Current for a studio session. Three years after playing guitar with 3RDEYEGIRL and Prince, Grantis released her debut solo album, "Diamonds & Dynamite."

After Prince's death in 2016, Grantis spent time living in New York and Los Angeles before deciding to settle in Minneapolis and focus on her solo career. She found local bandmates to fit the project — Cody McKinney (bass), JT Bates (drums), Bryan Nichols (organ), and Suphala (tabla) — after "hanging out in Minneapolis for a couple months at First Avenue and Icehouse," Grantis said.

For the session at The Current, Grantis and crew brought their own lighting; they darkened the room, covered the windows, and flipped on blue LED bars. "It feels a little uncomfortable for me to play rock riffs in bright light," Grantis explained to host Mark Wheat with a laugh, later revealing that it was Prince who inspired her to reach beyond music and find ways to get creative with performance. Watch two songs from that session.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Mr. Majestic"
4:53 "Trashformer"

PERSONNEL
Donna Grantis – guitar
Cody McKinney – bass
JT Bates – drums
Bryan Nichols – organ
