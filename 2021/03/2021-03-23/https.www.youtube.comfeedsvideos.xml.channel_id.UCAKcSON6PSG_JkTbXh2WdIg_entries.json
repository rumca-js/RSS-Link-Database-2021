And HR, 'Human Rights,' was the most wildly enthusiastic, talented, amazing front person of the D.C. hardcore band called Bad Brains.\"\n\nWatch more of what Mary has to say about this documentary in the video above. \"Finding Joseph I: The HR from Bad Brains Documentary\" is directed by James Lathos and is available for streaming on YouTube, Hulu and Amazon.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#hr #badbrains", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7elY8R7k1o", "date_published": "2021-03-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Lucius   two songs at The Current 2016", "description": "Five years ago today \u2014 on March 23, 2016 \u2014 Lucius visited our studio to perform songs from their second album, \"Good Grief,\" which had been released just 12 days before.\n\nThe session was Lucius's third visit to The Current to date \u2014 and let's not forget their memorable Rock the Garden 2015 set. Not only had Lucius become friends of The Current by then, but host Mary Lucia said Minnesotans had even adopted Lucius as among their own. \"It feels like home for us, for sure,\" Jess Wolfe of Lucius acknowledged. It was prescient comment, especially given that in March 2017, Lucius performed a MicroShow at no less a Minnesotan location than beneath the state capitol's rotunda.\n\nWatch Lucius perform two songs from their 2016 studio set at The Current.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Born Again Teen\"\n3:45 \"Dusty Trails\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nHolly Laessig \u2013 vocals\nJess Wolfe \u2013 vocals\nAndrew Burri \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nPeter Lalish \u2013 guitar\nDan Molad \u2013 percussion, backing vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Anna Weggel\n\nFIND MORE:\n2013 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/10/24/lucius-perform-live-in-the-current-studios\n2014 session in the MPR Forum:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/02/28/lucius-perform-live-in-the-forum\n2015 Rock the Garden performance:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/06/30/lucius-live-at-rock-the-garden-2015\n2016 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/03/23/lucius-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2017 MicroShow in the Minnesota State Capitol rotunda: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/03/06/lucius-perform-intimate-microshow-for-the-current\n2019 concert at the Fitzgerald Theater:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/05/08/watch-lucius-fitzgerald-theater-live-nudes-tour\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n\n#lucius #ilovelucius", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W5lLXLxBBs", "date_published": "2021-03-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Donna Grantis   two songs at The Current 2019", "description": "On March 22, 2019, Donna Grantis visited The Current for a studio session. Three years after playing guitar with 3RDEYEGIRL and Prince, Grantis released her debut solo album, \"Diamonds & Dynamite.\"\n\nAfter Prince's death in 2016, Grantis spent time living in New York and Los Angeles before deciding to settle in Minneapolis and focus on her solo career. She found local bandmates to fit the project \u2014 Cody McKinney (bass), JT Bates (drums), Bryan Nichols (organ), and Suphala (tabla) \u2014 after \"hanging out in Minneapolis for a couple months at First Avenue and Icehouse,\" Grantis said.\n\nFor the session at The Current, Grantis and crew brought their own lighting; they darkened the room, covered the windows, and flipped on blue LED bars. \"It feels a little uncomfortable for me to play rock riffs in bright light,\" Grantis explained to host Mark Wheat with a laugh, later revealing that it was Prince who inspired her to reach beyond music and find ways to get creative with performance.
