Vaccine technique can be a rare cause of clots

https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=da&tl=en&u=https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2021-03-22-ssi-anbefaler-ny-vaccineteknik-efter-sjaeldne-blodpropper

State Serum Institute of Denmark, now recommends injection aspiration before injecting vaccine

This is a change in the recommendations

Based on a precautionary principle

Normally deltoid muscle does not have major vessels

Aspiration prolongs injection time so may be more painful

There is suspicion as to whether accidental injection of the vaccine into a blood vessel could play a role

No knowledge or data to support this suspicion

New recommendation only applies to covid vaccine

Intravascular administration may lead to a systemic inflammatory reaction leading to blood clots

Danish nursing council

Covid-19 vaccines should be given with aspiration before injection

https://sqd34kucpgoufz3qiuiswlotka--dsr-dk.translate.goog/politik-og-nyheder/nyhed/covid-19-vacciner-skal-gives-med-aspiration-foer-injektion

Aspiration is recommended for all approved covid-19 vaccines

Consistent with the Danish Health and Medicines Authority's guidelines

Vaccination personnel should ensure that they are injected correctly into a muscle and not into the bloodstream

Possible connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare but serious side effects with blood clots and bleeding

Danish doctor complains about the way the vaccinations are being given which he thinks is incorrect, because aspiration is not being done

When vaccinating, it is important to make sure that the vaccine does not go directly into the bloodstream. 

The plunger should be pulled back slightly, if blood comes in find a new place

Vaccines should not be given intravenously. 

It is not necessary to aspirate the syringe after the needle is introduced into the muscle (WHO, 2004; Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004).

AZD1222 US Phase III trial met primary efficacy endpoint in preventing COVID-19 at interim analysis

https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/astrazeneca-us-vaccine-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04516746?term=NCT04516746&draw=2&rank=1

Interim safety and efficacy analysis

N =  32,449

2:1 randomisation of vaccine to placebo

Accruing 141 symptomatic cases of COVID-19

Statistically significant vaccine efficacy of 79% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19

100% efficacy at preventing severe disease and hospitalisation

Vaccine efficacy was consistent across ethnicity and age

Aged 65 years and over, vaccine efficacy was 80%

The vaccine was well tolerated

Favourable reactogenicity and overall safety

Independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) identified no safety concerns

DSMB conducted a specific review of thrombotic events, as well as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 

(CVST) with the assistance of an independent neurologist

DSMB found no increased risk of thrombosis or events characterised by thrombosis, n = 21,583, receiving at least one dose of the vaccine

The specific search for CVST found no events in this trial

79% white/Caucasian

8% black/African American

4% native American 

4% Asian

22% of participants were Hispanic.

Two doses administered, four week interval

Extended interval of up to 12 weeks demonstrated greater efficacy

Supported by immunogenicity data

This evidence suggests administration of the second dose with an interval 

Longer interval could further increase efficacy

and accelerates the number of people who can receive their first dose

Stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions 

2-8 degrees Celsius or 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit, for at least six months

Counter argument

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/niaid-statement-astrazeneca-vaccine

Concerned by information released by AstraZeneca on initial data from its COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. 

AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data. 

Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to decide.

After thorough review of the data by independent advisory committees
