A collection of 11 tracks from AMJ & TBB (Juha-Matti & Tero Hilpinen).

In the track listing below, [B]righter and [D]arker tells the chips used for recording. Almost 50/50 here. I've learned to like the less-in-your-face (subdued) bassline from the darker chips, even if it means some trade-offs in other areas. Don't like it? I'm sure there are plenty of other uploads on Youtube with brighter signature.
