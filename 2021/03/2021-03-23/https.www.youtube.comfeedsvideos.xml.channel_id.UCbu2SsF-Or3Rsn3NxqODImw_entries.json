Seeing as this is the first game since the N64 days, this will be the first Pokemon Snap game in HD and it will include Pokemon that didn't even exist back during Gen 1; however, the full roster of Pokemon in this new game has not been revealed yet.\n\nIn the preview session we attended, we got to see gameplay of the Blushing Beach area and spotted a few details not previously mentioned in trailers. This includes a brand new scan feature, the button placement, the new night version of areas, the fact that the game is still on rails, and how you're still transported back to the lab at the end. Other details we already learned from previous trailers include how your overarching goal is to discover the mystery of the Luminous Pokemon and how you can share your photos online with a Nintendo Switch Online Membership.\n\nNew Pokemon Snap will be released exclusively for Nintendo Switch on April 30. The Pokemon Company also announced that remakes of Pokemon Diamond & Pearl, titled Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, will be released for the Nintendo Switch in late 2021, and that Pokemon Legends: Arceus, a brand-new action role-playing game set in the Pokemon universe, will be released in early 2022.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Rf1JbexQw", "date_published": "2021-03-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Best Fortnite Clips of the Week", "description": "Join Persia for a round-up of the week's best Fortnite community clips.

From the gruesome and gory phases of William Birkin's transformations in the Resident Evil 2 Remake to the iconic Uroboros-fueled transformation of Albert Wesker in Resident Evil 5, Persia covers a variety of titles from the legendary series as we celebrate its 25th anniversary this year. \n\nFor more Resident Evil news, breakdowns, and round-ups, be sure to visit our channel!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DFqCbmrRiw", "date_published": "2021-03-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Magic: Legends Open Beta Launch Trailer", "description": "Check out the official open beta launch trailer for Magic: Legends!

Maybe it's because BioWare has finally confirmed that they're working on the next instalment in the franchise, or maybe it's because the remaster of the beloved trilogy is right around the corner. In any case, Lucy has Mass Effect on the brain.\n\nWhile waiting for the Legendary Edition, she's gone back to playing Mass Effect Andromeda and has made a list of things that the next Mass Effect could take from both the original trilogy, as well as Andromeda, as well as changes she'd love to see BioWare make with their sci-fi epic. From where in the timeline the story will take place (hopefully as a sequel to Andromeda and the trilogy) as well as which characters we should definitely leave behind (cough, Shepard), it's an exhaustive list of Mass Effect goodness. She covers characters, gameplay changes, and even broaches the subject of day one DLC.\n\nIf you're a Mass Effect fan, make sure to head over to youtube.com/GameSpot, where we'll have loads more Mass Effect videos coming out in the weeks leading up to the release of Mass Effect Legendary Edition on May 14.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLIkAmaoQDo", "date_published": "2021-03-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
