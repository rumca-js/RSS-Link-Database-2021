New Pokémon Snap is only a month away from release and ahead of launch we attended a preview session where we saw new gameplay and learned more details about the upcoming game.

It's been 22 years since the first Pokemon Snap released for the Nintendo 64 in 1999, and we're finally getting a sequel on Nintendo Switch titled New Pokemon Snap. Seeing as this is the first game since the N64 days, this will be the first Pokemon Snap game in HD and it will include Pokemon that didn't even exist back during Gen 1; however, the full roster of Pokemon in this new game has not been revealed yet.

In the preview session we attended, we got to see gameplay of the Blushing Beach area and spotted a few details not previously mentioned in trailers. This includes a brand new scan feature, the button placement, the new night version of areas, the fact that the game is still on rails, and how you're still transported back to the lab at the end. Other details we already learned from previous trailers include how your overarching goal is to discover the mystery of the Luminous Pokemon and how you can share your photos online with a Nintendo Switch Online Membership.

New Pokemon Snap will be released exclusively for Nintendo Switch on April 30. The Pokemon Company also announced that remakes of Pokemon Diamond & Pearl, titled Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, will be released for the Nintendo Switch in late 2021, and that Pokemon Legends: Arceus, a brand-new action role-playing game set in the Pokemon universe, will be released in early 2022.
