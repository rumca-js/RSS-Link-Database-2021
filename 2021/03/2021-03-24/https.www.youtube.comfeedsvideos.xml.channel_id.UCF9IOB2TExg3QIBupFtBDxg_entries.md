Vaccine technique can be a rare cause of clots

https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=da&tl=en&u=https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2021-03-22-ssi-anbefaler-ny-vaccineteknik-efter-sjaeldne-blodpropper

State Serum Institute of Denmark, now recommends injection aspiration before injecting vaccine

This is a change in the recommendations

Based on a precautionary principle

Normally deltoid muscle does not have major vessels

Aspiration prolongs injection time so may be more painful

There is suspicion as to whether accidental injection of the vaccine into a blood vessel could play a role

No knowledge or data to support this suspicion

New recommendation only applies to covid vaccine

Intravascular administration may lead to a systemic inflammatory reaction leading to blood clots

Danish nursing council

Covid-19 vaccines should be given with aspiration before injection

https://sqd34kucpgoufz3qiuiswlotka--dsr-dk.translate.goog/politik-og-nyheder/nyhed/covid-19-vacciner-skal-gives-med-aspiration-foer-injektion

Aspiration is recommended for all approved covid-19 vaccines

Consistent with the Danish Health and Medicines Authority's guidelines

Vaccination personnel should ensure that they are injected correctly into a muscle and not into the bloodstream

Possible connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare but serious side effects with blood clots and bleeding

Danish doctor complains about the way the vaccinations are being given which he thinks is incorrect, because aspiration is not being done

When vaccinating, it is important to make sure that the vaccine does not go directly into the bloodstream. 

The plunger should be pulled back slightly, if blood comes in find a new place

Vaccines should not be given intravenously. 

It is not necessary to aspirate the syringe after the needle is introduced into the muscle (WHO, 2004; Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004).
