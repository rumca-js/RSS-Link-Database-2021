We celebrate Tolkien Reading Day by looking at the entire life of Faramir - the character which Tolkien once said was most like himself. We cover his life growing up alongside his brother Boromir, rejecting The One Ring, marrying Éowyn, and his later life as Steward of Gondor under King Aragorn. The life of Faramir stands as a testament to the value of wisdom, empathy, and love.
