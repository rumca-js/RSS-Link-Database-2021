Not only had Lucius become friends of The Current by then, but host Mary Lucia said Minnesotans had even adopted Lucius as among their own. \"It feels like home for us, for sure,\" Jess Wolfe of Lucius acknowledged. It was prescient comment, especially given that in March 2017, Lucius performed a MicroShow at no less a Minnesotan location than beneath the state capitol's rotunda.\n\nWatch Lucius perform two songs from their 2016 studio set at The Current.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Born Again Teen\"\n3:45 \"Dusty Trails\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nHolly Laessig \u2013 vocals\nJess Wolfe \u2013 vocals\nAndrew Burri \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nPeter Lalish \u2013 guitar\nDan Molad \u2013 percussion, backing vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Anna Weggel\n\nFIND MORE:\n2013 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/10/24/lucius-perform-live-in-the-current-studios\n2014 session in the MPR Forum:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/02/28/lucius-perform-live-in-the-forum\n2015 Rock the Garden performance:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/06/30/lucius-live-at-rock-the-garden-2015\n2016 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/03/23/lucius-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2017 MicroShow in the Minnesota State Capitol rotunda: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/03/06/lucius-perform-intimate-microshow-for-the-current\n2019 concert at the Fitzgerald Theater:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/05/08/watch-lucius-fitzgerald-theater-live-nudes-tour\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n\n#lucius #ilovelucius", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W5lLXLxBBs", "date_published": "2021-03-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
