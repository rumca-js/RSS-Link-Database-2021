Call Of Duty is building up to Season 3 and continues to leave Modern Warfare players behind. It’s time to look at what Call Of Duty players don’t understand about each other and if Activision can ever break from the yearly cycle. 

Call Of Duty continues its yearly cycle, and the changes that cycle institutes to Warzone have left the Modern Warfare and Cold War audiences in different worlds. Ever since Cold War took over the Season Pass, store, and events in Warzone, Modern Warfare players have felt left behind. Meanwhile, Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has gathered a classic Call Of Duty fan base looking for an entirely different arcade experience. In this video, we are going to look at the Modern Warfare versus Cold War players, how they are feeling about the state of Call Of Duty, and what each audience is looking for. Important topics we’re going to cover are why Modern Warfare fans feel robbed of Season 7 and missing weapons, what Cold War fans know about Call Of Duty that many new players don’t, and if Modern Warfare is a true Call Of Duty game. 

We’ll also explore how the conflict between Call Of Duty audiences largely comes down to Activision’s yearly release cycle and how that might no longer make sense with titles from Treyarch, Infinity Ward, Raven Software, and Sledgehammer Games being so different, yet all having to tie into Warzone. Finally, we’re going to go back to your response to the rumor that the next Call Of Duty game might go back to World War II. 

We’re expecting more Call Of Duty announcements this spring, including what the rumored WW2 Vanguard game might be. Call Of Duty: Warzone is building up to Season 3, invading the map with zombies, and possibly building up to a nuke event. Make sure to keep coming back to GameSpot’s YouTube page for ongoing news, release dates, and events around Call Of Duty.

Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the insane weaponry of Splatoon 2, including the iconic Splattershot, the brutal Splat Roller, and the rapid-fire Hero Shot--a weapon that has a striking resemblance to the FN P90.

Splatoon 2 is Nintendo’s answer to the online multiplayer shooter and offers up a huge arsenal of weapons for players to wrap their tentacles around.

In the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of Splatoon 2, and compares them to their real-life counterparts.
