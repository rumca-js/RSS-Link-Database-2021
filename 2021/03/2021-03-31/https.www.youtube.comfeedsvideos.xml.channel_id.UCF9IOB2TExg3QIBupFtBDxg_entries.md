The main thing we're concerned about is the risk of importing into the UK variants which could have a reduced effectiveness of the vaccines we're currently using

They did absolutely nothing to even consider the possibility of an accidental leak

And it's outrageous that they would insert that it's highly unlikely when they didn't even bother to look into it

What they said is that they were given the task of examining the zoonotic origin of the pandemic

So in the framing of the task, a conclusion was already implicit

most likely that Covid-19 accidentally leaked from a lab

Robert Redfield, doctor, virologist, former CDC director

I am of the point of view that I still think the most likely etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was from a laboratory, you know, escaped

Now, other people don't believe that, that's fine.

Science will eventually figure it out. 

It's not unusual for respiratory pathogens that are being worked on in the laboratory to infect the laboratory worker

I do not believe this somehow came from a bat to a human. 

And at that moment in time, the virus came to the human, became one of the most infectious viruses that we know in humanity for human to human transmission. 

Normally, when a pathogen goes from a zoonotic to human, it takes a while for it to figure out how to become more and more efficient

Not a proven fact, I'm allowed to have opinions now

Believes the virus began spreading, perhaps since September or October

Global settlement for next pandemic 

World War Two style deal

Build cross-border cooperation

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

At that time, following the devastation of two world wars, political leaders came together to forge the multilateral system

The aims were clear: To bring countries together, to dispel the temptations of isolationism and nationalism, and to address the challenges that could only be achieved together in the spirit of solidarity and co-operation - namely peace, prosperity, health and security

Leaders

Countries be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly co-ordinated fashion

Systems for alerting people about potential pandemics

Improving the sharing of data

Dr David Nabarro

Without some kind of special action, the world as a whole will not be vaccinated until well into 2022

During that time all sorts of problems with variants will emerge

WHO's Covid report, detailed considered appraisal.

https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus

The mission

Joint international team, 17 Chinese and 17 international experts

14 January to 10 February 2021 in Wuhan

Prevent reinfection, animals and humans

Prevent establishment of new zoonotic reservoirs, mink, cats

Timeline

Outbreak may have started sometime in the months before the middle of December 2019

(Based on molecular sequence data)

Circulation of SARS-CoV-2 preceded the initial detection of cases by several weeks.

Virus transmission widespread in Wuhan by the first week of 2020

Epidemic in Wuhan preceded the spread in the rest of Hubei Province

174 COVID-19 cases with onset of symptoms in December 2019

8th December 2019, first official case

76,000 ‘cases’ from October and November unlikely

 Genomics

Huanan market, at the point of its closing, 923 environmental samples, 73 samples were positive

Widespread contamination of surfaces with SARS-CoV-2

Huanan market cluster had identical virus genomes

Other genomes were also discovered from December / January

Upstream suppliers to the Huanan market taken during 2020, no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in animals

Initial cases associated with Huanan market, other markets and no markets

Coronaviruses most highly related to SARS-CoV-2 found in bats and pangolins

None sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 to serve as its direct progenitor

Sampling before and after the outbreak

80 000 wildlife, livestock and poultry samples collected, 31 provinces in China

No positive result for SARS-CoV-2 antibody or nucleic acid

Cold chains

Cold chain products, not tested at the time

Confirmed international transmission in cold chains

Four conclusions

Qualitative risk assessment

Direct zoonotic spillover is considered to be a possible-to-likely pathway

Introduction through an intermediate host is considered to be a likely to very likely pathway

Introduction through cold/ food chain products is considered a possible pathway

Introduction through a laboratory incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway 

Next phase

Widespread testing of domestic and wild animals 

Rhinolophus bats, southern provinces of China, countries around East Asia, South-East Asia and any other regions

More cold chain analysis

Positive results in sewage, serum, human or animal tissues/swab and other SARS-CoV-2 test by the end of 2019

US, UK, Australia, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Republic of Korea, Slovenia, Statement

It is equally essential that we voice our shared concerns

that the international expert study on the source of the Sars-Cov-2 virus was significantly delayed

and lacked access to complete, original data and samples

While regretting the late start of the study, the delayed deployment of the experts and the limited availability of early samples and related data, 

we consider the work carried out to date and the report released today as a helpful first step

EU statement also called on all relevant authorities to help with the next stages

So that any gaps in data needed to further the investigation can be addressed

Called for timely access for independent experts early in future pandemics

Access to China after months of fraught negotiations

No space for this section in YT comments, descriptions are of limited length.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

In my discussions with the team, they expressed the difficulties they encountered in accessing raw data

I expect future collaborative studies to include more timely and comprehensive data sharing

Scientists would benefit from full access to data including biological samples from at least September 2019

I concur with the team’s conclusion that farmers, suppliers and their contacts will need to be interviewed

Team also visited several laboratories in Wuhan and considered the possibility that the virus entered the human population as a result of a laboratory incident.

However, I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough. 

Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions.

Let me say clearly that as far as WHO is concerned all hypotheses remain on the table.

Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy

This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end.
