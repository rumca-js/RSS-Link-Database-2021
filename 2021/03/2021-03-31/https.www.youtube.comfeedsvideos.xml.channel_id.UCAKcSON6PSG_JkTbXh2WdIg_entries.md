Mary Lucia talks about a documentary she recently watched about the band Pulp, and the farewell concert they gave in their hometown of Sheffield, England. The film is called "Pulp: a Film about Life, Death and Supermarkets," and it is directed by Florian Habicht.

Pulp are well known for their song, "Common People," and in this documentary, a lot of time is spent interview everyday folks around Sheffield. "I don't even know that it's so much a movie about Pulp," Mary says, "but it might be a movie about common people: what unites us, what brings us together, what we love: Music."

Watch more of what Mary has to say about this documentary, which is streaming now on Amazon Prime Video.
