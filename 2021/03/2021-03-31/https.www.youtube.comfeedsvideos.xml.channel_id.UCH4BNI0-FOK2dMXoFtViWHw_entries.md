The finest burritos in the world are made in San Francisco’s Mission District. But how can you get a hot & fresh one in New York City in time for lunch? Physics, that’s how. For this very serious and scientific video, we dug a classic documentary out of the vault that tells the story of the transcontinental burrito tunnel, and its successor, the transcontinental burrito hypertunnel. They are both true marvels of physics. Oh, and they aren’t real… but the science is.
