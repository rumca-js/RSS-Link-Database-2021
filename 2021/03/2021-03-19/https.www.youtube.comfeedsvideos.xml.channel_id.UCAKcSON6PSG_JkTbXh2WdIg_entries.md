## Grant Hart - two songs at The Current (2013)

March 18 is the birthdate of the late Grant Hart. A Minnesota musician, Hart is best known for his time as the drummer and co-songwriter of the band Hüsker Dü, but many may not know that Hart's solo career, which began in 1988, lasted far longer than Hüsker Dü.

Following the dissolution of Hüsker Dü, Hart vacillated between prolific creative output or absence from the public eye. In 2013, Hart released a concept album, "The Argument," that was based on an unpublished work of the late William S. Burroughs, who had adapted John Milton's epic poem "Paradise Lost" for the stage. Given those source materials, it's no surprise that "The Argument" is a stylistically ambitious album. "I've always been attracted to the [Milton] line, 'Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n," Hart told NPR in 2013. "There's a revolutionary in me that really loves that kind of thinking."

In 2013, Hart visited The Current studio for a session that aired on The Local Show, which at that time was hosted by David Campbell. Hart played a couple songs from "The Argument"; watch those performances above.
