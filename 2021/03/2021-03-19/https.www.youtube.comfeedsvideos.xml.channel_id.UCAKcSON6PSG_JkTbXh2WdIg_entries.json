A Minnesota musician, Hart is best known for his time as the drummer and co-songwriter of the band H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, but many may not know that Hart's solo career, which began in 1988, lasted far longer than H\u00fcsker D\u00fc.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Hart vacillated between prolific creative output or absence from the public eye. In 2013, Hart released a concept album, \"The Argument,\" that was based on an unpublished work of the late William S. Burroughs, who had adapted John Milton's epic poem \"Paradise Lost\" for the stage. Given those source materials, it's no surprise that \"The Argument\" is a stylistically ambitious album. \"I've always been attracted to the [Milton] line, 'Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n,\" Hart told NPR in 2013. \"There's a revolutionary in me that really loves that kind of thinking.\"\n\nIn 2013, Hart visited The Current studio for a session that aired on The Local Show, which at that time was hosted by David Campbell. Hart played a couple songs from \"The Argument\"; watch those performances above.\n\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Awake, Arise\"\n4:15 \"Is The Sky The Limit?\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nGrant Hart \u2013 vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: David Campbell; Jon Schober\n\nFIND MORE:\n2013 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/07/16/grant-hart-live\n2013 NPR interview: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/07/22/grant-hart-interivew\n2017 obituary:\nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2017/09/songwriter-and-husker-du-founder-grant-hart-passes-away-at-56/\n2017 posthumously published interview with Andrea Swensson:\nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2017/11/the-story-of-husker-dus-beginnings-as-told-by-grant-hart/\n2017 Yanomamos project:\nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2017/12/yanomamos-trio-featuring-grant-hart-on-drums-issue-second-release-after-29-year-gap/\n\"Do You Remember?\" documentary podcast about H\u00fcsker D\u00fc:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/collection/husker-du/ \n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxFMUVnOrO8", "date_published": "2021-03-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Jon Batiste - Virtual Session", "description": "Jon Batiste joins The Current for a virtual session, hear a few recent songs plus a conversation with Sean McPherson about the influence of New Orleans on his music, setting his intentions with Stevie Wonder, and recording music outside of a traditional studio environment.\n\nThis session was previously recorded in front of a live virtual audience of Minnesota Public Radio members.
