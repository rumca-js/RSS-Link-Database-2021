-----------------------
The world of NFT’s today has some stark similarities to the Dot Com Bubble of the 90’s to early 2000’s. So the real question is, is this a bubble?
The short answer? Yes

Speculators are dumping money into anything that is an NFT for the sake of it being an NFT - just like how speculators were throwing money at anything with a dot com in its name, hoping that it’s gonna go up
Now some of these NFT’s do have the potential to become actual collectibles that go up in price. But real collectibles like trading cards never start out at a high price
They start low and gradually go up over time.

When you look at the buyers of these expensive NFT’s - what do you find?
Most were early crypto investors that are sitting on massive gains that they have no idea what to do with. So instead of cashing out and having to pay the tax man, they transfer some of their wealth into these NFT’s.

So yes, this space is probably in a bubble right now.
But then the question becomes, is it going to pop? And if it does pop, are NFT’s here to stay? Do NFT’s even offer any value that would make it last? Or is it just a passing trend?

At first, the idea of paying money for a jpg or video sounds crazy
Yet… we’re also the type of creatures to pay sometimes an equally crazy amount of money on consumerism

Why do we buy all these irrational things? Because of one simple thing: status. We’re social creatures - we want others to know that we have good tastes, that we’re high class - socially relevant.

NFT’s for art and collectibles can actually have a lot of merit. Think about the Beeple collage that just sold for $69.3 million dollars. It’s a culturally relevant artist that millennials and Gen Z love. An NFT art piece that happened to take Beeple 13 years of blood, sweat, and tears to make

Sure you can download it off his website? But you and I both know that it’s just not the same - that it’s not authentic

There are also a ton of other value-adds NFT’s offer to artists

Another idea for NFT’s is allowing creators, YouTubers, influencers, to basically issue stock through an IPO - here’s how it could work
