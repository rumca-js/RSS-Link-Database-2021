So my hands are tied and I must review it! This VR version is not on steam currently by the way, it is only on PSVR.\n\nSo I must dust off my totally not useless PS4 and buy a PSVR which apparently doesn\u2019t even come with wireless controllers even though it\u2019s a VR console! Anyway...\n\nWhen I heard Hitman 2 was getting a VR version I actually thought they meant Silent Assassin because I am an idiot. All 3 of this new trilogy can be played in VR using the PS4 and PSVR but I only played and reviewed Hitman 3 VR for this video.\n\nOverall Hitman 3 is a good but slightly pricey game, Hitman 3 PSVR I would say is a bad game that comes free with it. So Hitman VR it\u2019s definitely worth trying, but it won\u2019t knock your socks off. \n\nI may move away from VR for a while after this review, my hopes are to do Fallout Is A Nightmare but cover all of those games.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/UpIsNotJump\nMerch: https://www.pixelempire.com/pages/upisnotjump\nTwittz: https://twitter.com/UpIsNotJump\n\nSuper special thanks to my members!\nBioGeek\nSuperhero3807\nGreenCoatGaming\nBunbun\nClementine\nSuperhero3807\nDylan Kenny\nQuietAlice\nDyllan Meacham\nSAMEJINX\nGoxid\nAli Khan\nDonald Callahan\nGisca\nDeadeth\nFlame Soulis\nCoat Hook\nlordofthesea 3\nCaptainFlowers\nBio Geek\nJohn Engelhardt\nPfnoll\nDJJax\nEllana Rose Thornton-Wheybrew\nMikeTheSpike\nhamsterking5\nJacob Rodriguez\nGreenCoatGaming\nrandandy31\nkennedy kempton\nAnders Rokke\nDaniel S\u00e1nchez Su\u00e1rez\nSarah Luczyk\nASSISTJORDAN\nWiseman Labs\nAndrew Harrison\nKaleb Jacobsen\nSpectere\nTroubleshoot Fox\nWhiteDragonTC\nsteven Dielissen", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP8g04bUWB0", "date_published": "2021-03-19 22:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
