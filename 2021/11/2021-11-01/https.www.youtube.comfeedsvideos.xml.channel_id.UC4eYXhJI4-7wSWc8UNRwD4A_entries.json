Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nMaia Stern | November 1, 2021\nIn their Tiny Desk (home) concert, The War On Drugs gather in their packed studio in Burbank, CA to let us in on the fun and intricate inner workings of their craft. After opening the show with \u201cI Don\u2019t Live Here Anymore,\u201d which shares the same title as their new album, frontman Adam Granduciel introduces the band and asks if anybody has a capo. Suddenly a very thoughtfully crafted tiny desk with drumsticks for legs (and topped with a tiny lamp too!) slowly lowers down into the space, delivering said capo. Granduciel smiles, and the group continues with three more tracks from the new record: \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Wait,\u201d \u201cOld Skin,\u201d and \u201cChange.\u201d \n\nAlthough the band\u2019s big sound is fit to fill an arena, we\u2019re lucky to get to hear it reverberating in this cozy setting. The War On Drugs\u2019 fifth album, released Oct. 29, presents new songs that feel familiar and true to their sound. Originally based in Philadelphia, PA, the band\u2019s members are now spread out across the country, but they came together to jam, demo, and ultimately record this album as a kindred unit. \n\nThe new songs are about reconnection, change, and uncertainty. This line from the title track resonates with me in the context of the daily unknown the pandemic has brought: \u201cTime surrounds me like an ocean / My memories like waves / Is life just dying in slow motion / Or getting stronger everyday.\u201d There\u2019s beautiful tension and a lot of joy in these classic ballads.\n\nSET LIST\n\"I Don't Live Here Anymore\"\n\"I Don't Wanna Wait\"\n\"Old Skin\"\n\"Change\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAdam Granduciel: vocals, guitar\nDave Hartley: bass, backing vocals\nCharlie Hall: drums\nAnthony LaMarca: guitar, backing vocals\nRobbie Bennett: keyboards\nJon Natchez: saxaphone, keyboards\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Cody William Smith, Danny Garfield\nAudio: Austin Asvanonda\nDirector: Cody William Smith\nEditor: Danny Garfield\nAudio Mixing: Austin Asvanonda\nCamera Operators: Paolo Arriola and Keith Pratt\nGaffer: Christopher Oh\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Maia Stern\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #thewarondrugs", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKJ5JyuP7WY", "date_published": "2021-11-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
