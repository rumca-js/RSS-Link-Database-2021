In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Nintendo's Switch Online Expansion Pack trailer becoming it's most disliked video ever, leaked details about 2022's Call of Duty, the reason Roblox suffered a long outage, and why Fortnite may not see an official release in China.

DeVante also talks about new leaked details about 2022's Call of Duty game. The game could have a morality system like Red Dead Redemption 2, and the campaign will apparently feature a new level of gore for the series. As reported previously, 2022's game is rumored to be a sequel to 2019's Modern Warfare from Infinity Ward, focusing on Colombian drug cartels.

Later in the video, Roblox Corp. CEO David Baszucki explains the game's weekend long outage. And China will reportedly not be getting an official release of Fortnite following two years of testing.
