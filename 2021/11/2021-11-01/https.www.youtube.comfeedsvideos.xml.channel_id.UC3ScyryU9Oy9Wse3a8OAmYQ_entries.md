Why would four innocent men confess to a brutal crime they didn’t commit? FRONTLINE goes inside the saga of the Norfolk Four. (Aired 2010)

FRONTLINE producer Ofra Bikel (“Innocence Lost,” “An Ordinary Crime”) investigates the conviction of four U.S. Navy sailors for the rape and murder of a Norfolk, Virginia, woman in 1997. In interviews with the sailors, Bikel learns of some of the high-pressure police interrogation techniques, including the threat of the death penalty, sleep deprivation and intimidation, that led each of the “Norfolk Four” to confess, despite the lack of any evidence linking them to the crime.
