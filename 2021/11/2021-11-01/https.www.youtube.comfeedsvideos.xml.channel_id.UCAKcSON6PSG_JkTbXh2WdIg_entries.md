Eight years ago — November 1, 2013 — the band Okkervil River visited The Current studio for a session in support of "The Silver Gymnasium," their album from that year. Almost five years later, Okkervil River were back for another session, that time playing songs from their 2018 album, "In The Rainbow Rain." 

Although based in Austin, Texas, Okkervil River have always enjoyed a little bit of a local connection thanks to frontman Will Sheff's 1998 graduation from Macalester College right here in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Watch two songs by Okkervil River, recorded in The Current studio in 2013 and 2018.
