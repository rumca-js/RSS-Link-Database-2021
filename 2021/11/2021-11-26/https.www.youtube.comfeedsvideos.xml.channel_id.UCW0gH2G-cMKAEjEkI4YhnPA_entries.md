The Black Númenóreans were survivors of their fallen realm who were loyal to - and worshipped - Sauron.  Among them are three Ringwraiths, the Mouth of Sauron, and Queen Berúthiel of Gondor.  They were descended from the King's Men, the large group of Númenóreans who turned their backs upon the Valor and Elder.

The Mouth of Sauron would become a lieutenant and emissary of Sauron, the Ringwraiths among his most trusted servants, and Queen Berúthiel would be among the most mysterious rulers of Men ever.  It is said her 10 cats were used to spy on her behalf - and that she could communicate with them and even read their memories.
