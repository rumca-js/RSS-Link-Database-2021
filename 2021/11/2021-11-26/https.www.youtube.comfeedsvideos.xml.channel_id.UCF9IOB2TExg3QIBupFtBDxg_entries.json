We know that a young woman arrived from Egypt who had flown via Turkey into Belgium landing on the 11th of November.\n\nWe also we also know that she became symptomatic and tested positive for the omicron variant on the 22nd of November.\n\nIt is possible that this young woman had a long incubation period of 11 days or more, but this is somewhat improbable.\n\nThis clearly leaves open the possibility that she contracted the virus within Belgium, between the 11th and 22nd of November.\n\nIt is therefore within the bounds of possibility that she originally contracted this virus in Egypt, or on the flight from Egypt to Turkey, or the flight from Turkey to Belgium, or in Belgium.\n\nThis is what we know so far and of course it is important not to over extrapolate from the facts at our disposal.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abMDdJojnqc", "date_published": "2021-11-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "The O variant", "description": "Worst ever Covid variant?
