It is an extraordinary piece of literature, social critique and satire of the Russian nihilist movement as well as a novel with deep psychological insights on the nature of man.\n\nDostoevsky\u2019s most sustained and spirited attack on the Russian nihilist movement is voiced by one of the darkest, least sympathetic of all his characters \u2013 the nameless narrator and protagonist known as the Underground Man, revealing the hopeless dilemmas in which he lands as a result.\n\nNotes from Underground attempts to warn people of several ideas that were gaining ground in the 1860s including: moral and political nihilism, rational egoism, determinism, utilitarianism, utopianism, atheism and what would become communism. \n\n\u2b50 Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\n\ud83d\udcfa YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n\ud83d\uded2 Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n\u2615 Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\n\ud83d\udcd8 PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\n\ud83c\udfa6 Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\n\ud83d\udce8 Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\n\ud83d\udcda My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\ud83c\udfa8 Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/11/27/the-underground-man-dostoevsky\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\n\ud83d\udcda Recommended Reading \n\n\u25b6 Notes from Underground (1864)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DBRXas\n\u25b6 Crime and Punishment (1866)\nhttps://amzn.to/3h2BIks\n\u25b6 The Idiot (1869)\nhttps://amzn.to/3bxKFRK\n\u25b6 Demons (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/2FexadH\n\u25b6 The Brothers Karamazov (1880)\nhttps://amzn.to/324Kiem\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Prefer Audiobooks?
