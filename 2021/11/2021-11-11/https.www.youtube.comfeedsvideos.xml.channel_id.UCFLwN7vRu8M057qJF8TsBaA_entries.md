So this week I visited a cat shelter to volunteer and to spread some information about adopting cats. Although the tips I share here can be spread to getting most pets, not just cats.

I doubt I was much assistance at the cat shelter, it was likely I caused more work than saved, but everyone at Cat’s Protection were LOVELY.
Early in December the Fallout 3 video will be finished too, so (monster voice) YOU HAVEN’T HEARD THE LAST FROM ME
