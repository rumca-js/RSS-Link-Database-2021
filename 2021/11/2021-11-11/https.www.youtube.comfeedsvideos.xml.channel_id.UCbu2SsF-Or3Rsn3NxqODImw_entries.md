In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Battlefield 2042 launching with no scoreboard or in-game chat, Battlefield 2042 Portal servers being reset to "combat bad behavior", GTA Trilogy getting Pulled For PC and Sony revealing the most popular PS5 games. 

In this video, DeVante talks about Battlefield 2042 launching with missing features like no scoreboard or in-game chat. ICE plans to add voice chat to Battlefield 2042 in an official capacity after launch, and potentially as soon as "day 25" after release, which would be sometime in December. Also the "effectiveness" of XP farming servers in Portal mode has been reduced thanks to a new update. The development team also performed a hard reset of all Portal mode servers in order to free up more servers in the mode as well.

DeVante also talks about the GTA Trilogy getting pulled from PC and the Rockstar Games Launcher going down. Because GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas were de-listed on digital stores ahead of the Definitive Edition's release, there is currently no way to buy the games in any fashion on PC right now.

Later in the video, Sony reveals most popular PS5 games on console's first birthday.

Elden Ring is the latest FromSoftware game from now-legendary Game Director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator of Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. Elden Ring is Hidetaka Miyazaki's take on an open world, and many have called it Open World Dark Souls, thanks to how similar it is to Dark Souls' roots.

## The Bee That Broke Skyrim

Skyrim's intro is iconic, but the classic opening-turned-meme almost didn't happen due to a bug in the game--to be more specific, a bee.

Skyrim's opening cart scene has become iconic since the game's release ten years ago, but it nearly didn't happen due to a bug that derailed the whole thing… quite literally. 

In this video, Kurt Indovina chats with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim senior world artist Nate Purkeypile about the bee that broke the game's classic intro. In the decade since its release, Skyrim's opening has become synonymous with the meme which spawned "Hey you, you're finally awake.'' For a lot of players, seeing the intro means a new journey through Northern Tamriel awaits, but for Purkeypile, seeing the intro again is a bit of a touchy subject. 

Purkeypile breaks down the story of the mysterious bug that plagued the game's opening cart scene, and the many layers it took to unravel to find the bug and fix it. With Purkeypile, Kurt helps carry the story along, while regaling his own passion for Bethesda's epic fantasy RPG.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition comes out on November 11 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with next-gen upgrades for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

In this video we grabbed gameplay highlights of our time playing the classic modes on several original maps including Caspian Border, and Battle of the Bulge.
