Two years ago today — Nov. 10, 2019 — a session that Tyler Childers recorded in The Current studio featured on United States of Americana with Bill DeVille.

At the time, Childers' latest album, "Country Squire," had debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top Country Albums and American/Folk Albums charts. "I was pretty proud of it, man, and it meant a lot," Childers said of the debut. "I put a lot of time and a lot of effort into it, and for people to take a liking to it and put it there, that was really cool."

Watch two performances by Childers and his band from that 2019 session. And roots music lovers: keep your ears peeled for a "Wildwood Flower" quotation that Childers slips seamlessly into the outro of "Lady May." 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Feathered Indians"
3:41 "Lady May"

PERSONNEL
Tyler Childers - vocals, guitar
Jesse Wells - guitar, fiddle
Rodney Elkins - drums, backing vocals
Loren Chase Lewis - keyboards
Craig Burletic - bass
James Barker - pedal steel
