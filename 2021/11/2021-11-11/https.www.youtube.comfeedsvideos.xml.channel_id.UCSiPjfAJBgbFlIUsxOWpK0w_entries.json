Am I too flirty?\nDo I like what you like?\n\nI could be wholesome, I could be loathsome\nI guess I'm a little bit shy\nWhy don't you like me, why don't you like me\nWithout making me try?\n\nI tried to be like Grace Kelly\nBut all her looks were too sad\nSo I tried a little Freddie\nI've gone identity mad!\n\nI could be brown, I could be blue\nI could be violet sky\nI could be hurtful, could be purple\nI could be anything you like\nGotta be green, gotta be mean\nGotta be everything more\nWhy don't you like me? Don't you like me?\nWalk out the door!\n\nHow can I help it, how can I help \nHow can I help what you think?\nHello my baby, hello my baby\nPutting my life on the brink\n\nWhy don't you like me, why don't you like me\nWhy don't you like yourself?\nShould I bend over? Should I look older\nTo be put on your shelf?\n\nI tried to be like Grace Kelly\nBut all her looks were too sad\nSo I tried a little Freddie\nI've gone identity mad!\n\nI could be brown, I could be blue\nI could be violet sky\nCould be hurtful, could be purple\nI could be anything you like\nGotta be green, gotta be mean\nGotta be everything more\nWhy don't you like me? Don't you like me?\nWalk out the door!\n\nI could be brown, I could be blue\nI could be violet sky\nI could be hurtful, could be purple\nI could be anything you like\n\nGotta be green, gotta be mean\nGotta be everything more\nDon't you like me? Don't you like me?\n\nI could be brown, I could be blue\nI could be violet sky\nCould be hurtful, could be purple\nI could be anything you like\nGotta be green, gotta be mean\nGotta be everything more\nWhy don't you like me? Don't you like me?\nWalk out the door!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b7wLP1Bmwg", "date_published": "2021-11-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
