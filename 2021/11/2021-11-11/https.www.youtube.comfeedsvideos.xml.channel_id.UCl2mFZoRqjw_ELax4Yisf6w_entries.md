Anyone can come by who wants to try out a soldering station, hot air station, and microscope, and get help with their soldering projects, or electronics troubleshooting. I can't guarantee a fix, or that you'll learn something, but it is free, so enjoy! When I started out doing board repair & doing surface mount soldering I would've killed to have been able to work on equipment with some instruction at no cost but nothing like this was available back then, so it makes me happy to be able to make it available now.
