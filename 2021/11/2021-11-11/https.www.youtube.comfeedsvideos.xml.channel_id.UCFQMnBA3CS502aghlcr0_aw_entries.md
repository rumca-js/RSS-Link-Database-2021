Tether's printer has gone into overdrive and it made me want to reflect on the time that the NYAG said Tether was unbacked, and compare it to today.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
