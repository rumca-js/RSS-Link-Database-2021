Due to this song’s most excellent resurgence on TikTok, we had to pay tribute to the great Mika! Also just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with our saxophonist friend, Grace Kelly on it. Win, win.

LYRICS
Do I attract you?
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?
Am I too dirty? Am I too flirty?
Do I like what you like?

I could be wholesome, I could be loathsome
I guess I'm a little bit shy
Why don't you like me, why don't you like me
Without making me try?

I tried to be like Grace Kelly
But all her looks were too sad
So I tried a little Freddie
I've gone identity mad!

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Don't you like me?
Walk out the door!

How can I help it, how can I help 
How can I help what you think?
Hello my baby, hello my baby
Putting my life on the brink

Why don't you like me, why don't you like me
Why don't you like yourself?
Should I bend over? Should I look older
To be put on your shelf?

I tried to be like Grace Kelly
But all her looks were too sad
So I tried a little Freddie
I've gone identity mad!

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
Could be hurtful, could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Don't you like me?
Walk out the door!

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, could be purple
I could be anything you like

Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Don't you like me? Don't you like me?

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
Could be hurtful, could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Don't you like me?
Walk out the door!
