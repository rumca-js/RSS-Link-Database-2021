Today I discuss rare Nintendo GameCube variation. All the GameCubes. Which one's are rare. Which one's are variants. It's sure to be a good time.

Now I can't promise this includes every different GameCube ever made, but it includes quite a few of the licensed models.

Faceplates are iffy, some of the more common one's I skipped out on.
It's a video about different GameCube's what do you want.
