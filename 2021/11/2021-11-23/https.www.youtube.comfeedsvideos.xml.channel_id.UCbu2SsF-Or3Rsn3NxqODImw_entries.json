Starting December 1, Xbox gold members can grab The Escapists 2 and Orcs Must Die, with the latter only being available until December 15. Starting on the 16th, members can grab Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition as well as Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.\n\nLastly, in other Xbox-related news, the Series X Mini Fridge is reportedly louder than most would like. Our very own Gabe Gurwin recently set up his fridge and found that it is \u201ceasily as loud or louder than the actual Xbox Series X or PS5 when they have discs spinning.\u201d\n\nFor more information on all of our topics, please visit gamespot.com.\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro - 00:00\nHalo Infinite - 00:06\nGames With Gold - 01:30\nXbox Mini Fridge - 02:06\nOutro - 02:52", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOL7gnTn-r0", "date_published": "2021-11-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Highs And Lows Of One Year All Digital", "description": "Marching into this new generation, Kurt made a conscious choice to go all-digital with the Xbox Series S and the Playstation 5. And the result has been, well, rather unexpected.\n\nGoing all-digital can be a troubling prospect for some gamers. No selling/trading in games? No borrowing or lending them? What if your favorite series just disappears off the digital marketplace? They're all valid points. But still, Kurt Indovina marched bravely, or maybe naively, into an all-digital future with the Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5 Digital Edition.\u00a0\n\nJoin Kurt on the highs and lows of his digital future, including his unexpected appreciation for past games.\u00a0\n\nThe digital future can feel like a brittle one. Games like Jump Force will cease to exist on digital storefronts come February 2022; Metal Gear Solid 2 & 3 have pulled due to licensing issues over archival footage; and Rockstar Games delisted GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas weeks before the release of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition. On the flipside, however, there's a lot for what digital features offer, like Xbox's Quick Resume, and the digital service Game Pass.\n\n#PS5 #XBOX", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_1l_FHym7I", "date_published": "2021-11-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
