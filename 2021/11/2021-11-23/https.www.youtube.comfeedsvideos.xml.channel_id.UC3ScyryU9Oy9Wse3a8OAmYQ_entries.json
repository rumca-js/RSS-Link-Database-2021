Watch an excerpt from the new documentary \u201cShots Fired,\u201d from FRONTLINE and The Salt Lake Tribune.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW\n\nIn Utah, there\u2019s no source that tracks police shootings statewide. The Salt Lake Tribune and FRONTLINE have been working together through FRONTLINE\u2019s Local Journalism Initiative to fill that gap and to go a step further: Building on years of the Tribune\u2019s earlier reporting on police violence, the team has been trying to understand the patterns and factors involved when Utah police fire their weapons.\n\nIn some cases, the data is incomplete and the numbers too small to draw broad conclusions. But in the reporting team\u2019s review of 226 Utah police shootings over the past decade, a few things stood out. More than half of the shootings were fatal, and the vast majority were ruled justified. Racial and ethnic minorities were disproportionately represented among the people at whom police fired. More than 40 percent of people shot at were identified by police or families to have had a mental health issue, a mental disability or to have been suicidal.\n\nAnd over and over again, when talking about why they fired, officers referenced their training.\n\nThis excerpt from the documentary \u201cShots Fired\u201d offers a rare look inside police training in Utah, examining how it may impact whom, when and why officers shoot, and exploring why a focus on worst-case scenarios in training has become increasingly controversial among experts concerned about police shootings.\n\n\u201cShots Fired\u201d is the first nationally broadcast documentary stemming from FRONTLINE\u2019s Local Journalism Initiative, an innovative effort to support and strengthen investigative reporting in communities around the country that's funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and based out of FRONTLINE\u2019s newsroom at GBH in Boston.\n\n\u201cShots Fired\u201d premieres Nov. 23, 2021 on FRONTLINE: https://to.pbs.org/3CPE7cZ\n\nFor more reporting in connection with this investigation with our Local Journalism Initiative partner The Salt Lake Tribune, visit FRONTLINE\u2019s website: https://to.pbs.org/3CPE7cZ\n\n\u201cShots Fired\u201d is a FRONTLINE production with Five O\u2019Clock Films.
