‘Tis the season to get a moose and support two great causes - Save the Children and Ornaments for Orphans! We’ve put together this “Holiday Bundle” - one adorable handmade moose ornament + 2 albums: “Winter Wishes” and “Invisible People.” Go to pomplamoose.com to get yer moose (only 250 available), and it’ll help provide clean water and education to kids around the world.
