In Utah, there’s no source that tracks police shootings statewide. The Salt Lake Tribune and FRONTLINE have been working together through FRONTLINE’s Local Journalism Initiative to fill that gap and to go a step further: Building on years of the Tribune’s earlier reporting on police violence, the team has been trying to understand the patterns and factors involved when Utah police fire their weapons.

In some cases, the data is incomplete and the numbers too small to draw broad conclusions. But in the reporting team’s review of 226 Utah police shootings over the past decade, a few things stood out. More than half of the shootings were fatal, and the vast majority were ruled justified. Racial and ethnic minorities were disproportionately represented among the people at whom police fired. More than 40 percent of people shot at were identified by police or families to have had a mental health issue, a mental disability or to have been suicidal.

And over and over again, when talking about why they fired, officers referenced their training.

This excerpt from the documentary “Shots Fired” offers a rare look inside police training in Utah, examining how it may impact whom, when and why officers shoot, and exploring why a focus on worst-case scenarios in training has become increasingly controversial among experts concerned about police shootings.
