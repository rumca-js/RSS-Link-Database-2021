Deficiency of vit D limits the performance of systems resulting in, increased spread of diseases of civilization

Reduced protection against infections

Reduced effectiveness of vaccination
 
Covid fatality rates correlate with,

Elderly, dark, black people, comorbidities, winter

Blood level of 20 ng/mL, (50 nmol/L) sufficient to stop osteomalacia

Preferable, 40–60 ng/mL (100 to 150 nmol/L)

Vitamin D3 receptors

Bone

Intestine

Pancreas

Prostate

Immune system cells

Vitamin D is a powerful epigenetic regulator

Influencing more than 2,500 genes

Cancer

Diabetes mellitus

Acute respiratory tract infections

Viral lung infections that cause ARDS

Chronic inflammatory diseases

Autoimmune diseases

Multiple sclerosis

Immunomodulatory properties

Regulating innate and adaptive immune systems

D3 receptors 

Monocytes/macrophages

T cells

B cells

Natural killer (NK) cells

Dendritic cells (DCs)

Supplements

Without calcium supplementation, even very high vitamin D3 supplementation does not cause vascular calcification

Vitamin D3 supplementation in the range of 4000 to 10,000 units (100 to 250 µg) needed to generate an optimal 40–60 ng/mL (100 to 150 nmol/L)

has been shown to be completely safe when combined with approximately 200 µg vitamin K2

However, this knowledge is still not widespread in the medical community, and obsolete warnings about the risks of vitamin D3 overdoses unfortunately are still commonly circulating.

ARDS and cytokine release syndrome

Vitamin D3 is able to inhibit the underlying metabolic pathways

Vitamin D3 has a protective role against ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2. 

A rapidly increasing number of publications are investigating the vitamin D3 status of SARS-CoV-2 patients,

and have confirmed low vitamin D levels in cases of severe courses of infection 

and positive results of vitamin D3 treatments 

Conclusions

we recommend raising serum 25(OH)D levels to above 50 ng/mL (100 to 150 nmol/L)

to prevent or mitigate new outbreaks due to escape mutations or decreasing antibody activity.

At a time when vaccination was not yet available,

patients with sufficiently high D3 serum levels preceding the infection were highly unlikely to suffer a fatal outcome. 

This correlation should have been good news when vaccination was not available but instead was widely ignored. 

the lower threshold for healthy vitamin D levels should lie at approximately 125 nmol/L or 50 ng/mL 25(OH)D3,

which would save most lives, reducing the impact even for patients with various comorbidities.

This is—to our knowledge—the first study that aimed to determine an optimum D3 level to minimize COVID-19 mortality

Implications for herd immunity

It seems clear that a good immune defense, 

does not prove protection against physical infection 

but rather against its consequences

This “protection” was most effective at ~55 ng/mL

Traditionally living populations in East Africa have a mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 115 nmol/l
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/traditionally-living-populations-in-east-africa-have-a-mean-serum-25hydroxyvitamin-d-concentration-of-115-nmoll/6188564A01361C5CF5F196229430E475

natural vitamin D3 levels seen among traditional hunter/gatherer lifestyles,

in a highly infectious environment, 

were 110–125 nmol/L (45–50 ng/mL)

WHO advice may not be correct

30 ng/mL D3 value considered by the WHO as the threshold for sufficiency

Future mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, vaccine immune escape

the entire population should raise their serum vitamin D level to a safe level as soon as possible. 

As long as enough vitamin K2 is provided, the suggested D3 levels are entirely safe to achieve by supplementation. 

Selenium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamins A and E should also be controlled for and supplemented where necessary to optimize the conditions for a well-functioning immune system.

Next study

test PCR-positive contacts of an infected person for D3 levels immediately, i.e., 

before the onset of any symptoms, 

and then follow them for 4 weeks and relate the course of their symptomatology to the D3 level, 

the same result as shown above must be obtained

COVID-19 Mortality Risk Correlates Inversely with Vitamin D3 Status, 

a Mortality Rate Close to Zero Could Theoretically Be Achieved at 50 ng/mL 25(OH)D3: (125 nmol/L)

Results of a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/10/3596

Blood calcifediol (25(OH)D3) levels correlate strongly with SARS-CoV-2 infection severity

Cause or effect?

Strength of our immune system,

More or less neglected by the responsible authorities

Nutrition, physical fitness, recreation, sleep

Widespread vitamin D deficiency

Data collected March 2021

Methods

Systematic literature search

Retrospective cohort studies (1)

Clinical studies (7) on COVID-19 mortality rates versus D3 blood levels

Reported D3 blood levels pre-infection or on the day of hospital admission

Mortality rates, corrected for age, sex, and diabetes

Results

Negative Pearson correlation of D3 levels and mortality risk

r = −0.4154, p = 0.0770

r = −0.4886, p = 0.0646

Combined data

Median D3 levels were 23.2 ng/mL (58 nmol/L)

Pearson correlation = −0.3989, p = 0.0194

Regression suggested a theoretical point of zero mortality at approximately 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) D3

Conclusions

The datasets provide strong evidence that low D3 is a predictor rather than just a side effect of the infection. 

Despite ongoing vaccinations, we recommend raising serum 25(OH)D levels to above 50 ng/mL
