In today’s episode of GameSpot News, DeVante talks about the latest update involving Activision Blizzard, the modding community improving the GTA trilogy, and more. 

The first story involves a bombshell report from the Wall Street Journal that covers numerous allegations at Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, including that he had knowledge of numerous sexual assault and harassment claims at the company's various studios. In the wake of this, Kotick released an internal video message to staff, but a group of employees are now staging a walkout.

Devante also talks about the GTA modding community taking it upon themselves to make improvements to the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. Outside of fixing visual issues, some modders have also gotten busy restoring the classic feel of The Trilogy's games.

Later in the video, DeVante also covers Far Cry 6, as the game's new Vaas Insanity DLC has launched, alongside new Breaking Bad-inspired cosmetics. November 16 also saw the release of a new Far Cry 6 hotfix that fixes various issues and in addition to the paid content, Far Cry 6 will offer free expansions featuring missions involving Danny Trejo, Stranger Things, and Rambo.

In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Battlefield 2042’s rubber banding issues being investigated by DICE, Saints Row Reboot being delayed to August 2022 and shareholders calling for Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick to resign.

In this video, DeVante talks about DICE investigating Battlefield 2042’s rubber banding issues. Rubber banding results in players snapping between two positions on a map, hence the name. It stems from high latency or packet loss, as a player's position in-game desynchronizes with the location the game server has them in.

DeVante also talks about the Saints Row reboot being delayed. Originally scheduled for release on February 25, 2022, the game is now launching six months later, on August 23, 2022.  

Later in the video, shareholders call for Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick to resign following a report that he knew of misconduct at the company.

## Dying Light 2 Hands-On Preview

We got hands-on time with Dying Light 2, the anticipated sequel to 2016's open-world post-apocalyptic game. 

The build Mark Delaney played was about a month old and kicked off in the game's opening region Old Villedor. This was, as lead game designer Tymon Smektala explained it, a tamer region meant to allow players to get to grips with the game's melee combat and parkour moves, and come to understand how to manage crowds of infected and survivors alike.

The first thing I realized when I started to play Dying Light 2 was how fluid the movement felt. Smart changes like faster strafing and back-pedaling, and an always-on sprint ability, make the anti-hero protagonist Aiden Caldwell feel more adept at performing his death-defying feats than Kyle Crane ever was. He's lighter on his feet and animations are smoother, even from the get-go, and despite me seeing some really tantalizing skills not yet unlocked during my play sessions. I especially loved how quickly I was able to intuit whether or not I could make any particular jump. The mechanics are improved across the board and give the controls a faster, more reliable feeling in my hands.
