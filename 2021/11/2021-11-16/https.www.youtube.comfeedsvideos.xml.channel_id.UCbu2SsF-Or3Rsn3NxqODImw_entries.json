In the wake of this, Kotick released an internal video message to staff, but a group of employees are now staging a walkout.\n\nDevante also talks about the GTA modding community taking it upon themselves to make improvements to the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. Outside of fixing visual issues, some modders have also gotten busy restoring the classic feel of The Trilogy's games.\n\nLater in the video, DeVante also covers Far Cry 6, as the game's new Vaas Insanity DLC has launched, alongside new Breaking Bad-inspired cosmetics.

Rubber banding results in players snapping between two positions on a map, hence the name. It stems from high latency or packet loss, as a player's position in-game desynchronizes with the location the game server has them in.\n\nDeVante also talks about the Saints Row reboot being delayed. Originally scheduled for release on February 25, 2022, the game is now launching six months later, on August 23, 2022.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLater in the video, shareholders call for Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick to resign following a report that he knew of misconduct at the company.\u00a0\n\nTIME STAMPS\n00:00 - Intro\n00:06 - Battlefield 2042 Issues\n01:12 - Saints Row Delayed\n02:12 - Activision Blizzard Update", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF8r5pBveIY", "date_published": "2021-11-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl Review-In-Progress", "description": "Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are comfortably nostalgic, with just enough modern tweaks to smooth over the rough edges.\n\nNintendo and ILCA's Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl will be available on Nintendo Switch on November 19, 2021.

This was, as lead game designer Tymon Smektala explained it, a tamer region meant to allow players to get to grips with the game's melee combat and parkour moves, and come to understand how to manage crowds of infected and survivors alike.\n\nThe first thing I realized when I started to play Dying Light 2 was how fluid the movement felt. Smart changes like faster strafing and back-pedaling, and an always-on sprint ability, make the anti-hero protagonist Aiden Caldwell feel more adept at performing his death-defying feats than Kyle Crane ever was. He's lighter on his feet and animations are smoother, even from the get-go, and despite me seeing some really tantalizing skills not yet unlocked during my play sessions. I especially loved how quickly I was able to intuit whether or not I could make any particular jump. The mechanics are improved across the board and give the controls a faster, more reliable feeling in my hands. \n\n#DyingLight2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pl-MdM1-i4", "date_published": "2021-11-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fortnite X Naruto Shippuden Trailer", "description": "Naruto and Team 7 from Naruto Shippuden join the Fortnite Crew.\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode.
