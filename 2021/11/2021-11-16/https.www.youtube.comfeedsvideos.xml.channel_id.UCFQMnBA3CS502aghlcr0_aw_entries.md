This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.

Drake Bell tried pulling a fast one and got caught... again. Possibly the dumbest case I've ever taken, since it's all public info on the blockchain, but remember, if you're an influencer shilling NFTs -----
