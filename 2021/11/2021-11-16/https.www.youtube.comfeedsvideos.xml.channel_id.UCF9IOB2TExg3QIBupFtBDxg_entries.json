calcification\n\nVitamin D3 supplementation in the range of 4000 to 10,000 units (100 to 250 \u00b5g) needed to generate an optimal 40\u201360 ng/mL (100 to 150 nmol/L)\n\nhas been shown to be completely safe when combined with approximately 200 \u00b5g vitamin K2\n\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-k/\n\nHowever, this knowledge is still not widespread in the medical community, and obsolete warnings about the risks of vitamin D3 overdoses unfortunately are still commonly circulating.\n\nARDS and cytokine release syndrome\n\nVitamin D3 is able to inhibit the underlying metabolic pathways\n\nVitamin D3 has a protective role against ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2. \n\nA rapidly increasing number of publications are investigating the vitamin D3 status of SARS-CoV-2 patients,\n\nand have confirmed low vitamin D levels in cases of severe courses of infection \n\nand positive results of vitamin D3 treatments \n\nConclusions\n\nwe recommend raising serum 25(OH)D levels to above 50 ng/mL (100 to 150 nmol/L)\n\nto prevent or mitigate new outbreaks due to escape mutations or decreasing antibody activity.\n\nAt a time when vaccination was not yet available,\n\npatients with sufficiently high D3 serum levels preceding the infection were highly unlikely to suffer a fatal outcome. \n\nThis correlation should have been good news when vaccination was not available but instead was widely ignored. \n\nthe lower threshold for healthy vitamin D levels should lie at approximately 125 nmol/L or 50 ng/mL 25(OH)D3,\n\nwhich would save most lives, reducing the impact even for patients with various comorbidities.\n\nThis is\u2014to our knowledge\u2014the first study that aimed to determine an optimum D3 level to minimize COVID-19 mortality\n\nImplications for herd immunity\n\nIt seems clear that a good immune defense, \n\ndoes not prove protection against physical infection \n\nbut rather against its consequences\n\nThis \u201cprotection\u201d was most effective at ~55 ng/mL\n\nTraditionally living populations in East Africa have a mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 115

D3 value considered by the WHO as the threshold for sufficiency\n\nFuture mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, vaccine immune escape\n\nthe entire population should raise their serum vitamin D level to a safe level as soon as possible. \n\nAs long as enough vitamin K2 is provided, the suggested D3 levels are entirely safe to achieve by supplementation. \n\nSelenium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamins A and E should also be controlled for and supplemented where necessary to optimize the conditions for a well-functioning immune system.\n\nNext study\n\ntest PCR-positive contacts of an infected person for D3 levels immediately, i.e., \n\nbefore the onset of any symptoms, \n\nand then follow them for 4 weeks and relate the course of their symptomatology to the D3 level, \n\nthe same result as shown above must be obtained", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5g9AVqRsjo", "date_published": "2021-11-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source":
