Risk for Stillbirth Among Women With and Without COVID-19 at Delivery Hospitalization â€” United States, March 2020â€“September 2021

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7047e1.htm?s_cid=mm7047e1_x

Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe COVID-19â€“related illness

COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes,

and maternal and neonatal complications

Stillbirth during March 2020â€“September 2021

N = 1,249,634 deliveries

Stillbirths were rare (8,154; 0.65%)

21,653 deliveries to women with COVID-19 at the delivery hospitalization

273 (1.26%)

1,227,981 deliveries without COVID-19

7,881 (0.64%)

Prepandemic stillbirth rate 0.59%

Results, March 2020â€“September 2021

Adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.90

March 2020â€“June 2021, pre-delta

aRR = 1.47

0.98% of COVID-19â€“affected deliveries resulted in stillbirth

Julyâ€“September 2021, delta

aRR = 4.04

2.7% of COVID-19â€“affected deliveries resulted in stillbirth

Implications

Implementing evidence-based COVID-19 prevention strategies, 

including vaccination before or during pregnancy,

is critical to reducing the impact of COVID-19 on stillbirths.

Stillbirths, defined as fetal deaths at â‰¥20 weeksâ€™ gestation

53.7% of women were non-Hispanic White

50.6% had private insurance

15.4% had obesity

11.2% had diabetes

17.2% had a hypertensive disorder

1.8% had a multiple-gestation pregnancy

4.9% had smoking (tobacco) documented

Pathophysiology

Placental histopathologic abnormalities, suggesting placental hypoperfusion and inflammation,

might occur with maternal COVID-19 infection

Need for pre and post delta placental studies

Mississippi, Black and Hispanic women accounted for 12 of the 15 covid-associated deaths

(50% of infections)
