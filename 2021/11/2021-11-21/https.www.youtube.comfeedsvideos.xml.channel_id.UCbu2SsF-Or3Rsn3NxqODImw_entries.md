In today’s GameSpot News, Persia talks about Mass Effect Legendary Edition possibly coming to Xbox Game Pass, some fighting game announcements, and more.

According to Polish website XGP, and reported by VGC, the Mass Effect Legendary Edition might be heading to Xbox Game Pass as early as this week, according to an apparently accidental listing on the Xbox Store. 

Later in the video, Persia talks about some recent fighting game news starting with Riot Games revealing more information on Project L, a 2D fighting game set in Runeterra. As an assist-based fighter, players will build a team of two different champions that they can switch between during a match, and the game will reward "strategic team building, on the fly decision-making, and strong fighting fundamentals."

Peria also covers the addition of Ryu, Chun-Li, and Akuma from Street Fighter crossing over with Ubisoft's free-to-play fighting game Brawlhalla. This is the latest set of characters announces as a part of Brawlhalla's "epic crossovers" event.

From Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo Infinite, Xbox’s biggest franchise has been defined by battle rifles, explosions, and murdering Elites. Yet in 2009, Bungie delivered a more somber FPS experience with Halo 3: ODST. And, for producer Jessie Earl, Halo 3: ODST is far and away the best campaign in the entire Halo franchise. 

Yes, better than Halo 2, Halo Reach, or especially Halo 5: Guardians. 

Halo 3 ODST is the game that should not be. Not only is ODST a complete tonal shift for the franchise, focusing on a more somber, small stakes story, it was also created out of the ashes of a completely different Halo project and made in basically a single year. This game should be a complete mess.

Yet, instead Bungie’s Halo 3: ODST is a masterclass in tone, storytelling, and game design that resonates, even more, today than it did back when it was released. So let’s break down why this underappreciated gem still holds up amidst its blockbuster siblings.
