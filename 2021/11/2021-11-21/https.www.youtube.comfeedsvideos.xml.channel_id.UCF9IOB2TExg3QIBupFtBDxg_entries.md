Risk of spontaneous abortion after vaccination

Risk of Stillbirth Among Women With and Without COVID-19 at Delivery Hospitalization â€” United States, March 2020â€“September 2021

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7047e1.htm?s_cid=mm7047e1_x

Sixth, it was not possible to assess vaccination status in this analysis. 

However, because COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, and COVID-19 vaccination coverage among pregnant women was approximately 30% as of July 2021,

most women with COVID-19 at delivery were likely unvaccinated.

Etiology of Spontaneous Abortion

https://www.msdmanuals.com/en-gb/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/abnormalities-of-pregnancy/spontaneous-abortion

Sporadic

cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, parvovirus, and rubella virus

live vaccines, not in pregnancy

non-live vaccines have previously been shown to be safe in pregnancy (flu and whooping cough)

Recurrent

Genetic abnormalities

Immunologic abnormalities

Major trauma

Uterine abnormalities

Most often, the cause is unknown

Risk factors for spontaneous abortion include

Age more than 35

History of spontaneous abortion
Cigarette smoking

Use of certain drugs (eg, cocaine, alcohol, high doses of caffeine)

A poorly controlled chronic disorder (eg, diabetes, hypertension, overt thyroid disorders) in the mother

Spontaneous Abortion Following COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy (8 September 2021)

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784193

Concerns regarding risks of spontaneous abortion may be a barrier to vaccination during pregnancy

We present findings from case-control surveillance of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and spontaneous abortion.

Methods

Data from 8 health systems (Kaiser Permanente: Washington, Northwest, Northern California, Southern California, and Colorado; Denver Health; HealthPartners; and Marshfield Clinic, Wisconsin)

4-week surveillance periods from December 15, 2020, through June 28, 2021

Ongoing pregnancies between 6 and 19 weeksâ€™ gestation

Results

Of 105,446 pregnancies 

13,160 spontaneous abortions

92,286 ongoing pregnancies were identified

Vaccine during pregnancy and before 20 weeksâ€™ gestation

7.8% of women received 1 or more BNT162b2

6.0% received 1 or more mRNA-1273 (Moderna)

0.5% received an Ad26.COV.2.S (Janssen)

A COVID-19 vaccine was received within 28 days prior to an index date

8.0% of ongoing pregnancy periods

8.6% of spontaneous abortions

Spontaneous abortions did not have an increased odds of exposure to a COVID-19 vaccination in the prior 28 days compared with ongoing pregnancies

adjusted odds ratio, 1.02

Results were consistent for mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 and by gestational age group

Discussion

Despite limitations, these data can be used to inform vaccine recommendations and to counsel patients.

Receipt of mRNA Covid-19 Vaccines and Risk of Spontaneous Abortion

(14 October 2021)

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113891

Singleton pregnancy, n = 2,456

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafepregnancyregistry.html

v-safe Covid-19 vaccine pregnancy registry 

who had received at least one dose of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine,

either before conception or before 20 weeks of gestation,

52.7% had received the BNT162b2 vaccine

The cumulative risk of spontaneous abortion from 6 to less than 20 weeks of gestation was 14.1%

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113516

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMx210016

The estimated risks (14.1% overall and 12.8% in age-standardized analyses) are consistent with the risks of spontaneous abortion reported in the general population

COVID-19 vaccines are recommended in pregnancy.

Vaccination is the best way to protect against the known risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy for both women and babies, 

including admission of the woman to intensive care and premature birth of the baby

You should not stop breastfeeding in order to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

Women trying to become pregnant do not need to avoid pregnancy after vaccination, 

there is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines will affect fertility.

So far (11th October)

more than 82,000 pregnant women in England have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination and 

Public Health Scotland have reported that more than 19,000 pregnant women have received a vaccine, 

with no serious adverse effects recorded.

Research from across six studies in four countries, 

involving more than 40,000 pregnant women, 

shows having the vaccine does not increase the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, nor does it increase the risk of a small-for-gestational age baby, 

or the risk of congenital abnormalities.

Risk for Stillbirth Among Women With and Without COVID-19 at Delivery Hospitalization â€” United States, March 2020â€“September 2021

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7047e1.htm?s_cid=mm7047e1_x

Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe COVID-19â€“related illness

COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes,

and maternal and neonatal complications

Stillbirth during March 2020â€“September 2021

N = 1,249,634 deliveries

Stillbirths were rare (8,154; 0.65%)

21,653 deliveries to women with COVID-19 at the delivery hospitalization

273 (1.26%)

1,227,981 deliveries without COVID-19

7,881 (0.64%)

Prepandemic stillbirth rate 0.59%

Results, March 2020â€“September 2021

Adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.90

March 2020â€“June 2021, pre-delta

aRR = 1.47

0.98% of COVID-19â€“affected deliveries resulted in stillbirth

Julyâ€“September 2021, delta

aRR = 4.04

2.7% of COVID-19â€“affected deliveries resulted in stillbirth

Implications

Implementing evidence-based COVID-19 prevention strategies, 

including vaccination before or during pregnancy,

is critical to reducing the impact of COVID-19 on stillbirths.

Stillbirths, defined as fetal deaths at â‰¥20 weeksâ€™ gestation

53.7% of women were non-Hispanic White

50.6% had private insurance

15.4% had obesity

11.2% had diabetes

17.2% had a hypertensive disorder

1.8% had a multiple-gestation pregnancy

4.9% had smoking (tobacco) documented

Pathophysiology

Placental histopathologic abnormalities, suggesting placental hypoperfusion and inflammation,

might occur with maternal COVID-19 infection

Need for pre and post delta placental studies

Mississippi, Black and Hispanic women accounted for 12 of the 15 covid-associated deaths

(50% of infections)
