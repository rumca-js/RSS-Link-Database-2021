The Halo Universe has one of the richest and densest mythos in all of gaming, and with Halo Infinite promising to build on all this lore, it can easily feel overwhelming to newcomers. Don’t worry, we’ve got you like the Master Chief has Cortana, because we’re going to take you on the Great Journey through The Complete Timeline of the Halo Franchise.

Despite the seemingly straightforward story stretching from Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo 5: Guardians, the story of Master Chief stretches back well before humanity discovered their first Halo ring or began fighting the Flood. So in case you need a refresher on everything from the Forerunners to Halo Wars to who the big bad villain Atriox is for Halo Infinite, look no further.
