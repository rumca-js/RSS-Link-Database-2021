Halo Infinite and the hotly anticipated Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach are both on their way. There's also a slew of fun indie titles that are definitely worth your attention, plus a Danganronpa collection for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:17 - Danganronpa Decadence\n2:38 - Cricket 22\n3:18 - Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition\n3:52 - Halo Infinite\n5:18 - Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach\n5:53 - Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker\n6:19 - Happy's Humble Burger Farm\n6:38 - White Shadows\n6:54 - KEO\n7:09 - Firegirl Hack 'n Splash Rescue\n7:26 - Rogue Invader\n7:46 - Trash Sailors\n8:00 - The Gunk", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl3moQyL1z4", "date_published": "2021-11-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Complete HALO Timeline Explained!", "description": "The Halo Universe has one of the richest and densest mythos in all of gaming, and with Halo Infinite promising to build on all this lore, it can easily feel overwhelming to newcomers. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you like the Master Chief has Cortana, because we\u2019re going to take you on the Great Journey through The Complete Timeline of the Halo Franchise.\n\nDespite the seemingly straightforward story stretching from Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo 5: Guardians, the story of Master Chief stretches back well before humanity discovered their first Halo ring or began fighting the Flood. So in case you need a refresher on everything from the Forerunners to Halo Wars to who the big bad villain Atriox is for Halo Infinite, look no further.\n\nFILE NAME: HaloTimelineV4.mp4\n\n0:00 - Opening\n1:00 - Precursor - Forerunner War\n2:40 - Human- Forerunner War\n4:44 - Activating the Halo Arrays\n7:33 - Early Covenant/Human History\n8:10 - Creation of the Spartan-IIs\n9:18 - Halo Wars\n10:59 - Halo Reach\n12:11 - Halo: Combat Evolved\n14:00 - Halo 2\n15:15 - Halo 3: ODST\n16:01 - Halo 2 Part 2\n17:46 - Halo 3\n20:58 - Halo 4\n23:25 - Halo 4: Spartan Ops\n24:27 - Halo 5: Guardians\n26:58 - Halo Wars 2\n28:34 - Halo Infinite", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mnjy_d3wHY", "date_published": "2021-11-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "21 Best Free PC Games To Play", "description": "Here's a big list of the best free games on PC.\n\nGames are overflowing with free-to-play titles.
