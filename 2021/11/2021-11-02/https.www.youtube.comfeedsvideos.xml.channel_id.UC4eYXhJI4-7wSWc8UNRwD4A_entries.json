Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAnamaria Sayre | November 3, 2021\nEvery inch of Joss Favela\u2019s Sinaloa-based, sombrero-shrouded \u201cEl Tiny\u201d concert invokes the musical lineage of Mexican Regional music. Mixing soulful vocals with twangy guitars and a classic accordion, he opens with a sweet rendition of a genre staple, love ballad \u201cPienso en T\u00ed.\u201d Next, he dips into a heartfelt, piano-driven version of a song he wrote for his sister \u201cLa Mejor Versi\u00f3n de Mi.\u201d Taking a beat between the tracks, he invites us to partake in the legacy of generations of caballeros that preceded him. \u201cYo soy de un rancho que se llama Caitime, Sinaloa, Mexico y con esta m\u00fasica crecimos,\u201d he says, \u201cesta m\u00fasica vivimos, y nos gusta porque son nuestras ra\u00edces, nuestra cultura, nuestra gente. (I\u2019m from a ranch town called Caitime, Sinaloa, Mexico and we grew up with this music, we live this music and we like it because it\u2019s our roots, our culture, our people.)\u201d\n\nAfter moving through an upbeat performance of \u201cEl Alumno,\u201d Kinky bassist Cesar Pliego Villarreal joins the ranchero ensemble. The Monterrey native uses his bass to infuse a different Mexican tradition on three more classic Regional tracks: \u201cMe Vas a Extranar,\u201d \u201cBonita\u201d and \u201cCuando Fuimos Nada.\u201d\n\nAs torch-bearers of a complex and beloved sonic tradition, one can imagine there are moments for Mexican Regional stars where preservation precedes performance. At the end of his Tiny Desk, the caballero pauses and allows sweet accordion sounds carrying souls of the past to fill the space.\n\n\u201cMuchas gracias Tiny Desk,\u201d Favela says, \u201cpor llevar nuestra m\u00fasica regional a tantos lugares,\ny tantos corazones. (Thank you very much Tiny Desk for taking our regional music to so many places, and so many hearts.)\u201d\n\nSET LIST\n* \"Pienso en Ti\"\n* \"La Mejor Versi\u00f3n de M\u00ed\"\n* \"El Alumno\"\n* \"Me Vas a Extra\u00f1ar\"\n* \"Bonita\"\n* \"Cuando Fuimos Nada\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n* Joss Favela: vocals, guitar\n* Cesar Pliego Villarreal: bajo quinto\n* Daniel Valenzuela Le\u00f3n: accordion, bass\n* Gustavo A.
