What makes Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception the most important game in the series? DeVante Chisolm takes a look at how Uncharted 3 lived up to its predecessor, what it did for the franchise and how it holds up in a post-Uncharted 4 world.

November 1st, 2021, marks the 10th anniversary of Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception and even though Uncharted 2 and 4 are widely held up as the best in the series, Uncharted 3 is the most important for Nate’s development. If each game boils down to searching for treasure, then Uncharted 3 was the first to include the subtext of Nate searching for himself. 

In this videos, DeVante celebrates the anniversary of Nathan Drake’s third adventure and revisits Uncharted 3 to see what makes it so special. 

Uncharted 3 originally released on PS3 in 2011, but is now available on PS4/PS5 via The Nathan Drake Collection. The game will also come to PC in early 2022 via the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection.
