In interviews with the sailors, Bikel learns of some of the high-pressure police interrogation techniques, including the threat of the death penalty, sleep deprivation and intimidation, that led each of the \u201cNorfolk Four\u201d to confess, despite the lack of any evidence linking them to the crime.\n\nLove FRONTLINE?
