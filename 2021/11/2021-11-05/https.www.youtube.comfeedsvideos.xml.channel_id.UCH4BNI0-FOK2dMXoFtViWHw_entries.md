The biggest thing that has ever lived on Earth… is a tree? Hard to believe, but it’s true. Travel with me to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado to go inside the most massive species on our planet, and learn what unique and special evolutionary adaptations let them get so big. 

Thanks to Dr. Jeffry B. Mitton (UC-Boulder) for sharing his years of research into giant quaking aspens and for telling us where to go see such pretty fall colors
