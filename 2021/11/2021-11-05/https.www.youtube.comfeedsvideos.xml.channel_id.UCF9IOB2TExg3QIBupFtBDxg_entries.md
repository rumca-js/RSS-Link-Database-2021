Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer’s vaccine trial, 
Revelations of poor practices at a contract research company
https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635

Pfizer’s pivotal covid-19 vaccine trial, 

raise questions about data integrity and regulatory oversight

This was the original paper

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577

 Autumn 2020

Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, Albert Bourla

As I’ve said before, we are operating at the speed of science

Ventavia Research Group

https://www.ventaviaresearch.com

Researchers were testing Pfizer’s vaccine at several sites in Texas

A regional director, Brook Jackson has told The BMJ that the company

falsified data

unblinded patients

employed inadequately trained vaccinators

was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial

Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding. 

US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were informed

Ventavia fired her later the same day. 

The BMJ has been provided with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails.

She repeatedly informed her superiors

poor laboratory management

patient safety concerns

data integrity issues

that drug assignment confirmation printouts were being left in participants’ charts, accessible to blinded personnel (later corrected)

company wasn’t able to quantify the types and number of errors they were finding when examining the trial paperwork for quality control

ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding queries older than three days

Worries over FDA inspection

Concerns raised

Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff

Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events

Protocol deviations not being reported

Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures

Mislabelled laboratory specimens

Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.

FDA advisory committee meeting held on 10 December 2020

Problems at Ventavia not mentioned

The next day the FDA issued the authorisation of the vaccine
 
In August this year, after full FDA approval of Pfizer’s vaccine

FDA published that 9 of the trials 153 sites were inspected

FDA, full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-19

Other employees’ accounts

everything that you complained about was spot on

Two former Ventavia employees spoke to The BMJ anonymously for fear of reprisal and loss of job prospects in the tightly knit research community

I don’t think it was good clean data

It’s a crazy mess

Pfizer has hired Ventavia as a research subcontractor on four other vaccine clinical trials

covid-19 vaccine in children and young adults

pregnant women

a booster dose

an RSV vaccine trial

Basically, we need to change the vaccine administration guidelines to include precautionary aspiration, prior to pushing in the vaccine. This will prevent cases of inadvertent intravascular administration of vaccine.

Here is some discussion to suggest inadvertent intravascular vaccine administration is a variable in the aetiology of complications after adenoviral vector vaccine administration and after mRNA vaccines.

These adverse events, although rare have reduced public confidence in covid vaccination, especially amongst the young, where vaccine rates are lowest.

It has long been known that intravenous injection of adenovirus leads to TTS in mice

https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/109/7/2832/125650/Adenovirus-induced-thrombocytopenia-the-role-of

Now, new covid vaccine specific work agrees with this previous work

Thrombocytopenia and splenic platelet directed immune responses after intravenous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration (29th June 2021)

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.29.450356v1

The authors conclude, ‘Our work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS.’ 

‘We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation.’ 

‘Hence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.’

Also after giving mRNA vaccines

A new study finds that giving mice intravenous mRNA vaccine also causes heart inflammation in mice. 

Intravenous Injection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccine Can Induce Acute Myopericarditis in Mouse Model (August 2021)

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab707/6353927

‘Our study indicates that IV injection of vaccines might partially contribute to this clinical phenotype, thus warranting a reconsideration of the practice of IM injection without aspiration, which carries the risk of inadvertent IV injection.’ 

Agreement from ‘fact check’ from Leo Nicolai, Cardiology Fellow, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich:

(German Centre for Cardiovascular Research)

https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/incorrect-vaccine-administration-is-a-potential-cause-of-post-vaccine-adverse-effects-but-more-research-is-still-needed-to-confirm-or-reject-this-hypothesis/?fbclid=IwAR0nBbM6v0V2WPFn4LxIdfR4FNAvIzLGKhzFPdQPG8mu_FR1InB8OzYQgMc

‘Indeed, there is peer-reviewed work showing in mice that possibly intravenous injection of mRNA vaccine leads to myocardial inflammation.’

‘that intravenous injection of adenoviral vector based vaccine (AZ1222, ChAdOx1) leads to thrombocytopenia and platelet-directed immune responses, offering a possible explanation for vaccine-induced thrombosis/thrombocytopenia’

‘these data might indicate a simple measure to lower the incidence of vaccine-induced side effects,’

‘There is a lack of data on frequency and effects of IV injection in humans.’

Denmark has changed their national guidelines

Based on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before injection.
