Within these 20 maps lie a few remakes from Call of Duty's past, specifically from 2008's Call of Duty World at War. In this video we'll be taking a look back at the original maps and see how they compare to their remade counterparts 13 years later.\n\nWe begin with the fan-favorite \"Castle\" map. The medium sized battlefield was remembered for its few key elevation spots, as well as multiple routes that cut through the center as well as it's hectic west area where its stone stairs were a memorable hotspot. Next is the wildly popular \"Dome\". This small map was the \"Nuketown\" before the release of Black Ops 1. Its imamate, square design made battles here a cluster, no matter the player count. Lastly, the Sub Pens made was remade for both multiplayer as well as campaign. Featured early on in the \"Phoenix\" mission, this map has seen the most changes in it's redesign.\n\nCall of Duty Vanguard is finally here!
