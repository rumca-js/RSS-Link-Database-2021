Like going half on a store-bought rotisserie chicken. \"With mashed potatoes and cornbread,\" Kal adds.\n\n\"On God,\" Isaiah chimes in.\n\nIf Top Dawg thought there'd be fringe benefits to linking the Tennessee and Texas natives, he was right. They became fast homies before making even a lick of music together. That foundation was crucial. Cause when the music finally did come it needed to cut through everything blocking Isaiah Rashad's blessings.\n\nReleased last July, \"The House Is Burning\" could be interpreted as a metaphor for planet Earth's hot mess and Isaiah's own inner demons. To survive it all, Isaiah had to battle through rehab, writer's block and three months of refuge spent on Kal Banx's couch while his pockets were on E.\n\nMaybe by necessity, Kal became more than a star beatmaker. Studio sessions commenced only after he led Isaiah on silly diversions down the weirdest rabbit holes of YouTube. Laughing became existential. It helped Isaiah get out of his head, and get everything in his head committed to tape. On \"Hey Mista,\" one of several songs Banx produced or co-produced on the album, he cut and pasted bars freestyled by Zay into two verses and a bridge. And he took additional music cues from Isaiah to make beats that tapped into Zay's old soul.\n\nTogether, in the funniest sit-down of the new season of The Formula, they walk us through the making of the song that lit the spark for the album. In the process, they reveal how the best artist-producer collaborations work a lot like life \u2014 with real friends to distract us from, and soundtrack us through, all our drama.\n\nCREDITS\nHost/Series Producer: Rodney Carmichael; Producers: Tsering Bista, Nickolai Hammar; Editor: Annabel Edwards; Art Director/Animator: CJ Riculan; Animators: Jackie Lay, Alicia Zheng; Director of Photography: Nickolai Hammar; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Jack Corbett, Nickolai Hammar, Alicia Zheng; Production Assistant: Amna Ijaz; Project Coordinator: Erin Register; Legal Adviser: Kimberly Sullivan; Consulting Editors: Jacob Ganz, Sidney Madden; Supervising Producer, Nick Michael; Senior Producer: Abby O'Neill; Managing Editor: Becky Lettenberger; Executive Producers: Anya Grundmann, Keith Jenkins; Special Thanks: Hardpink Studio and Staff\n\nMUSIC\n\"Hey Mista,\" Isaiah Rashad, The House Is Burning (2021); \"Rose Water\" by DJ Face\n\n#isaiahrashad #kalbanx #theformula #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpeVQnwyxEc", "date_published": "2021-11-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
