Pharmacology

Specifically designed SARS-CoV-2-3CL protease inhibitor,

an enzyme that the coronavirus needs to replicate

Co-administration with a low dose of ritonavir helps slow the metabolism of PF-07321332

PF-07321332 inhibits viral replication at a stage known as proteolysis, 

which occurs before viral RNA replication

In preclinical studies, PF-07321332 did not demonstrate evidence of mutagenic DNA interactions.

EPIC-SR includes a cohort of vaccinated patients who have an acute breakthrough symptomatic COVID-19 infection and who have risk factors for severe illness.
