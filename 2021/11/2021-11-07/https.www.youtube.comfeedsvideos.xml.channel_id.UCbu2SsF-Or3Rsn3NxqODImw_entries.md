Get your first look at gameplay for Lies of P, a fantastically baroque Action RPG inspired by the classic Italian novel Pinocchio from Carlo Collodi.  The ruined, but once beautiful city of Krat is on full display in the new video. Hideous and twisted automatons rule the landscape, and it’s up to P to find Mr. Geppetto and reverse the calamity that has befallen Krat.

In the video, fans should notice the reactive counter-attacks, the array of unique weapons to find and put to use, and that Pinocchio's own mechanical arm acts as an additional tool or weapon to give unique skills - such as a grappling hook and more.

We're Commander Shepard and these are our favorite lines on the Citadel. To celebrate N7 Day, Jennifer Hale and Mark Meer join us to break down their favourite Commander Shepard lines from the Mass Effect trilogy.

Happy N7 Day! Every year, Mass Effect developer BioWare celebrates its beloved sci-fi trilogy on November 7, and this year we're joined by both Commander Shepards to break down the most iconic lines from the games.

Jennifer Hale and Mark Meer voice female and male Commander Shepard respectively, and over the years, have delivered some of the most iconic lines in gaming. From "I should go" to "I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite store on the Citadel," Jennifer and Mark react to the games after all these years, reveal what it was like to be in the recording booth, and whether they thought the lines would become as infamous as they did. 

Earlier this year, a remaster of the Mass Effect trilogy, Mass Effect: Legendary Edition, launched on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. In our review, Jordan Ramée gave it an 8/10, praising its visual updates and changes to the original Mass Effect to modernize its controls.
