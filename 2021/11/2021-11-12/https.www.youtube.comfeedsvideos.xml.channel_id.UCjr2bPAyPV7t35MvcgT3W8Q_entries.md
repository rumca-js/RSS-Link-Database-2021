3D printing can do a lot. Doctors 3D-print customized implants and even medication with individual dosage needs. Rapid prototyping has relied on 3D printing for a decade now. There’s this themed restaurant in London where everything, from chairs through cutlery and even food is printed from scratch. Recently, hobbyists and enthusiasts held a national competition for 3D-printed guns. First startups are popping up with promising technology to print affordable housing faster, cheaper and more sustainably. 

3D printers aren’t going to replace machines in traditional manufacturing. They’ll be their excellent companion. Bringing the best of the both worlds and eliminating their drawbacks. 3D printers can excel at customization and decentralizing the supply chain, while subtractive manufacturing can mass-produce at scale at low cost. We probably shouldn’t hope for 3D printing to be able to do more than that. But that might be more than enough.
