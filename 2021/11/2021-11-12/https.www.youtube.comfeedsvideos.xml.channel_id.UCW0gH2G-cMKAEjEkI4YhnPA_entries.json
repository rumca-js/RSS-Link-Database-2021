Despite his greatest desire to see Valinor, his fate would be to help others make the trip before he would finally sail in the Last Ship himself.\n\nHe would see both Morgoth and Sauron rise and fall, and rise again.  His incredible foresight leads him to gift his Ring of Power, Narya, to Gandalf.\n\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
