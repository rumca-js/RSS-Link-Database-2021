Hazard Zone is Battlefield 2042’s competitive extraction style game mode and it can be very challenging. Here’s the best way to use guns, specialists, and tactics to get those data drives and get out alive.

Battlefield 2042 has three main modes: All-Out Warfare, Portal, and Hazard Zone. Hazard Zone is an extraction mode that draws influence from hero shooters, popular battle royale titles, and games like Hunt: Showdown and Escape from Tarkov. In our 12-hour review event, we spent around four hours with the mode and learned a lot. Here’s what you should know. 

In this video, we’re giving you 18 things we wish we knew before playing. These tips will help you earn more Dark Market credits, help you develop tactics, cover what kind of guns to purchase at the start of each round, help you survive the extraction process, and more. We’ll also cover how mechanics like the Call-In tablet, plus system, and some specialist abilities work in slightly different ways in this mode, as well as some tactical dos and don’ts. 

Battlefield 2042 is out now in early access with a general release on November 19. The game has cross-progression, cross-play, and cross-buy on PC, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. It's worth noting, though, that matches sport aa lower player count on last-gen consoles. Head on over to YouTube.com/GameSpot for our review-in-progress, and more gameplay, like a video of a No Specialist Mode from Portal.

In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Battlefield 2042 launching with no scoreboard or in-game chat, Battlefield 2042 Portal servers being reset to "combat bad behavior", GTA Trilogy getting Pulled For PC and Sony revealing the most popular PS5 games. 

In this video, DeVante talks about Battlefield 2042 launching with missing features like no scoreboard or in-game chat. ICE plans to add voice chat to Battlefield 2042 in an official capacity after launch, and potentially as soon as "day 25" after release, which would be sometime in December. Also the "effectiveness" of XP farming servers in Portal mode has been reduced thanks to a new update. The development team also performed a hard reset of all Portal mode servers in order to free up more servers in the mode as well.

DeVante also talks about the GTA Trilogy getting pulled from PC and the Rockstar Games Launcher going down. Because GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas were de-listed on digital stores ahead of the Definitive Edition's release, there is currently no way to buy the games in any fashion on PC right now.

Later in the video, Sony reveals most popular PS5 games on console's first birthday.

## The Bee That Broke Skyrim

Skyrim's intro is iconic, but the classic opening-turned-meme almost didn't happen due to a bug in the game--to be more specific, a bee.

Skyrim's opening cart scene has become iconic since the game's release ten years ago, but it nearly didn't happen due to a bug that derailed the whole thing… quite literally. 

In this video, Kurt Indovina chats with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim senior world artist Nate Purkeypile about the bee that broke the game's classic intro. In the decade since its release, Skyrim's opening has become synonymous with the meme which spawned "Hey you, you're finally awake.'' For a lot of players, seeing the intro means a new journey through Northern Tamriel awaits, but for Purkeypile, seeing the intro again is a bit of a touchy subject. 

Purkeypile breaks down the story of the mysterious bug that plagued the game's opening cart scene, and the many layers it took to unravel to find the bug and fix it. With Purkeypile, Kurt helps carry the story along, while regaling his own passion for Bethesda's epic fantasy RPG.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition comes out on November 11 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with next-gen upgrades for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.
