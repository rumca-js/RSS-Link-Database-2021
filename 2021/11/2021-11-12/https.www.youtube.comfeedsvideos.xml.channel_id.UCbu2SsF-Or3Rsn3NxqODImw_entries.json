Here\u2019s the best way to use guns, specialists, and tactics to get those data drives and get out alive.\n\nBattlefield 2042 has three main modes: All-Out Warfare, Portal, and Hazard Zone. Hazard Zone is an extraction mode that draws influence from hero shooters, popular battle royale titles, and games like Hunt: Showdown and Escape from Tarkov. In our 12-hour review event, we spent around four hours with the mode and learned a lot. Here\u2019s what you should know.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re giving you 18 things we wish we knew before playing. These tips will help you earn more Dark Market credits, help you develop tactics, cover what kind of guns to purchase at the start of each round, help you survive the extraction process, and more. We\u2019ll also cover how mechanics like the Call-In tablet, plus system, and some specialist abilities work in slightly different ways in this mode, as well as some tactical dos and don\u2019ts.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 is out now in early access with a general release on November 19. The game has cross-progression, cross-play, and cross-buy on PC, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. It's worth noting, though, that matches sport aa lower player count on last-gen consoles.
