Among them are three Ringwraiths, the Mouth of Sauron, and Queen Ber\u00fathiel of Gondor.  They were descended from the King's Men, the large group of N\u00famen\u00f3reans who turned their backs upon the Valor and Elder.\n\nThe Mouth of Sauron would become a lieutenant and emissary of Sauron, the Ringwraiths among his most trusted servants, and Queen Ber\u00fathiel would be among the most mysterious rulers of Men ever.  It is said her 10 cats were used to spy on her behalf - and that she could communicate with them and even read their memories.\n\nBe sure to visit Lord of Maps to see their holiday specials, and use the code NERDOFMAPS at LordofMaps.com to save 15% on your order!\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
