ADD ELEMENTARY'S REMOTE:
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --system appcenter https://flatpak.elementary.io/repo.flatpakrepo

Clips

It's a simple clipboard manager that lets you look at everything you copied in a graphical way.

Planner

The second app here is Planner. It's the best todo list / project management application you can use on Linux, period.

Outliner

It lets you, well, outline, your document, by structuring it with big titles, subtitles, and notes.

Minder

Minder is a mind mapping tool, that lets you create nodes linked to each other.

Norka

A much simpler app, but really useful when you just want to write something without worrying about formatting. It's a continuous text editor, so no pages, no styles, only text, and markdown if you really, really want to add formatting.

Textshine

There's also textshine, it's a very, very powerful text manipualtion utility. It lets you grab or write anything, and then transform it by setting it all to upper case, lowser case, sentence case, titles, camelcase, snake case, whatever case you want.

Frog

The first one is Frog. it's a very simple OCR tool. You just open it, select an area of your screen, and it's going to grab all the text it can read or detect in the image

Resizer

Next is resizer, it's a very simple tool that lets you resize images. You can just open it through your apps menu, and drag any image in there to resize it to the desired dimensions.

Optimizer

Combine it with Optimizer, which automatically optimizes you images to use less space.

Annotator

Next is Annotator, a simple image annotation tool, that can still do a lot. If you don't want to fire up something like Inkscape or GIMP each time you want to mark down a few notes or ideas onto an image, a design proposal, or a simpe screenshot for a bug report, this is your tool.

Ensembles

It's an arranger workstation that lets you play music, arrange a performance, or just improvise with a few pre-recorded styles to give you a beat and a tempo. It has DSP effects, more than 200 bult-in instruments, you can sample sounds to automate your band, and connect to an external MIDI keyboard.

Tuner

Next is Tuner, and it will be a nice addition to the apps library of anyone who likes to discover new music: it lets you browse a huge catalog of web radios, and play them.

Mixer

This next app kinda solves a missing feature of elementary OS, which is that it doesn't really let you control your audio outputs all that much. With Mixer, you can see each app that plays audio, change its volume and balance, and change its output.

Eddy

The first one is Eddy, and it's a graphical .deb package installer. By default, elementary OS doesn't let you install deb packages graphically, and this solves that need. it's simple, straightforward, and heavily recommended on elementary OS.

Pebbles

The default elementary OS calculator is OK, but if you need something more powerful, Pebbles is your new best friend.

Ordne

It's a simple pomodoro timer that you can use to apply that working method.

Fondo
It lets you browse, search, and filter images that you can get as your wallpaper in just one click.
