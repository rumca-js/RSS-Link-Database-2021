Why are bicycles stable? The most common answer is gyroscopic effects, but this is not right. This video was sponsored by Kiwico. Get 50% off your first month of any crate at https://kiwico.com/veritasium50

Huge thanks to Rick Cavallaro for creating this bike on short notice. Thanks to all the friends who participated in the filming. Rick was also responsible for the Blackbird Faster Than The Wind Downwind Cart. https://youtu.be/jyQwgBAaBag 

Much of the information presented here on the stability of a riderless bicycle stems from original research at
  Delft       http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/schwab/Bicycle/
  and
  Cornell  http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/bicycle_mechanics/overview.html

This line of bicycle-balance research was initiated by Jim Papadopoulos:  https://www.nature.com/articles/535338a
