There's a lot you might not know that you can do in Halo Infinite, such as Super Sliding with your handy grapple. We put together a list of advanced tips and tricks to help you gain the extra edge on the battlefield.

Each new weapon and piece of equipment has secret perks and changes the landscape of Halo Infinite's multiplayer. Getting increased grenade distance with Repulsors, launching farther with Grappleshots, and using Threat Sensors and shock weapons as a mobile shock pole are just some of the secrets hidden in the game's engine. As time goes one, more is sure to be uncovered in Halo Infinite's sandbox.

As Jordan Ramée states in the Halo Infinite's Review In Progress, "The multiplayer feels like old-school Halo, but tweaked to better fit the modern FPS playerbase that has fallen in love with shooters that accentuate their solid gunplay with smooth movement and quick-to-deploy abilities."

In today’s GameSpot News, Persia talks about Halo Infinite reaching 200k concurrent players on steam, Warzone’s Secret of the Pacific event, and more. 

Halo Infinite reached more than 200,000 peak concurrent players on Steam recently, and the spike in players is surely attributable in part to the launch of Halo Infinite's first multiplayer event, Fracture: Tenrai, on November 23. The Fracture: Tenrai event adds new cosmetics, a new Fiesta mode which spawns you with a random weapon every life, and more.

Later in the video, Persia covers how Call of Duty: Vanguard will have a few limited-time events for players to bid farewell to Verdansk. Following the ongoing Operation: Flashback event, Secrets of the Pacific is now live. Secrets of the Pacific is described as an event that will grant players vital information on Caldera and its various points of interest prior to the December launch.

Lastly, DICE has restated its commitment to Battlefield 2042 in a recent blog post that it will be "supporting and evolving it for years to come." The post gives a roadmap on planned updates and changes coming to Battlefield 2042, details on updates #2 and #3, and more details about the game's first season in 2022.
