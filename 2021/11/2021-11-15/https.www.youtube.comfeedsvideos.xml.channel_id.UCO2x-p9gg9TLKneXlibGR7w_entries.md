The new MacBook Pro have launched to much fanfare. Gone is the Touch Bar, introduced is the notch, but beyond the visual redesign, we get a look at the Mac's new M1 Pro and M1 Max SoCs. We know from a lot of reviews that the CPUs are very good and very efficient. Battery life on these laptops is excellent while maintaining adequate thermals in a small form factor; however, what nobody has tested extensively is gaming. Apple bragged quite a bit about their performance relative to RTX 3080 Mobile GPUs during their keynote. Of course, this was certainly not in the context of gaming, but.... wait.... could it have been? We show in this video that the 2021 MacBook Pro might just be the best gaming laptops ever made (by accident).
