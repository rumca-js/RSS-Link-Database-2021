Not fully vaccinated, placed in lockdown

Two million, not fully vaccinated, placed in lockdown

Spot checks in public spaces (e1,450)

Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg

We are not taking this step lightly, but unfortunately it is necessary

In reality we have told one third of the population: you will not leave your home apart from for certain reasons

That is a massive reduction in contacts between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated

Initially for 10 days

(Children under 12 and recently recovered exempt)

Prof Eva Schernhammer, Medical University of Vienna

It's already projected that within two weeks we'll have reached the limit

Vaccinations x 4

Australia, Queensland

Ban on unvaccinated, restaurants, pubs, sports events from 17 December

Singapore

Unvaccinated, to pay for their own medical bills from December

Netherlands

Early closing for restaurants and shops, sporting events

ONS

Tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in the week beginning 18 October 2021 (over 18s)

93.1% in England
91.7% in Wales
90.9% in Northern Ireland
92.5% in Scotland 

Vaccination reduced the risk of testing positive during both the Alpha and Delta period

Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech

Reduced the risk of testing positive by,
73% Delta
80% Alpha

Two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca 

Reduced the risk of testing positive by,
62% Delta
76% Alpha

During the Delta period

Two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca provided a similar level of protection from previous natural infection

UK, Health Security Agency

Effectiveness of Pfizer and AZ

In preventing hospitalisations

After the second dose

Aged, 16+

Therefore 12 million UK boosters have been given

Medical workers, over 50s, higher risk individuals

Herd immunity

70% 80% 90%

Original, alpha then delta

Waning immunity

Varying social behaviours

Breakthrough infections and infectivity

Uneven international vaccine roll out

Dr Jefferson Jones

CDC’s COVID-19 Epidemiology Task Force

very complicated

We would discourage thinking in terms of a strict goal

some kind of threshold where there’ll be no more transmission of infections may not be possible

Vaccines, quite effective at preventing severe illness and death,

none has proved reliable at blocking transmission of the virus

Even if vaccination were universal, the coronavirus would probably continue to spread

Dr, Oliver Brooks, CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices

Need to increase vaccine uptake

Jones’ unexpected admission almost makes you less motivated to get more people vaccinated

Dr John Brooks, chief medical officer for the CDC’s COVID-19 response

It’s a science-communications problem

It’s impossible to predict what herd immunity will be in a new pathogen until you reach herd immunity 

CDC, redefine success in terms of new infections and deaths
