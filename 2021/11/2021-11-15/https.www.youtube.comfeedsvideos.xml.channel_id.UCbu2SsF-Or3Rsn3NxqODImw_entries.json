This was, as lead game designer Tymon Smektala explained it, a tamer region meant to allow players to get to grips with the game's melee combat and parkour moves, and come to understand how to manage crowds of infected and survivors alike.\n\nThe first thing I realized when I started to play Dying Light 2 was how fluid the movement felt. Smart changes like faster strafing and back-pedaling, and an always-on sprint ability, make the anti-hero protagonist Aiden Caldwell feel more adept at performing his death-defying feats than Kyle Crane ever was. He's lighter on his feet and animations are smoother, even from the get-go, and despite me seeing some really tantalizing skills not yet unlocked during my play sessions. I especially loved how quickly I was able to intuit whether or not I could make any particular jump. The mechanics are improved across the board and give the controls a faster, more reliable feeling in my hands. \n\n#DyingLight2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pl-MdM1-i4", "date_published": "2021-11-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fortnite X Naruto Shippuden Trailer", "description": "Naruto and Team 7 from Naruto Shippuden join the Fortnite Crew.\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode.
