Khazad-dûm, or Moria, was the greatest dwarf kingdom in the history of Middle-earth.  Today, we cover it's entire history, from its founding by Durin I, to its reclamation by King Durin VII - long after the Return of the King.  It's doors were made by the greatest craftsmen of the Second Age - the dwarf Narvi and the elf lord Celebrimbor.  It would rise to incredible heights until the awakening of the Balrog of Morgoth, Durin's Bane.
