Rockstar's remastered GTA trilogy is, appropriately, an absolute car wreck of creative neglect. Is the Grand Theft Auto: Definitive Edition an ideal way to experience the trilogy? Hell no. 

Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy—Definitive Edition is now available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One and Series X, and Switch.

In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about GTA The Trilogy Definitive Edition patches are coming and original games being reinstated on pc, Halo Infinite Campaign Co-Op and Forge delayed further and Forza Horizon 5 is the biggest Xbox game launch in history. 

In this video, DeVante talks about Rockstar Games releasing a statement apologizing for the ongoing issues with GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition and promising that further updates are coming to improve the experience for everyone. Rockstar also said it will reinstate the original versions of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas on the Rockstar Store in a bundle "shortly." 

DeVante also talks about Microsoft seemingly delaying Halo Infinite’s campaign co-op given that Season 2's start-date is now coming later than expected. Forge was expected to launch after Season 2, so it, too, has seemingly shifted to a later date. Staten said 343 will make announcements in January about Season 2, as well as its plans for campaign co-op and Forge.

Later in the video, Microsoft announced that Forza Horizon 5 enjoyed the "biggest first week" in the history of Xbox, reaching more than 10 million players in that time.

## Halo Infinite Campaign Hands-On Preview

Halo Infinite is a strong start for Master Chief's first open-world outing, and it could bode well for the overall single-player experience.

In the opening moments of Halo Infinite's campaign, a despondent pilot says to Master Chief, "You have one bullet against an entire army, what can you do on your own?" Chief, with all the stoicism that fans have come to love him for, replies in that iconic gravelly voice, "It's enough." 

After a couple of lackluster entries, I've been feeling less and less drawn to the Halo franchise, so it was difficult not to read into that moment. For me, once a diehard fan, Halo Infinite feels like developer 343 Industries' last shot at reinvigorating my fandom. And, based on what I've played of the campaign, it might just be enough.

With Pokémon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl coming to Nintendo Switch, we put Shining Pearl head-to-head with the original Pokémon Diamond on Nintendo DS to see the graphical differences.

Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were originally released for the Nintendo DS in 2006 in Japan and 2007 everywhere else. Now, 10 years later, they’re being remade on the Nintendo Switch as Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the original games and the 25th anniversary of the Pokemon series. 

Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are the 4th generation of Pokemon games and take place in the Sinnoh region with the two cover Pokemon being Dialga and Palkia. For this video the Nintendo DS version of Pokemon Diamond was captured on a New Nintendo 3DS XL at 720p, and Pokemon Shining Pearl was captured on a Nintendo Switch at 1080p.

Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are available now on Nintendo Switch. The games are available separately as well as in a double pack. If you purchase the game before February 21, 2022 you can claim the Pokemon Platinum style outfit for your character as well as a Manaphy Egg through the Mystery Gift function.
