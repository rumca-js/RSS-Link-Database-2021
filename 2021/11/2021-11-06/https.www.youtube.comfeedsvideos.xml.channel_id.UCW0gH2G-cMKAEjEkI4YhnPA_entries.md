Tuor, a man raised by elves, was so great among the people of Gondolin, and such a great instrument of Ulmo, that he would come to be counted among the Eldar.  In this video, we cover his childhood in Dor-lomin, his years in captivity under the Easterlings, and his journeys from Vinyamar, to Gondolin, to the Havens of Sirion, and ultimately, into the West.

Along the way, Tuor plays an important role in the history of Gondolin.  Not only delivering Ulmo's message, but also leading the survivors from the fallen city.  His son, Earendil, would come to fulfill the prophecy of his grandfather - becoming a new star that would give hope to elves and men.
