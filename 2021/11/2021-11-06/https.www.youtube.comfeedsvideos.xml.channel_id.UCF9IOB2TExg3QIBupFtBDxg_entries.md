Protectors from hospitalisation, the story so far.
Oral meds than can be prescribed from home with onset of symptoms

Molnupiravir, approved by MHRA

PFIZER’S NOVEL COVID-19 ORAL ANTIVIRAL TREATMENT CANDIDATE REDUCED RISK OF HOSPITALIZATION OR DEATH BY 89% IN INTERIM ANALYSIS OF PHASE 2/3 EPIC-HR STUDY

https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizers-novel-covid-19-oral-antiviral-treatment-candidate

Public domain data, Pfizer press release

PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332; ritonavir)

Found to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% 

Compared to placebo in non-hospitalized high-risk adults with COVID-19

Through Day 28

PAXLOVID group

No deaths

Placebo group

10 deaths

Pfizer plans to submit the data as part of its ongoing rolling submission to the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as soon as possible

Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) 

Randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, 

who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness 

Scheduled interim analysis

89% reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo

In patients treated within 3 days of symptom onset

PAXLOVID group

0.8% of patients hospitalized

3/389 hospitalized with no deaths

Placebo group

7.0% of patients hospitalized or died

27/385 hospitalized

with 7 subsequent deaths

(p less than 0.0001) 1 in 10,000 chance

In patients treated within 5 days of symptom onset

PAXLOVID group

1.0% of patients hospitalized

6/607 hospitalized with no deaths

Placebo group

6. 7% of patients hospitalized or died

41/612 hospitalized,

with 10 subsequent deaths

p less than 0.0001

At the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee and in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pfizer will cease further enrollment into the study

due to the overwhelming efficacy demonstrated in these results

About the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR Study Interim Analysis

1,219 adults enrolled out of 3,000 planned

North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia

Enrolled individuals had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection

Mild to moderate symptoms

At least one characteristic or underlying medical condition

Randomized (1:1) to receive PAXLOVID™ or placebo orally every 12 hours for five days

About the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR Study Safety Data

Safety data, n = 1881

Treatment-emergent adverse events

PAXLOVID™group

 19%

Placebo group

21%

Most of which were mild in intensity

Fewer serious adverse events

PAXLOVID™group

 1.7%

Placebo group

6.6%

Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events

PAXLOVID™group

2.1%

Placebo group

4.1%

Pharmacology

Specifically designed SARS-CoV-2-3CL protease inhibitor,

an enzyme that the coronavirus needs to replicate

Co-administration with a low dose of ritonavir helps slow the metabolism of PF-07321332

PF-07321332 inhibits viral replication at a stage known as proteolysis, 

which occurs before viral RNA replication

In preclinical studies, PF-07321332 did not demonstrate evidence of mutagenic DNA interactions.

EPIC-SR includes a cohort of vaccinated patients who have an acute breakthrough symptomatic COVID-19 infection and who have risk factors for severe illness.

Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer’s vaccine trial, 
Revelations of poor practices at a contract research company
https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635

Pfizer’s pivotal covid-19 vaccine trial, 

raise questions about data integrity and regulatory oversight

This was the original paper

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577

 Autumn 2020

Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, Albert Bourla

As I’ve said before, we are operating at the speed of science

Ventavia Research Group

https://www.ventaviaresearch.com

Researchers were testing Pfizer’s vaccine at several sites in Texas

A regional director, Brook Jackson has told The BMJ that the company

falsified data

unblinded patients

employed inadequately trained vaccinators

was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial

Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding. 

US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were informed

Ventavia fired her later the same day. 

The BMJ has been provided with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails.

She repeatedly informed her superiors

poor laboratory management

patient safety concerns

data integrity issues

that drug assignment confirmation printouts were being left in participants’ charts, accessible to blinded personnel (later corrected)

company wasn’t able to quantify the types and number of errors they were finding when examining the trial paperwork for quality control

ICON, the contract research organisation

ICON then highlighted over 100 outstanding queries older than three days

Worries over FDA inspection

Concerns raised

Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff

Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events

Protocol deviations not being reported

Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures

Mislabelled laboratory specimens

Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.

FDA advisory committee meeting held on 10 December 2020

Problems at Ventavia not mentioned

The next day the FDA issued the authorisation of the vaccine
 
In August this year, after full FDA approval of Pfizer’s vaccine

FDA published that 9 of the trials 153 sites were inspected

FDA, full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-19

Other employees’ accounts

everything that you complained about was spot on

Two former Ventavia employees spoke to The BMJ anonymously for fear of reprisal and loss of job prospects in the tightly knit research community

I don’t think it was good clean data

It’s a crazy mess

Pfizer has hired Ventavia as a research subcontractor on four other vaccine clinical trials

covid-19 vaccine in children and young adults

pregnant women

a booster dose

an RSV vaccine trial

NCT04816643,  NCT04754594,  NCT04955626,  NCT05035212).
