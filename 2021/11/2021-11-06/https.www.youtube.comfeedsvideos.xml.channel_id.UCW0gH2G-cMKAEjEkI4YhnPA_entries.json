In this video, we cover his childhood in Dor-lomin, his years in captivity under the Easterlings, and his journeys from Vinyamar, to Gondolin, to the Havens of Sirion, and ultimately, into the West.\n\nAlong the way, Tuor plays an important role in the history of Gondolin.  Not only delivering Ulmo's message, but also leading the survivors from the fallen city.  His son, Earendil, would come to fulfill the prophecy of his grandfather - becoming a new star that would give hope to elves and men.\n\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
