Basically, we need to change the vaccine administration guidelines to include precautionary aspiration, prior to pushing in the vaccine. This will prevent cases of inadvertent intravascular administration of vaccine.

Here is some discussion to suggest inadvertent intravascular vaccine administration is a variable in the aetiology of complications after adenoviral vector vaccine administration and after mRNA vaccines.

These adverse events, although rare have reduced public confidence in covid vaccination, especially amongst the young, where vaccine rates are lowest.

It has long been known that intravenous injection of adenovirus leads to TTS in mice

https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/109/7/2832/125650/Adenovirus-induced-thrombocytopenia-the-role-of

Now, new covid vaccine specific work agrees with this previous work

Thrombocytopenia and splenic platelet directed immune responses after intravenous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration (29th June 2021)

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.29.450356v1

The authors conclude, ‘Our work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS.’ 

‘We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation.’ 

‘Hence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.’

Also after giving mRNA vaccines

A new study finds that giving mice intravenous mRNA vaccine also causes heart inflammation in mice. 

Intravenous Injection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccine Can Induce Acute Myopericarditis in Mouse Model (August 2021)

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab707/6353927

‘Our study indicates that IV injection of vaccines might partially contribute to this clinical phenotype, thus warranting a reconsideration of the practice of IM injection without aspiration, which carries the risk of inadvertent IV injection.’ 

Agreement from ‘fact check’ from Leo Nicolai, Cardiology Fellow, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich:

(German Centre for Cardiovascular Research)

https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/incorrect-vaccine-administration-is-a-potential-cause-of-post-vaccine-adverse-effects-but-more-research-is-still-needed-to-confirm-or-reject-this-hypothesis/?fbclid=IwAR0nBbM6v0V2WPFn4LxIdfR4FNAvIzLGKhzFPdQPG8mu_FR1InB8OzYQgMc

‘Indeed, there is peer-reviewed work showing in mice that possibly intravenous injection of mRNA vaccine leads to myocardial inflammation.’

‘that intravenous injection of adenoviral vector based vaccine (AZ1222, ChAdOx1) leads to thrombocytopenia and platelet-directed immune responses, offering a possible explanation for vaccine-induced thrombosis/thrombocytopenia’

‘these data might indicate a simple measure to lower the incidence of vaccine-induced side effects,’

‘There is a lack of data on frequency and effects of IV injection in humans.’

Denmark has changed their national guidelines

Based on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before injection.

Booster doses probably needed by most people, unfortunately.

US, 20.6 million so far

Six months after 2nd shot

65 years and older

50–64 years with underlying medical conditions

18 – 64 years, working / living in high-risk settings

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114255?

July 30, 2021, over 602

Third (booster) dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine was approved

60 years or older who had been fully vaccinated

August 29th, anyone over 12

At least five months previously

N = 1,144,690

2 dynamic cohorts

2 vaccines only

N = 5.2 million person days

4,439 confirmed infections

294 cases of severe covid
(based on 4.6 million person days)

2 vaccines + booster

N = 10.6 million person days

934 confirmed infections

29 cases of severe COVID-19
(based on 6.3 million person days)

(despite older demographic)

Twelve days or more after the booster dose

Increases antibody neutralization levels ~10-fold compared to after 2nd dose

11.3 fold decrease in the relative risk of confirmed infection

Efficacy among booster recipients to approximately 95%

(May have waned to 50% with time and delta variant)

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262423v1

19.5 fold decrease in the relative risk of severe illness

Factor reduction in reduced rate of confirmed infection in boosted versus none-boosted

In conjunction with safety reports

this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a third vaccine dose,

in both reducing transmission and severe disease,

indicates the great potential of curtailing the Delta variant resurgence by administering booster shots

Decline in immunity, UK data

Protection against symptomatic disease, Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine  

65%, up to 3 months after the second dose

45% 6 months after the second dose

Protection against symptomatic disease, Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine

90% up to 3 months after 2nd dose

65% 6 months after the second dose

Protection against hospitalisation, Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine 

95% at 3 months

75% at 6 months 

Protection against hospitalisation, Pfizer/BioNTech

99% at 3 months

90% at 6 months

Why this is important

A small change can generate a major shift in hospital admissions

A change from 95% to 90% against hospitalisation would lead to doubling of admissions in those vaccinated

Early UK booster results from Pfizer

Booster restores protection back up to 

95.6% against symptomatic infection

Booster doses, Situation in UK

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/over-eight-million-people-in-the-uk-receive-covid-19-booster-jabs

8,115,229 boosted so far

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-booster-vaccine/

Booster vaccine doses, available on the NHS

People most at risk from COVID-19,

who have had a 2nd dose of a vaccine at least 6 months ago

(after 5 months for high risk groups)

This includes:

Aged 50 and over

Frontline health / care workers

16 and over with a health condition

16 and over, carers or live with venerable people

Pregnant women in eligible groups

COVID-19 booster vaccine and flu vaccine

If you are offered both vaccines, it's safe to have them at the same time.
