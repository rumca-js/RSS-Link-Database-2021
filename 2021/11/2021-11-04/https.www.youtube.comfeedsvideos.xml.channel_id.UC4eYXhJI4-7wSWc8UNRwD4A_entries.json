Like going half on a store-bought rotisserie chicken. \"With mashed potatoes and cornbread,\" Kal adds.\n\n\"On God,\" Isaiah chimes in.\n\nIf Top Dawg thought there'd be fringe benefits to linking the Tennessee and Texas natives, he was right. They became fast homies before making even a lick of music together. That foundation was crucial. Cause when the music finally did come it needed to cut through everything blocking Isaiah Rashad's blessings.\n\nReleased last July, \"The House Is Burning\" could be interpreted as a metaphor for planet Earth's hot mess and Isaiah's own inner demons. To survive it all, Isaiah had to battle through rehab, writer's block and three months of refuge spent on Kal Banx's couch while his pockets were on E.\n\nMaybe by necessity, Kal became more than a star beatmaker. Studio sessions commenced only after he led Isaiah on silly diversions down the weirdest rabbit holes of YouTube. Laughing became existential. It helped Isaiah get out of his head, and get everything in his head committed to tape. On \"Hey Mista,\" one of several songs Banx produced or co-produced on the album, he cut and pasted bars freestyled by Zay into two verses and a bridge. And he took additional music cues from Isaiah to make beats that tapped into Zay's old soul.\n\nTogether, in the funniest sit-down of the new season of The Formula, they walk us through the making of the song that lit the spark for the album. In the process, they reveal how the best artist-producer collaborations work a lot like life \u2014 with real friends to distract us from, and soundtrack us through, all our drama.\n\nCREDITS\nHost/Series Producer: Rodney Carmichael; Producers: Tsering Bista, Nickolai Hammar; Editor: Annabel Edwards; Art Director/Animator: CJ Riculan; Animators: Jackie Lay, Alicia Zheng; Director of Photography: Nickolai Hammar; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Jack Corbett, Nickolai Hammar, Alicia Zheng; Production Assistant: Amna Ijaz; Project Coordinator: Erin Register; Legal Adviser: Kimberly Sullivan; Consulting Editors: Jacob Ganz, Sidney Madden; Supervising Producer, Nick Michael; Senior Producer: Abby O'Neill; Managing Editor: Becky Lettenberger; Executive Producers: Anya Grundmann, Keith Jenkins; Special Thanks: Hardpink Studio and Staff\n\nMUSIC\n\"Hey Mista,\" Isaiah Rashad, The House Is Burning (2021); \"Rose Water\" by DJ Face\n\n#isaiahrashad #kalbanx #theformula #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpeVQnwyxEc", "date_published": "2021-11-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tems: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | November 4, 2021\nFrom an elegant performance space in Lagos, Nigeria, Temilade Openiyi, aka Tems, adorns hues that recall the title of her latest EP, If Orange Was a Place. As she slips into performance mode, emoting with her eyelids drooped slightly, she begins \"Found\" in her upper register before switching to that unmistakably rich alto range. That's when the magic starts.\n\nHer music aligns perfectly with the Tiny Desk aesthetic: Everything is stripped away to reveal the feels. Over the past couple of years, the Nigerian singer's star has been on a steady ascent, beginning with the release of her first couple of singles, \"Try Me\" and \"Mr. Rebel.\" \"Damages\" (performed here) was huge in Nigeria and helped put her name on the U.S. map. That slow and steady approach led to features on two huge international hits: Drake's \"Fountains,\" one of the standouts on Certified Lover Boy, and \"Essence\" by Wizkid featuring ahem ... starring Tems. Originally released last year, the latter was arguably the song of this summer (ask anyone who braved the nightclubs in 2021). Those two jams served as a gateway to what's becoming a substantial discography, and her Tiny Desk setlist tacitly implies, \"I know you love those songs and you'll love these, too.\" She's right.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Found\"\n\"Free Mind\"\n\"Looku Looku\"\n\"Replay\"\n\"Damages\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTems: vocals\nNsikak David: guitar\nAfolabi Adekomaiya: drums\nObinna Enwere: keys\nAyo Dele Owa: bass\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: ua.x\nProducer: Ebuka Nwobu.\nProduction Manager: Chisom Nwobu\nDOP: FEDWORKS\nArt Director: Desola Falomo\nAssociate Producers: Kenechukwu Nwobu, Adedamola Adetunji\nGaffer: Ekene Ucheonwu\nCamera Operators: Gbolahan Inaolaji Quam, Folarin Oludare\nLocation Manager: Debo Johnson\nCamera Assistants: Tobi Oloko\nEditor: uaxstudio\nColorist: Eduvie 'Stedi' Emojevwe\nProduction Company: uaxstudio + Ladder, Lex & Booker\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #tems", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXI7NP7TDCw", "date_published": "2021-11-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
