 If you’ve been a fan for long, you’ll recognize Loren Battley immediately. She’s been singing stellar background vocals with Pomplamoose for years! And when she isn’t on tour with Michael Bublé (flex), she writes and produces her own music. More on that later...for now, here’s Willow’s “Transparent Soul” with Loren Battley on lead vocals.

LYRICS
I don't fucking know if it's a lie or it's a fact
All your little fake friends will sell your secrets for some cash
Smile in my face, then put your cig' out on my back
If you ever see me, just get to runnin' like The Flash

I knew a boy just like you
He's a snake, just like you
Such a fake, just like you
But I can see the truth

Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know

I don't fucking know if it's paradise or it's a trap
Yeah, they're treating me like royalty, but is it kissin' ass?
No one's brave enough to take the fall right
But it's all your fault
Why you actin' like it's alright?

I knew a girl just like you
She was vain, just like you
Such a pain, just like you
And everybody knows the truth

Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know

It's clear to me now
You're scared of me, wow
It's clear to me now (transparent soul)
It's clear to me now
You're scared of me, wow
It's clear to me now (transparent soul)

Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
