Call of Duty: Vanguard launches with 20 multiplayer maps, three of which are actually remakes from 2008's Call of Duty: World at War. Let's take a look at how the maps have changed with this side-by-side comparison.

Timestamps:
00:00 - Intro
00:16 - Castle Map
02:17 - Dome Map
03:27 - Sub Pens Map

Call of Duty: Vanguard launched on November 5th with the most multiplayer maps to date. Within these 20 maps lie a few remakes from Call of Duty's past, specifically from 2008's Call of Duty World at War. In this video we'll be taking a look back at the original maps and see how they compare to their remade counterparts 13 years later.

We begin with the fan-favorite "Castle" map. The medium sized battlefield was remembered for its few key elevation spots, as well as multiple routes that cut through the center as well as it's hectic west area where its stone stairs were a memorable hotspot. Next is the wildly popular "Dome". This small map was the "Nuketown" before the release of Black Ops 1. Its imamate, square design made battles here a cluster, no matter the player count. Lastly, the Sub Pens made was remade for both multiplayer as well as campaign. Featured early on in the "Phoenix" mission, this map has seen the most changes in it's redesign.

Call of Duty Vanguard is finally here! Stay tuned to GameSpot for continued coverage on this year's COD including gameplay, livestreams, and updates on Warzone's new Pacific map Caldera coming soon.

Tweaks in multiplayer and Zombies advance the Call of Duty franchise overall, and an emphasis on distinct characters makes Vanguard's story fun, but it doesn't always mix well with the series' gameplay.
