Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news. Sorry guys I had a hard time getting this one out. A lot happened and I still wanted to do a recap of Oculus, I mean, Facebook, I mean Meta Connect. So here's everything that happened and here is also a recap of V34, HP's refreshed Reverb, and some interesting words from Jason Rubin. Oh and project cambria. Plus Oculus as a name is practically done.
