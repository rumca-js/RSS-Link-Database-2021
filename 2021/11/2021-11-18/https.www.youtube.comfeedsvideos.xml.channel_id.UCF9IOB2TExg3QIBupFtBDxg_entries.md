No country can simply vaccinate its way out of the pandemic

Its not vaccine ‘or’

Its vaccines ‘and’

It makes no sense to give boosters to healthy adults

(when high risk around the world are still wating for their first dose)

Every day there are 6 times more booster doses administered than primary doses in poorer countries

This is a scandal that must stop now

Food and Drug Administration

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/index.html

Amended the emergency use authorizations (EUA) for Moderna and Pfizer

Moderna (half of the primary dose)

A single booster dose for all 18 and older

Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock

helps to provide continued protection against COVID-19, 

including the serious consequences that can occur, 

such as hospitalization and death

At least six months after primary vaccination series

At least two months after Janssen

Data Supporting Effectiveness

Moderna, FDA analysis

Study group
N= 149 from the original clinical studies who received a booster

Controls group
N = 1,055 two-dose series

Result
The antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus 29 days after a booster dose of the vaccine demonstrated a booster response. 

Pfizer-BioNTech

Study group
N= 200 who received a booster

Controls group
Same people, one month after the two-dose primary series

Result
The antibody response demonstrated a booster response.

FDA Evaluation of Benefits and Risks

Additional real-world data,

on the recently increasing number of cases of COVID-19 in the U.S.

and on the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination

The FDA has determined that the benefits of a single booster dose of either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines

outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis

in individuals age 18 years of age and older

Both Pfizer and Moderna are conducting post-authorization/post-marketing studies

to assess known serious risks of myocarditis and pericarditis. 

FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety

Most commonly reported side effects after a booster

Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site

Fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain and chills

Swollen lymph nodes in the underarm, more frequently following the booster

Austria

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/11/19/covid-news-coronavirus-lockdown-europe-cases-deaths-booster/

First European country to go back into full lockdown

Whole country, hard lockdown, 10 – 20 days, from Monday

Restaurants, pubs, all non-essential shops closed

People told to remain at home

Classroom teaching suspended

First European country to make Covid vaccination compulsory

From Feb. 1

Heavy fines

Large anti-vaxxer movement

65% fully vaccinated

Zoe update

Study incidence, 65,059 new daily symptomatic cases 

Based on PCR and LFT test data from UK, 
n = 40,442

Infections down 10% on the week

The UK R, around 0.9 and regional

Scotland, R is 1

Prevalence UK

On average 1 in 67 people in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID

Professor Tim Spector

In terms of what it means for Christmas, I’m cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year. 

It’s becoming clear that children and the school holidays play a key role in the waves of infection. 

I think it’s safe to say that we can expect to see another rise in the new year after the holidays. 

I think we’ll be dealing with COVID for the next five years

However, the most important thing we can all do is to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible. 

we need to redefine fully vaccinated as three doses to protect us all from Delta and the inevitable new variants of COVID yet to come

Netherlands

National Institute for Health (RIVM)

Infections up 44% on the week

Strongest rise, 4-12

Immunologist Ger Rijkers

Keeping primary schools closed for longer is an effective way to keep the virus under control

Children are virus factories and infect adults as well as each other

Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)

Children who have had Covid should wait three months to get vaccine

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukhsa-updates-clinical-guidance-on-vaccinations-for-12-to-17-year-olds

based on the emerging evidence from the UK and other countries, 

which suggests that leaving a longer interval between infection and vaccination may further reduce 

the already small risk of myocarditis in younger age groups

If younger people experience any of the following symptoms after receiving their vaccination, they should call 111 or see their GP:

• pain and/or tightness in the chest which may spread across the body

• pain in the neck that may spread across the shoulders and/or arms

• shortness of breath when lightly exercising or walking

• difficulty breathing when resting or feeling light-headed

• flu-like symptoms such as a high temperature, tiredness and fatigue

• palpitations or an abnormal heart rhythm

• feeling like you need to be sick

We are going to have a really terrible Christmas if we don’t take countermeasures now
