About Mat and Savanna Shaw 
They are a daddy-daughter duo from Utah that rose to prominence during the COVID-19 quarantine. Savanna, eager to keep in touch with her music friends, started a music social media account. Normally a shy and private teenager, she was nervous to sing her first song by herself, so she asked her dad to join her in singing “The Prayer.”

After that video went viral, Mat and Savanna continued releasing duets on social media and streaming platforms, with singles charting in both the US and UK. They quickly garnered a worldwide following resulting in over a half million YouTube subscribers. In October of 2020, their first album “Picture This” debuted at #1 on the iTunes Pop Chart. They have since taken the #1 spot on multiple Billboard music charts. Kelly Clarkson called them “incredibly gifted” and Good Morning America said, “this father-daughter duo’s music is bringing hope.”

About The Piano Guys:
Paul, a Yamaha dealer who dabbled in videography, Jon, a professional pianist, Al, a music producer and studio engineer, and Steve, a cellist with a creative superpower called ADHD, all serendipitously joined forces to create the most successful YouTube instrumental music group in history. The Piano Guys’ mission is to inspire and spread hope through incomparably imaginative piano music videos filmed all over the world. On this channel you can regularly find piano covers of music from genres like top 40, pop, classic rock, R&B, hiphop, country, and more. Make sure to subscribe and enable all post notifications.
