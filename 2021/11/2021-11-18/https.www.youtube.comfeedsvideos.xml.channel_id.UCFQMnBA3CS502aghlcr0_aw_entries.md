If you care about livestreaming, broadcasting, it's important to support actually innovative companies. As discovered this week, one of the most popular companies, Streamlabs has been taking IP routinely from other companies and pushing it as their own. Not only that, their affilated company "VULCUN" was caught in a bunch of scandals that shed an even worse light on the company. This is not something I want to personally support. For those who want to know how to switch over from STREAMLABS to alternatives, follow EposVox on youtube, he has a bunch of tutorials.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
