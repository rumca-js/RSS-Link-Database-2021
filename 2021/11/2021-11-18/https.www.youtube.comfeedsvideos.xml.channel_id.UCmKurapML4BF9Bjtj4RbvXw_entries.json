Savanna, eager to keep in touch with her music friends, started a music social media account. Normally a shy and private teenager, she was nervous to sing her first song by herself, so she asked her dad to join her in singing \u201cThe Prayer.\u201d\n\nAfter that video went viral, Mat and Savanna continued releasing duets on social media and streaming platforms, with singles charting in both the US and UK. They quickly garnered a worldwide following resulting in over a half million YouTube subscribers. In October of 2020, their first album \u201cPicture This\u201d debuted at #1 on the iTunes Pop Chart. They have since taken the #1 spot on multiple Billboard music charts. Kelly Clarkson called them \u201cincredibly gifted\u201d and Good Morning America said, \u201cthis father-daughter duo\u2019s music is bringing hope.\u201d\n\nAbout The Piano Guys:\nPaul, a Yamaha dealer who dabbled in videography, Jon, a professional pianist, Al, a music producer and studio engineer, and Steve, a cellist with a creative superpower called ADHD, all serendipitously joined forces to create the most successful YouTube instrumental music group in history. The Piano Guys\u2019 mission is to inspire and spread hope through incomparably imaginative piano music videos filmed all over the world.
