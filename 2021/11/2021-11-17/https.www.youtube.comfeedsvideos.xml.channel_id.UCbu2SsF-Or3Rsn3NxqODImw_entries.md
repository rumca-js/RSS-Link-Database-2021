Grand Theft Auto’s Definitive Trilogy collection has had a bumpy start into the next generation of gaming. Here’s our list of issues that could use some love to make the experience as smooth and as fun as it was more than a decade ago.

Grand Theft Auto's Definitive Trilogy collection has had a bit of a bumpy start. It's suffering from graphical, audio and gameplay issues across all three titles. In this video Richie Bracamonte breaks down six things Rockstar and Grove Street Games can do to help makes these games as awesome as we remember them. (And more!)

Most of the definitive editions issues seemed to be overlooked as the trilogy transitioned into the Unreal engine. This include old transparency effects, terrifying character models and lighting effects. Other issues didn't occur before, such as de-synched audio, music tracks skipping and problems with aiming, including a glitchy animation for Tommy Verceti when crouched. The  exaggerated rain effect has also made it hard to drive, especially in first-person view. While there appear to big little in the way of game-breaking issues, small upgrades can be made to enhance the general quality of life and gameplay experience. The modding community has already begun making changes, but also have been dealing with Rockstar and Take-Two studios every step of the way.

DeVante also talks about how Developer 343 Industries is making major changes to the game's battle pass progression system in the wake of a wave of negative feedback about it. These changes include: Halo Infinite players can now earn XP by completing matchmade games. The "Play 1 Game" Daily Challenge is worth 50 XP each.

In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Battlefield 2042’s rubber banding issues being investigated by DICE, Saints Row Reboot being delayed to August 2022 and shareholders calling for Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick to resign.

In this video, DeVante talks about DICE investigating Battlefield 2042’s rubber banding issues. Rubber banding results in players snapping between two positions on a map, hence the name. It stems from high latency or packet loss, as a player's position in-game desynchronizes with the location the game server has them in.

DeVante also talks about the Saints Row reboot being delayed. Originally scheduled for release on February 25, 2022, the game is now launching six months later, on August 23, 2022.  

Later in the video, shareholders call for Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick to resign following a report that he knew of misconduct at the company.
