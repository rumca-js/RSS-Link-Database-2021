Hoffman investigates how and why the standards and laws around Salmonella have failed to keep up with the increasing danger posed by some strains of the bacteria.The film looks closely at one of the largest Salmonella poultry outbreaks on record, when chicken from Foster Farms sickened more than 600 people over 16 months. Delving into the complex world of food safety, the investigation reveals a seeming contradiction: even though hundreds of people were falling ill, Foster Farms was still meeting the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) standards for Salmonella contamination.\n\nLove FRONTLINE?
