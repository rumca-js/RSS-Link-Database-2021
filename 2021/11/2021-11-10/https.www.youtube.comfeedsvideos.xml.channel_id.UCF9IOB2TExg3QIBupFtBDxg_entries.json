Ivermectin binds to this enzyme and disrupts it.\n\nBut the same is true of  PF-07321332\n\nExploring the Binding Mechanism of PF-07321332 SARS-CoV-2 Protease Inhibitor through Molecular Dynamics and Binding Free Energy Simulations (20th August 2021)\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34502033/\n\nThe crystal structure of 3CLpro in complex with PF-07321332, lopinavir, and ritonavir is not yet available.

It will be the \u2018new\u2019 treatment for C. in pill form,\u201d \n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has warned people against self-medicating with easier-to-access formulations of ivermectin for livestock, which are highly concentrated and also may include other ingredients that have not been tested in people. \n\nAs a result, there is no basis for claiming that either the Pfizer or Merck drugs are similar to ivermectin in any way.\n\nPfizer also denies any connection. \u201cPfizer\u2019s protease inhibitor is not similar to that of an animal medicine and is not the same mechanism,\u201d a company spokesperson said in an email\n\nThat post uses the phrase \u201cPfizermectin,\u201d \n\nEditor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \n\nFinal fact\nFluvoxamine also has 3 fluorine atoms as does PF-07321332", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObTAOvgd_JE", "date_published": "2021-11-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Pericarditis after vaccine", "description": "Kyle's statement before US Senate expert panel on federal vaccine mandates and vaccine injuries\nKyle starts at 53 minutes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lepqvdXoA2E\n\nOur previous video with Kyle\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7inaTiDKaU\n\nDr Patterson video\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=486953922413886\n\nKyle's YouTube channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/KyleAprilRideMtb", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rZZTPp-eYU", "date_published": "2021-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
