If you can talk to anybody who is still alive, it's like you got a great film. And that is the case with this.\n\n\"Todd Haynes obviously doesn't want to capture like a definitive version of VU, which maybe there isn't one,\" Mary continues. \"But there's a lot of footage that I'd never seen before that still exists that clearly he got his hands on, which is great. And then the interviews with everyone are truly amazing.\"\n\nWatch more of what Mary Lucia has to say in the video above. \n\nCheck out the complete Listen to Looch playlist:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYClJc3TpV5J_sXyCfes-p6vCgOpCmleh\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/ \n\n#marylucia #toddhaynes #thevelvetunderground", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbufUxDbkg", "date_published": "2021-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
