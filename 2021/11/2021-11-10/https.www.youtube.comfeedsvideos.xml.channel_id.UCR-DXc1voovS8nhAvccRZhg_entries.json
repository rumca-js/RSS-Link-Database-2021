A Raspberry Pi Linux Tablet that works!", "description": "The CutiePi is the first Raspberry Pi-based tablet I've used that I'd actually consider a 'tablet'. It's no iPad, but it is a fun and durable tablet with a little bit of fun in the form of a handle that doubles as a stand.\n\nIs it a tablet for everyone? No. But it does have its uses, and it gives you a full open source hardware Linux tablet that can run a variety of systems, including CutiePi's own Shell UI.\n\nLinks, links, and more links (some are affiliate links):\n\n  - CutiePi: https://cutiepi.io\n  - 8BitDo N30 Pro2 Bluetooth controller: https://amzn.to/3wqVYpk\n  - My Pi Rack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87lAQtML2FQ\n  - Pi Zero 2 Null 2 review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zu3pjvdSHI\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\nMerch: https://redshirtjeff.com\n\n#RaspberryPi #CutiePi\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - This is CutiePi\n01:06 - CutiePi Walkthrough\n03:17 - CutiePi Shell UI\n07:51 - Testing YouTube playback\n09:25 - Portable Use and Battery Life\n11:22 - Drawing responsiveness\n11:47 - RetroPie gaming test\n16:17 - iPad replacement?\n17:30 - Teardown\n22:46 - Open Source Hardware\n23:23 - Shipping delays and getting it finished\n25:37 - My thoughts and gaffes", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ZQ9LRdXSk", "date_published": "2021-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
