Two years ago today — Nov. 10, 2019 — a session that Tyler Childers recorded in The Current studio featured on United States of Americana with Bill DeVille.

At the time, Childers' latest album, "Country Squire," had debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top Country Albums and American/Folk Albums charts. "I was pretty proud of it, man, and it meant a lot," Childers said of the debut. "I put a lot of time and a lot of effort into it, and for people to take a liking to it and put it there, that was really cool."

Watch two performances by Childers and his band from that 2019 session. And roots music lovers: keep your ears peeled for a "Wildwood Flower" quotation that Childers slips seamlessly into the outro of "Lady May."

## Listen to Looch: talking about Todd Haynes's 'The Velvet Underground'

This week, Mary Lucia talks about Todd Haynes's documentary, 'The Velvet Underground,' which is streaming now on Apple TV.  

"Haynes is very much involved in music and documenting music and making interesting films," Mary says. "With the Velvet Underground, it seems like a no brainer. If you can talk to anybody who is still alive, it's like you got a great film. And that is the case with this.

"Todd Haynes obviously doesn't want to capture like a definitive version of VU, which maybe there isn't one," Mary continues. "But there's a lot of footage that I'd never seen before that still exists that clearly he got his hands on, which is great. And then the interviews with everyone are truly amazing."

Watch more of what Mary Lucia has to say in the video above.
