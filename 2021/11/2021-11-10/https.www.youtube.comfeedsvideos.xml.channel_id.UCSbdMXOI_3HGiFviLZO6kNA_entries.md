Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news! Today I talk about Valve and Open BCI's Project Galea, all of the crazy AR news this week, The Quest 2's (up to) 70% performance boost, reveal merch, and a bunch more! Sorry it's late again, this week has been extremely stressful, hoping to get back on track soon.
