Doctors 3D-print customized implants and even medication with individual dosage needs. Rapid prototyping has relied on 3D printing for a decade now. There\u2019s this themed restaurant in London where everything, from chairs through cutlery and even food is printed from scratch. Recently, hobbyists and enthusiasts held a national competition for 3D-printed guns. First startups are popping up with promising technology to print affordable housing faster, cheaper and more sustainably. \n\n3D printers aren\u2019t going to replace machines in traditional manufacturing. They\u2019ll be their excellent companion. Bringing the best of the both worlds and eliminating their drawbacks. 3D printers can excel at customization and decentralizing the supply chain, while subtractive manufacturing can mass-produce at scale at low cost. We probably shouldn\u2019t hope for 3D printing to be able to do more than that. But that might be more than enough.\n\nSources\n\nAbout 3D printing in general\nhttps://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/introduction-to-3d-printing-history-processes-and-market-growth/\nFilaments\nhttps://all3dp.com/1/3d-printer-filament-types-3d-printing-3d-filament/\nPoly-lactic acid (popular 3D printing filament)\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/polylactic-acid\nABS (filament)\n https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene\n\nHealth Care\nFDA approved drug\nhttps://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/cder-researchers-explore-promise-and-potential-3d-printed-pharmaceuticals\nhttps://www.computerworld.com/article/3048823/this-is-the-first-3d-printed-drug-to-win-fda-approval.html\n\u2192 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG8N9ddst7M\nMedical applications\nhttps://www.raise3d.com/academy/how-is-3d-printing-used-in-the-medical-industry/\n3D printed valves\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51911070\nWindpipe support\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/03/17/289042381/doctors-use-3-d-printing-to-help-a-baby-breathe/\nEars\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/02/20/172493174/print-me-an-ear-3-d-printing-tackles-human-cartilage\nBioprinting\nhttps://www.engineering.com/story/engineering-ourselves-the-future-potential-power-of-3d-bioprinting\nTitanium implants\nhttps://redshift.autodesk.com/3d-printed-titanium/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2015/09/19/how-surgeons-implanted-3d-printed-titanium-ribs-in-a-cancer-patient/\n\u2192 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt0CiUDVPHk\nhttps://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/young-woman-receives-3d-printed-titanium-skull-implant/\nhttps://3dprint.com/70401/3d-printed-skull-implant/\nCancer patient's implants\nhttps://www.3ders.org/articles/20160413-64-year-old-israeli-cancer-patient-receives-3d-printed-jaw-implant.html\n\nDecentralization & supply chain\nShortages\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/business/coronavirus-global-shortages.html \nNovena open-hardware laptop\nhttps://www.wired.com/2014/04/novena/\nhttps://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/novena\nHome fabrication\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10922-desktop-fabricator-may-kick-start-home-revolution/\nSmartphone sales\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/263437/global-smartphone-sales-to-end-users-since-2007/\n3D printing solutions to shortages\nhttps://www.tctmagazine.com/is-3d-printing-magic-bullet-supply-chain-covid-19/\nSemiconductors\nhttps://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/3d-printing-may-ease-semiconductor-shortage-woes/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jimvinoski/2021/06/15/can-3d-printing-help-solve-our-chip-shortage/\nhttps://www.tctmagazine.com/additive-manufacturing-3d-printing-industry-insights/technology-insights/chips-challenge-3d-printing-semiconductor-shortage/\n\n3D printing tank parts\nhttps://www.popsci.com/military/army-3d-prints-tank-part-during-exercise/\n\nHousing and construction\nhttps://inhabitat.com/worlds-largest-3d-printed-building-made-from-powdered-cement-unveiled-at-uc-berkeley/\nhttps://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/03/06/researchers-at-uc-berkeley-create-bloom-first-ever-3-d-printed-cement-structure-that-stands-9-feet-tall/\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/18/business/california-3d-printed-neighborhood-trnd/index.html\nhttps://www.dwell.com/article/worlds-largest-3d-printed-building-apis-cor-6a4b7f45\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/texas-to-get-100-3d-printed-homes-as-builders-seek-to-solve-worker-shortages/\n\n3D printed guns\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/local/weapons-made-with-3-d-printers-could-test-gun-control-efforts/2013/02/18/9ad8b45e-779b-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html?\n3D printed food\nhttps://www.ge.com/additive/additive-manufacturing/industries/food-beverage", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APyQddFHaXs", "date_published": "2021-11-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
