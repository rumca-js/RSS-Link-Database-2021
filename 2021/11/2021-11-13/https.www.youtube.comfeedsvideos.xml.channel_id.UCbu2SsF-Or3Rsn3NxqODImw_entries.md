From Infinity Ward's original Call of Duty to Sledgehammer's latest, Call of Duty: Vanguard, we chart the history of the World War II Call of Duty games.

From wars in the past, wars in the present, and even wars in the far-flung future, Call of Duty has been there. But the juggernaut franchise first made its mark with one of the biggest events of the 20th Century: WW2, an era it has revisited multiple times over the years since, including its latest entry, Call of Duty: Vanguard.

In the above video, we chronicle the Call of Duty games that explore World War II (from the first in the series, created by Infinity Ward), the introduction of the Zombies mode to those games, and how the latest WW2 CoD game, Vanguard, ties into the battle royale-focused Call of Duty: Warzone. 

For more on Call of Duty, make sure to check out our latest episode of Firearms Expert Reacts, where Jonathan Ferguson breaks down the WW2 weapons in the game. Make sure to subscribe at youtube.com/gamespot so you don't miss an episode.

Hazard Zone is Battlefield 2042’s competitive extraction style game mode and it can be very challenging. Here’s the best way to use guns, specialists, and tactics to get those data drives and get out alive.

Battlefield 2042 has three main modes: All-Out Warfare, Portal, and Hazard Zone. Hazard Zone is an extraction mode that draws influence from hero shooters, popular battle royale titles, and games like Hunt: Showdown and Escape from Tarkov. In our 12-hour review event, we spent around four hours with the mode and learned a lot. Here’s what you should know. 

In this video, we’re giving you 18 things we wish we knew before playing. These tips will help you earn more Dark Market credits, help you develop tactics, cover what kind of guns to purchase at the start of each round, help you survive the extraction process, and more. We’ll also cover how mechanics like the Call-In tablet, plus system, and some specialist abilities work in slightly different ways in this mode, as well as some tactical dos and don’ts. 

Battlefield 2042 is out now in early access with a general release on November 19. The game has cross-progression, cross-play, and cross-buy on PC, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. It's worth noting, though, that matches sport aa lower player count on last-gen consoles. Head on over to YouTube.com/GameSpot for our review-in-progress, and more gameplay, like a video of a No Specialist Mode from Portal.
