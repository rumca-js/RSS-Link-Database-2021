There's a chance that\nyou might update and find your font extra large or small. If so, you\ncan just manually add <code>xrandr --dpi 96</code> to the beginning of your\n<code>xprofile</code> to set the DPI to the typical 96 (or whatever number\nlooks best).</li>\n<li>I have no switched new installs of LARBS from using Pulseaudio to\nPipewire as an audio backend, although it will also come with\n<code>pipewire-pulse</code> to maintain compatibility with Pulseaudio programs.\nIf you would like to update the dotfiles, remember to install the\n<code>pipewire</code> and <code>pipewire-pulse</code> packages. There should be no major\ndifference in user experience, although using Pipewire will avoid\nsome silly Pulseaudio bugs.</li>\n</ol>", "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/updates/important-notes-for-larbs-users/", "date_published": "2021-11-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}]
