Starting December 1, Xbox gold members can grab The Escapists 2 and Orcs Must Die, with the latter only being available until December 15. Starting on the 16th, members can grab Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition as well as Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.\n\nLastly, in other Xbox-related news, the Series X Mini Fridge is reportedly louder than most would like. Our very own Gabe Gurwin recently set up his fridge and found that it is \u201ceasily as loud or louder than the actual Xbox Series X or PS5 when they have discs spinning.\u201d\n\nFor more information on all of our topics, please visit gamespot.com.\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro - 00:00\nHalo Infinite - 00:06\nGames With Gold - 01:30\nXbox Mini Fridge - 02:06\nOutro - 02:52", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOL7gnTn-r0", "date_published": "2021-11-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Highs And Lows Of One Year All Digital", "description": "Marching into this new generation, Kurt made a conscious choice to go all-digital with the Xbox Series S and the Playstation 5. And the result has been, well, rather unexpected.\n\nGoing all-digital can be a troubling prospect for some gamers. No selling/trading in games? No borrowing or lending them? What if your favorite series just disappears off the digital marketplace? They're all valid points. But still, Kurt Indovina marched bravely, or maybe naively, into an all-digital future with the Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5 Digital Edition.\u00a0\n\nJoin Kurt on the highs and lows of his digital future, including his unexpected appreciation for past games.\u00a0\n\nThe digital future can feel like a brittle one. Games like Jump Force will cease to exist on digital storefronts come February 2022; Metal Gear Solid 2 & 3 have pulled due to licensing issues over archival footage; and Rockstar Games delisted GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas weeks before the release of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition. On the flipside, however, there's a lot for what digital features offer, like Xbox's Quick Resume, and the digital service Game Pass.\n\n#PS5 #XBOX", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_1l_FHym7I", "date_published": "2021-11-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "5 Secrets From the Elden Ring Network Test", "description": "Like Dark Souls, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro before it, Elden Ring is filled with secrets.

Yet in 2009, Bungie delivered a more somber FPS experience with Halo 3: ODST. And, for producer Jessie Earl, Halo 3: ODST is far and away the best campaign in the entire Halo franchise.\u00a0\n\nYes, better than Halo 2, Halo Reach, or especially Halo 5: Guardians.\u00a0\n\nHalo 3 ODST is the game that should not be. Not only is ODST a complete tonal shift for the franchise, focusing on a more somber, small stakes story, it was also created out of the ashes of a completely different Halo project and made in basically a single year. This game should be a complete mess.\n\nYet, instead Bungie\u2019s Halo 3: ODST is a masterclass in tone, storytelling, and game design that resonates, even more, today than it did back when it was released. So let\u2019s break down why this underappreciated gem still holds up amidst its blockbuster siblings.\n\nAnd, if you want to see our full Halo Ranking from everyone at Gamespot, check out this video: https://youtu.be/YWTvIuHCgUE", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hw58JxXj-I", "date_published": "2021-11-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
