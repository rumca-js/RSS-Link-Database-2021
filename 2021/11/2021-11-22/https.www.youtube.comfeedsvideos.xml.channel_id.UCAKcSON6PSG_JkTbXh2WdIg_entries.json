A particularly memorable performance, however, came in April 2017, when Doughty performed a MicroShow for a gathering of listeners who entered for a chance to win a seat at the performance, recorded live in a salon at the historic James J. Hill House in St. Paul, Minnesota. Watch four performances from that MicroShow set.\n\n00:00 \"True Dreams of Wichita\"\n04:04 \"Super Bon Bon\"\n07:07 \"Light Will Keep Your Heart Beating in the Future\"\n10:15 \"Circles\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nMike Doughty \u2013 vocals and guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Luke Taylor\n\nFIND MORE:\n2005 April studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2005/04/28/mike_doughty\n2005 October studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2005/10/13/mike_doughty\n2008 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2008/02/19/mike_doughty\n2011 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/11/11/mike-doughty\n2012 Theft of the Dial:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/12/06/theft-of-the-dial-mike-doughty\n2013 interview with Mary Lucia:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/10/25/interview-mike-doughty\n2014 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/11/22/mike-doughty-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2014 Guitar Collection feature:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/12/03/the-currents-guitar-collection-mike-doughty\n2015 interview on move to Memphis:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/11/24/mike-doughty-finds-a-fresh-start-in-memphis\n2017 MicroShow at James J.
