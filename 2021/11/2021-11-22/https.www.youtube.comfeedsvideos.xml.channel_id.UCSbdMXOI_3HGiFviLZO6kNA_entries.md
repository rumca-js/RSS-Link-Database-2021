This is a video on why I recommend Quests and talk about Meta even though I disagree with some of the foundations of Meta and Facebook. This is my stance moving forward on this channel as to why I will do the things i do. This has been weighing on me heavily. I hope these words resonate well with some people. If you agree or disagree, let me know in the comments. Lets have a discussion, otherwise, lets talk about it on my Discord. 

I love VR and the Virtual Reality industry so much. I want to see it thrive and prosper in an open ecosystem with choice and fairness for everybody.
