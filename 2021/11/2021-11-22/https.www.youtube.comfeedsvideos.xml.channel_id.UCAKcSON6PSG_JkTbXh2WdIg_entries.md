Seven years ago — Nov. 22, 2014 — Mike Doughty visited The Current studio to perform a set of songs accompanied by his longtime collaborator, Andrew "Scrap" Livingston.

Doughty has enjoyed a long connection with The Current, having performed in The Current studio during the station's first year and many years since. A particularly memorable performance, however, came in April 2017, when Doughty performed a MicroShow for a gathering of listeners who entered for a chance to win a seat at the performance, recorded live in a salon at the historic James J. Hill House in St. Paul, Minnesota. Watch four performances from that MicroShow set.

00:00 "True Dreams of Wichita"
04:04 "Super Bon Bon"
07:07 "Light Will Keep Your Heart Beating in the Future"
10:15 "Circles"
