This week, Mary Lucia shares her thoughts on Peter Jackson's three-part Beatles docuseries, "Get Back," streaming now on Disney+.  

"Give it up for Peter Jackson," Mary says, "the man who sifted through I can't even imagine how many hours of film to create the documentary Get Back. It is a tremendous endeavor to take all that footage and sync up the audio with all their talking and recording. And the result is really great, offering true Beatles fans an intimate fly-on-the-wall perspective."

Watch more of what Mary Lucia has to say in the video above.
