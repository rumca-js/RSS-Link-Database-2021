UK not seeing so many hospitalisations relative to Europe despite a high number of cases.

Long term T cell immunity after antibodies wane

Looks like, AstraZeneca initially gives higher levels of T-cells

France, Germany, Spain, Belgium – restricted AZ to the under 65s

UK may have high T cells from natural infection and cross immunity from other coronavirus infections

European leaders had all these unfounded concerns about AstraZeneca and its use in older people

If you look at the data, you can see us using it early has been incredibly helpful in terms of protecting older and vulnerable people from this disease for longer

Dr Peter English

People whose immune systems have produced a strong T-cell response but a weaker antibody response might be more likely to be infected in the first place 

but more likely to be able to fight the infection, and they will be much less likely to develop severe disease

It is plausible that this generated an excellent T-cell response, which means that while people can still be infected and infectious, they are unlikely to be seriously unwell

Prof Matthew Snape, Oxford University

The best T-cell responses seem to come if you give a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by Pfizer

Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert

Third jabs may be unnecessary

Seven-day average

Cases up 18%

Hospital admissions up 6%

135 million people eligible for boosters

Heading into the winter months, when respiratory viruses are more likely to spread,
 
and with plans for increased holiday season travel and gatherings, 

boosting people’s overall protection against covid-19 disease and death was important to do now

In the fully vaccinated

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html

Infections happen in only a small proportion of people who are fully vaccinated, even with the Delta variant. 

When these infections occur among vaccinated people, they tend to be mild

If you are fully vaccinated and become infected with the Delta variant, you can spread the virus to others

Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty, in children 5 to 11 years

(12 to 15s, May 5, 2021)

the Department has determined that the benefits of this vaccine for children between 5 and 11 years of age outweigh the risks

Two-dose regimen, 10 micrograms

Three weeks apart

Immune response in children 5 to 11 years, comparable to 16 to 25

The vaccine was 90.7% effective at preventing COVID-19 in children 5 to 11 years of age

and no serious side effects were identified

Ongoing studies and real-world data

to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh any risks, as well as to detect any potential new safety signals in any age group
