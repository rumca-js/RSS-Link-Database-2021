While the technology was still developing everything had to be built from the ground up. Developers usually coded their own engine, created all the art assets and sounds \u2013 I can\u2019t find a source right now but I remember reading that the underwater explosion sound in Quake was created by wrapping a condom around a microphone and sticking it in a bath. That\u2019s a fun story. They made the explodey head effect in the movie Scanners by filling a fake head with dogfood and blasting it with a shotgun. That\u2019s a fun story, too. A lot more fun than \u201cwe downloaded it from a library\u201d or \u201cwe just used CG.\u201d\n\nJoin YouTube Memberships and support our content for Early Access to new videos, exclusive Discord perks & more for just $2 per month \u25ba\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqg5FCR7NrpvlBWMXdt-5Vg/join\n\nSubscribe to Escapist Magazine! \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/Sub2Escapist\n\nWant to see the next episode a week early?
