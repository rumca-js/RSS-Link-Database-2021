Seven for the dwarves in their halls of stone.  Today, we cover the seven dwarven rings of power, from their creation in Eregion, to falling into Sauron's hands, to ultimately being given to the dwarves.  From there, they would be at the foundation of legendary treasure hoards of the dwarves, before falling - one by one - to either dragons or Sauron himself.
