This week, Mary Lucia talks about Todd Haynes's documentary, 'The Velvet Underground,' which is streaming now on Apple TV.  

"Haynes is very much involved in music and documenting music and making interesting films," Mary says. "With the Velvet Underground, it seems like a no brainer. If you can talk to anybody who is still alive, it's like you got a great film. And that is the case with this.

"Todd Haynes obviously doesn't want to capture like a definitive version of VU, which maybe there isn't one," Mary continues. "But there's a lot of footage that I'd never seen before that still exists that clearly he got his hands on, which is great. And then the interviews with everyone are truly amazing."

Watch more of what Mary Lucia has to say in the video above.
