In today's GameSpot News, Persia talks about the new Among Us update, a new weapon coming to Fortnite, and more. 

Among Us has released a new update called the Cosmicube Update that introduces a store, new cosmetic items, achievements, an XP system, and four new roles that players can choose. Each roles offers unique abilities such as the Scientist who can look at vitals at any time as well as the engineer who can also freely take vents. 

Fornite has also released its November 9 patch that will replace the Standard Pistol with the beefier Combat Pistol and also give a nice buff to the Sideways Rifle. Expect things to pick up quickly in the days ahead, as we continue to build toward some sort of showdown with the Cube Queen.

## Elden Ring Hands On Preview

We got hands-on with the Elden Ring closed network test, and it felt both familiar and different in an exciting way.

Of all the things I expected from Elden Ring, a sense of serenity wasn't one of them. Whether you've played From Software's games or are simply aware of them, you likely have an idea of what they offer: doomed kingdoms, tragic characters, a pervasive sense of melancholy, and gameplay that will challenge both your skill and your resolve. And yet, what defined my seven hours of hands-on time with the Elden Ring closed network test was what many would consider uncharacteristic of a Soulsborne game: tranquility.

As much of a surprise as that was, it's not something that's completely uncommon in these games. Whether it's the Nexus, Firelink Shrine, Hunter's Dream, or the Dilapidated Temple, each FromSoft title has a place where adventurers can find respite from the cruelty of the world beyond. These places have a sympathetic quality to them, somehow being able to acknowledge the harshness of the world, lament that its fate has been put upon your shoulders, and comfort you when you're at your lowest, giving you the space to put yourself together before you pick yourself up and venture out once more.

Walking around the Lands Between, specifically a small section of an area called Lingrave, I felt that same intent, but laid out over a vast open world. The gentle, understated music that played as I wandered around aimlessly, or marveled at the beautiful golden Erdtree towering above, invited me to let my guard down and take in the world around me without the fear that a blade would suddenly be plunged into me. And when I did, I found the world to be both familiar and unlike anything in From Software's previous games.

Let’s get you caught up on Battlefield 2042 ahead of release. We’re here with a full overview of features like All-Out Warfare, Portal Mode, Hazard Zone, Specialists, when to play early, post-launch seasons, and more. 

Battlefield 2042 goes into early access on November 12 and fully releases on November 19. There is a massive amount of information to catch you up on. Even with a couple of preview events and an open beta, it’s hard for players to gauge exactly what the game will be like at launch. 

In this video, we’re catching you up on everything. We have a full breakdown of the 10 Specialist characters available at launch, what classes they fit into, and what their Specialties and Traits are. Then we’ll go over what we know about the maps and how they are different or similar to past games in the franchise. Even though there isn’t a campaign, we’ll tell you the basics of the story, which involves a looming war between the United States and Russia and the "No-Pat "characters caught in the middle including Irish and Oz. After that, you’ll get a full breakdown of modes, including All-Out Warfare, Portal, and Hazard Zone. The latter, Hazard Zone, is probably the biggest departure from previous Battlefield games of the past--it's a squad-based competitive match consisting of phases, a battle-royale-inspired one-life system, and its own currency called Dark Market Credits. Finally, we’ll cover new gameplay mechanics like the Plus System and what we know about post-launch seasons, including their battle pass system. 

We’re putting out tons of videos about Battlefield 2042, so while you’re waiting for a review, head on over to YouTube.com/Gamespot and watch our 21 Things Every Battlefield Player Should Know.
