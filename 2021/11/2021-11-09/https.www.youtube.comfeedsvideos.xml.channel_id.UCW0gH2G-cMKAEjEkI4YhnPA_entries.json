Today, we cover the seven dwarven rings of power, from their creation in Eregion, to falling into Sauron's hands, to ultimately being given to the dwarves.  From there, they would be at the foundation of legendary treasure hoards of the dwarves, before falling - one by one - to either dragons or Sauron himself.\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
