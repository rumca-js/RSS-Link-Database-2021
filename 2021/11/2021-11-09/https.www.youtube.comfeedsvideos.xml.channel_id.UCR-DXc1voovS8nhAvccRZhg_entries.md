The CutiePi is the first Raspberry Pi-based tablet I've used that I'd actually consider a 'tablet'. It's no iPad, but it is a fun and durable tablet with a little bit of fun in the form of a handle that doubles as a stand.

Is it a tablet for everyone? No. But it does have its uses, and it gives you a full open source hardware Linux tablet that can run a variety of systems, including CutiePi's own Shell UI.
