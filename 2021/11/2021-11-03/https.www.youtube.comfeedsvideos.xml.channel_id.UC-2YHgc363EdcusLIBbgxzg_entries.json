In the full interview we go way deep into the science of his book Project Hail Mary (MAJOR spoiler warning), but in this clip, he shares how random chance caused technology to evolve in vastly different directions in human history - and it all has to do with wine.\n\nCheck out the full interview here!\nhttps://answerswithjoe.com/conversations-andy-weir/\n\nWant to support the channel?
