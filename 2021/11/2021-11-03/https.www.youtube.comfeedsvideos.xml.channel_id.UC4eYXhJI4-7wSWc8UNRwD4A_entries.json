Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | November 4, 2021\nFrom an elegant performance space in Lagos, Nigeria, Temilade Openiyi, aka Tems, adorns hues that recall the title of her latest EP, If Orange Was a Place. As she slips into performance mode, emoting with her eyelids drooped slightly, she begins \"Found\" in her upper register before switching to that unmistakably rich alto range. That's when the magic starts.\n\nHer music aligns perfectly with the Tiny Desk aesthetic: Everything is stripped away to reveal the feels. Over the past couple of years, the Nigerian singer's star has been on a steady ascent, beginning with the release of her first couple of singles, \"Try Me\" and \"Mr. Rebel.\" \"Damages\" (performed here) was huge in Nigeria and helped put her name on the U.S. map. That slow and steady approach led to features on two huge international hits: Drake's \"Fountains,\" one of the standouts on Certified Lover Boy, and \"Essence\" by Wizkid featuring ahem ... starring Tems. Originally released last year, the latter was arguably the song of this summer (ask anyone who braved the nightclubs in 2021). Those two jams served as a gateway to what's becoming a substantial discography, and her Tiny Desk setlist tacitly implies, \"I know you love those songs and you'll love these, too.\" She's right.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Found\"\n\"Free Mind\"\n\"Looku Looku\"\n\"Replay\"\n\"Damages\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTems: vocals\nNsikak David: guitar\nAfolabi Adekomaiya: drums\nObinna Enwere: keys\nAyo Dele Owa: bass\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: ua.x\nProducer: Ebuka Nwobu.\nProduction Manager: Chisom Nwobu\nDOP: FEDWORKS\nArt Director: Desola Falomo\nAssociate Producers: Kenechukwu Nwobu, Adedamola Adetunji\nGaffer: Ekene Ucheonwu\nCamera Operators: Gbolahan Inaolaji Quam, Folarin Oludare\nLocation Manager: Debo Johnson\nCamera Assistants: Tobi Oloko\nEditor: uaxstudio\nColorist: Eduvie 'Stedi' Emojevwe\nProduction Company: uaxstudio + Ladder, Lex & Booker\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #tems", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXI7NP7TDCw", "date_published": "2021-11-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Joss Favela: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAnamaria Sayre | November 3, 2021\nEvery inch of Joss Favela\u2019s Sinaloa-based, sombrero-shrouded \u201cEl Tiny\u201d concert invokes the musical lineage of Mexican Regional music. Mixing soulful vocals with twangy guitars and a classic accordion, he opens with a sweet rendition of a genre staple, love ballad \u201cPienso en T\u00ed.\u201d Next, he dips into a heartfelt, piano-driven version of a song he wrote for his sister \u201cLa Mejor Versi\u00f3n de Mi.\u201d Taking a beat between the tracks, he invites us to partake in the legacy of generations of caballeros that preceded him. \u201cYo soy de un rancho que se llama Caitime, Sinaloa, Mexico y con esta m\u00fasica crecimos,\u201d he says, \u201cesta m\u00fasica vivimos, y nos gusta porque son nuestras ra\u00edces, nuestra cultura, nuestra gente. (I\u2019m from a ranch town called Caitime, Sinaloa, Mexico and we grew up with this music, we live this music and we like it because it\u2019s our roots, our culture, our people.)\u201d\n\nAfter moving through an upbeat performance of \u201cEl Alumno,\u201d Kinky bassist Cesar Pliego Villarreal joins the ranchero ensemble. The Monterrey native uses his bass to infuse a different Mexican tradition on three more classic Regional tracks: \u201cMe Vas a Extranar,\u201d \u201cBonita\u201d and \u201cCuando Fuimos Nada.\u201d\n\nAs torch-bearers of a complex and beloved sonic tradition, one can imagine there are moments for Mexican Regional stars where preservation precedes performance. At the end of his Tiny Desk, the caballero pauses and allows sweet accordion sounds carrying souls of the past to fill the space.\n\n\u201cMuchas gracias Tiny Desk,\u201d Favela says, \u201cpor llevar nuestra m\u00fasica regional a tantos lugares,\ny tantos corazones. (Thank you very much Tiny Desk for taking our regional music to so many places, and so many hearts.)\u201d\n\nSET LIST\n* \"Pienso en Ti\"\n* \"La Mejor Versi\u00f3n de M\u00ed\"\n* \"El Alumno\"\n* \"Me Vas a Extra\u00f1ar\"\n* \"Bonita\"\n* \"Cuando Fuimos Nada\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n* Joss Favela: vocals, guitar\n* Cesar Pliego Villarreal: bajo quinto\n* Daniel Valenzuela Le\u00f3n: accordion, bass\n* Gustavo A.
