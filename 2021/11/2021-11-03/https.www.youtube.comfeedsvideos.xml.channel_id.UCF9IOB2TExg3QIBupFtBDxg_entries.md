Booster doses probably needed by most people, unfortunately.

US, 20.6 million so far

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html

Six months after 2nd shot

65 years and older

50–64 years with underlying medical conditions

18 – 64 years, working / living in high-risk settings

18 years and older, 2 months Johnson & Johnson/Janssen

Protection of BNT162b2 Vaccine Booster against Covid-19 in Israel (NEJM, October 2021)

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114255?

July 30, 2021, over 602

Third (booster) dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine was approved

60 years or older who had been fully vaccinated

August 29th, anyone over 12

At least five months previously

N = 1,144,690

2 dynamic cohorts

2 vaccines only

N = 5.2 million person days

4,439 confirmed infections

294 cases of severe covid
(based on 4.6 million person days)

2 vaccines + booster

N = 10.6 million person days

934 confirmed infections

29 cases of severe COVID-19
(based on 6.3 million person days)

(despite older demographic)

Twelve days or more after the booster dose

Increases antibody neutralization levels ~10-fold compared to after 2nd dose

11.3 fold decrease in the relative risk of confirmed infection

Efficacy among booster recipients to approximately 95%

(May have waned to 50% with time and delta variant)

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262423v1

19.5 fold decrease in the relative risk of severe illness

Factor reduction in reduced rate of confirmed infection in boosted versus none-boosted

In conjunction with safety reports

this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a third vaccine dose,

in both reducing transmission and severe disease,

indicates the great potential of curtailing the Delta variant resurgence by administering booster shots

Decline in immunity, UK data

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/over-eight-million-people-in-the-uk-receive-covid-19-booster-jabs

Protection against symptomatic disease, Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine  

65%, up to 3 months after the second dose

45% 6 months after the second dose

Protection against symptomatic disease, Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine

90% up to 3 months after 2nd dose

65% 6 months after the second dose

Protection against hospitalisation, Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine 

95% at 3 months

75% at 6 months 

Protection against hospitalisation, Pfizer/BioNTech

99% at 3 months

90% at 6 months

Why this is important

A small change can generate a major shift in hospital admissions

A change from 95% to 90% against hospitalisation would lead to doubling of admissions in those vaccinated

Early UK booster results from Pfizer

Booster restores protection back up to 

95.6% against symptomatic infection

Booster doses, Situation in UK

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/over-eight-million-people-in-the-uk-receive-covid-19-booster-jabs

8,115,229 boosted so far

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-booster-vaccine/

Booster vaccine doses, available on the NHS

People most at risk from COVID-19,

who have had a 2nd dose of a vaccine at least 6 months ago

(after 5 months for high risk groups)

This includes:

Aged 50 and over

Frontline health / care workers

16 and over with a health condition

16 and over, carers or live with venerable people

Pregnant women in eligible groups

COVID-19 booster vaccine and flu vaccine

If you are offered both vaccines, it's safe to have them at the same time.

Under reporting of deaths, 19 months into the pandemic

https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html

Total deaths, 5,018,949

Total cases, 247,883,004

Total vaccine doses, 7,129,732,439

World Health Organization

https://www.who.int/data/stories/the-true-death-toll-of-covid-19-estimating-global-excess-mortality

Based on the excess mortality estimates produced for 2020

we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19

Many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems

Percentage of registered deaths

https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/score/dashboard#/

98% in the European

10% in the African region

Comparisons difficult

Excess mortality

The difference in the total number of deaths in a crisis,

compared to those expected under normal conditions

Therefore, includes direct and indirect impact

WHO, 2020 data

Official, 1,813,100

Lower bound, 3 million

Region of the Americas in 2020

Excess mortality estimates range from 1.34 to 1.46 million

60% more than reported

European Region in 2020

Excess mortality estimates range from 

1.11 to 1.21 million

50% more than reported

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates

Excess death calculations

Actual worldwide toll, 16.8 million excess deaths

95% probability, 10.3 million to 19.5 million

Official versus actual deaths (Economist)

US, deaths = 745,274
US, deaths = 860,000 to 1 million

China, deaths = 4,600
China, deaths = 150,000 to 1,700,000

India, deaths = 458,000
India, deaths = 1.2 million to 7.2 million

Russia, deaths = 236,462
Russia, deaths = 870,000 to 910,000

Indonesia, deaths = 143,457
Indonesia, deaths = 300,000 to 1.2 million

Pakistan, deaths = 28,477
Pakistan, deaths = 300,000 to 910,000

Bangladesh, deaths = 27,873
Bangladesh, deaths = 200,000 to 720,000

Turkey, deaths = 71,052
Turkey, deaths = 130,000 to 420,000

Mexico, deaths = 288,464
Mexico, deaths = 560,000 to 600,000

Brazil, deaths = 608,071
Brazil, deaths = 660,000 to 740,000

Factors

Death tolls are heavily influenced by the age structure of a country’s population

Rely on the assumption that officially published excess-mortality numbers are accurate

Covid-19 disruption, some governments may have changed how they compile data

Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington

https://covid19.healthdata.org/global?view=cumulative-deaths&tab=trend

Total deaths are the estimated number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, including unreported deaths.

Reported and unreported deaths, 11.9 million
