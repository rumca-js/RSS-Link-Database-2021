The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | November 4, 2021
From an elegant performance space in Lagos, Nigeria, Temilade Openiyi, aka Tems, adorns hues that recall the title of her latest EP, If Orange Was a Place. As she slips into performance mode, emoting with her eyelids drooped slightly, she begins "Found" in her upper register before switching to that unmistakably rich alto range. That's when the magic starts.

Her music aligns perfectly with the Tiny Desk aesthetic: Everything is stripped away to reveal the feels. Over the past couple of years, the Nigerian singer's star has been on a steady ascent, beginning with the release of her first couple of singles, "Try Me" and "Mr. Rebel." "Damages" (performed here) was huge in Nigeria and helped put her name on the U.S. map. That slow and steady approach led to features on two huge international hits: Drake's "Fountains," one of the standouts on Certified Lover Boy, and "Essence" by Wizkid featuring ahem ... starring Tems. Originally released last year, the latter was arguably the song of this summer (ask anyone who braved the nightclubs in 2021). Those two jams served as a gateway to what's becoming a substantial discography, and her Tiny Desk setlist tacitly implies, "I know you love those songs and you'll love these, too." She's right.

Anamaria Sayre | November 3, 2021
Every inch of Joss Favela’s Sinaloa-based, sombrero-shrouded “El Tiny” concert invokes the musical lineage of Mexican Regional music. Mixing soulful vocals with twangy guitars and a classic accordion, he opens with a sweet rendition of a genre staple, love ballad “Pienso en Tí.” Next, he dips into a heartfelt, piano-driven version of a song he wrote for his sister “La Mejor Versión de Mi.” Taking a beat between the tracks, he invites us to partake in the legacy of generations of caballeros that preceded him. “Yo soy de un rancho que se llama Caitime, Sinaloa, Mexico y con esta música crecimos,” he says, “esta música vivimos, y nos gusta porque son nuestras raíces, nuestra cultura, nuestra gente. (I’m from a ranch town called Caitime, Sinaloa, Mexico and we grew up with this music, we live this music and we like it because it’s our roots, our culture, our people.)”

After moving through an upbeat performance of “El Alumno,” Kinky bassist Cesar Pliego Villarreal joins the ranchero ensemble. The Monterrey native uses his bass to infuse a different Mexican tradition on three more classic Regional tracks: “Me Vas a Extranar,” “Bonita” and “Cuando Fuimos Nada.”

As torch-bearers of a complex and beloved sonic tradition, one can imagine there are moments for Mexican Regional stars where preservation precedes performance. At the end of his Tiny Desk, the caballero pauses and allows sweet accordion sounds carrying souls of the past to fill the space.

“Muchas gracias Tiny Desk,” Favela says, “por llevar nuestra música regional a tantos lugares,
y tantos corazones. (Thank you very much Tiny Desk for taking our regional music to so many places, and so many hearts.)”
