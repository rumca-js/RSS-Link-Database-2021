Happy birthday to Courtney Barnett! November 3 is the birthday of the prolific, Melbourne-based singer-songwriter. Despite the distance to Australia, Barnett is a longtime friend of The Current, having performed in our studio many times, and she has played at Rock the Garden twice — one of only two artists to do so (the other being Bon Iver).

In 2016, Barnett visited our studio to perform a solo acoustic set. Watch two songs from that 2016 session at The Current. (Video in black and white at artist's request.)

0:00 "Depreston"
