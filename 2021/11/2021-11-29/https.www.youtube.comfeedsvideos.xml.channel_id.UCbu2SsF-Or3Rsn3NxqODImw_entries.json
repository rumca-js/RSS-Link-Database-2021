This problem seems to be more widespread on PC, and as a result, players are asking 343 to introduce a cross-play toggle so console players can more easily avoid cheaters.\n\nDeVante also talks about 343\u2019s Jerry Hook revealing more \u201crobust\" updates are coming to Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer progression system. This system was criticized almost immediately after the game's multiplayer launched on November 15 for being slow and too challenge based.\u00a0\n\nLater in the video, 343\u2019s community manager reacts to Halo Pro LxthuL\u2019s complaints about ranked matchmaking and promises to share more detailed updates on a solution.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ1bh1R-QjI", "date_published": "2021-11-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Halo Infinite | Campaign Launch Trailer", "description": "Check out the Halo Infinite campaign launch trailer!
