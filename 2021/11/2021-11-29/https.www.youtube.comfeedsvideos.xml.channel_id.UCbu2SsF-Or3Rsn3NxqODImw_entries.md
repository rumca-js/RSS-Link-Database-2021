In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Halo Infinite suffering from cheaters and hackers, progression backlash, ranked balancing issues and campaign leaks due to physical copies releasing early. 

In this video, DeVante talks about Halo Infinite players taking to social media to report instances of cheating and hacking in the game. This problem seems to be more widespread on PC, and as a result, players are asking 343 to introduce a cross-play toggle so console players can more easily avoid cheaters.

DeVante also talks about 343’s Jerry Hook revealing more “robust" updates are coming to Halo Infinite’s multiplayer progression system. This system was criticized almost immediately after the game's multiplayer launched on November 15 for being slow and too challenge based. 

Later in the video, 343’s community manager reacts to Halo Pro LxthuL’s complaints about ranked matchmaking and promises to share more detailed updates on a solution.

The Halo Universe has one of the richest and densest mythos in all of gaming, and with Halo Infinite promising to build on all this lore, it can easily feel overwhelming to newcomers. Don’t worry, we’ve got you like the Master Chief has Cortana, because we’re going to take you on the Great Journey through The Complete Timeline of the Halo Franchise.

Despite the seemingly straightforward story stretching from Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo 5: Guardians, the story of Master Chief stretches back well before humanity discovered their first Halo ring or began fighting the Flood. So in case you need a refresher on everything from the Forerunners to Halo Wars to who the big bad villain Atriox is for Halo Infinite, look no further.
