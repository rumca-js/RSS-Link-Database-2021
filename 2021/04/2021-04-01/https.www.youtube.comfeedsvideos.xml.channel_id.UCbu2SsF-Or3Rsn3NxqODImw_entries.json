Is gaming finally feeling the full knock-on effect of 2020? Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor discuss.\n\nYou've probably felt it: things are a bit out of whack in the video game industry. The past year has been difficult for a variety of reasons and it seems like the knock-on effects of working from home, as well as the challenges that presents to game development and hosting traditional events, is becoming more and more apparent.\n\nWhat's most evident is that the traditional release cycle, in terms of the rhythm of new games being launched, is off. At the same time, events that had been permanently marked on our calendars for years now are either being penciled in or rubbed out entirely. 2021 feels like it's becoming a weird year for video games and those of us that enjoy them.\u00a0\n\nThat is the subject of discussion this week's episode of Console Crew, in which Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor look at how the industry has changed, what the future holds, and also what we can look forward to for the rest of the year. Naturally, there's a discussion about games that have been delayed as a result of recent challenges, and the same goes for events like E3.\u00a0\n\nThere's also a discussion about the opportunities that this strange new cadence of releases provides us. As noted in the episode, indie games are more abundant and more interesting than ever, and with fewer major blockbusters from mega-publishers eating up the oxygen in the discussion of games, there's more opportunity for them to shine.\n\nConsole Crew is your weekly Friday roundup of the biggest news from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, hosted by Lucy James, Tamoor Hussain, and Jordan Ram\u00e9e.

It\u2019s time to look at what Call Of Duty players don\u2019t understand about each other and if Activision can ever break from the yearly cycle.\u00a0\n\nCall Of Duty continues its yearly cycle, and the changes that cycle institutes to Warzone have left the Modern Warfare and Cold War audiences in different worlds. Ever since Cold War took over the Season Pass, store, and events in Warzone, Modern Warfare players have felt left behind. Meanwhile, Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has gathered a classic Call Of Duty fan base looking for an entirely different arcade experience. In this video, we are going to look at the Modern Warfare versus Cold War players, how they are feeling about the state of Call Of Duty, and what each audience is looking for. Important topics we\u2019re going to cover are why Modern Warfare fans feel robbed of Season 7 and missing weapons, what Cold War fans know about Call Of Duty that many new players don\u2019t, and if Modern Warfare is a true Call Of Duty game.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ll also explore how the conflict between Call Of Duty audiences largely comes down to Activision\u2019s yearly release cycle and how that might no longer make sense with titles from Treyarch, Infinity Ward, Raven Software, and Sledgehammer Games being so different, yet all having to tie into Warzone. Finally, we\u2019re going to go back to your response to the rumor that the next Call Of Duty game might go back to World War II.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re expecting more Call Of Duty announcements this spring, including what the rumored WW2 Vanguard game might be. Call Of Duty: Warzone is building up to Season 3, invading the map with zombies, and possibly building up to a nuke event.
