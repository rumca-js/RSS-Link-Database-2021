Today, we aim to discover the true identity of The Lake-town Spy who sometimes travels under the alias "Darrylgorn".  Is he truly Aragorn's twin brother? Or is it merely a ruse to hide his true identity? Join us as we seek to discover - who is the Lake-town Spy?!

I hope you all have a fun-filled April Fools' Day and be sure to hit "subscribe" and the bell so you don't miss Saturday's video - where we get back to our normal lore, travels, and theories!
