No, I don't think so\n\nImpossible to prevent variants from coming into the UK\n\nWe have to accept the idea that stopping variants coming to the UK is not a realistic starting point,\n\nbut you can

accidental leak\n\nAnd it's outrageous that they would insert that it's highly unlikely when they didn't even bother to look into it\n\nWhat they said is that they were given the task of examining the zoonotic origin of the pandemic\n\nSo in the framing of the task, a conclusion was already implicit\n\nmost likely that Covid-19 accidentally leaked from a lab\n\nRobert Redfield, doctor, virologist, former CDC director\n\nI am of the point of view that I still think the most likely etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was from a laboratory, you know, escaped\n\nNow, other people don't believe that, that's fine.\n\nScience will eventually figure it out. \n\nIt's not unusual for respiratory pathogens that are being worked on in the laboratory to infect the laboratory worker\n\nI do not believe this somehow came from a bat to a human. \n\nAnd at that moment in time, the virus came to the human, became one of the most infectious viruses that we know in humanity for human to human transmission. \n\nNormally, when a pathogen goes from a zoonotic to human, it takes a while for it to figure out how to become more and more efficient\n\nNot a proven fact, I'm allowed to have
