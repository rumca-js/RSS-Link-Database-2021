Britain learns to treat coronavirus like flu

Prof Chris Whitty

Up to 25,000 people die in a bad flu year without anyone noticing, 2017 -2018

Every year, somewhere between 7,000 and 9,000 citizens die of flu

most of them very elderly

Accepting some Covid deaths, the price of a whole life

Royal School of Medicine webinar

Government, pull the alarm cord because of dangerous now VOC

Covid is not going to go away

You've got to work out what's a rational policy to this and here I would differentiate quite a lot between a 
pandemic environment and what you get with seasonal flu

So it is clear we are going to have to manage it, at some point, rather like we manage the flu. 

Here is a seasonal, very dangerous disease that kills thousands of people and society has chosen a particular way round it.

Society would not tolerate lock down to prevent flu type numbers

We want to get as close as we can [to zero] but the question is how do you balance that against other priorities?

What are people prepared to put up with

Flu appears to be optional

We need to work out some balance which actually keeps it at a low level, 

minimises deaths as best we can, but in a way that the population tolerates, 

through medical countermeasures like vaccines 

and in due course drugs, 

which mean you can minimise mortality while not maximising the economic and social impacts on our fellow citizens

Lockdowns would be reimposed if cases rose? No, I don't think so

Impossible to prevent variants from coming into the UK

We have to accept the idea that stopping variants coming to the UK is not a realistic starting point,

but you can slow it down

The main thing we're concerned about is the risk of importing into the UK variants which could have a reduced effectiveness of the vaccines we're currently using

They did absolutely nothing to even consider the possibility of an accidental leak

And it's outrageous that they would insert that it's highly unlikely when they didn't even bother to look into it

What they said is that they were given the task of examining the zoonotic origin of the pandemic

So in the framing of the task, a conclusion was already implicit

most likely that Covid-19 accidentally leaked from a lab

Robert Redfield, doctor, virologist, former CDC director

I am of the point of view that I still think the most likely etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was from a laboratory, you know, escaped

Now, other people don't believe that, that's fine.

Science will eventually figure it out. 

It's not unusual for respiratory pathogens that are being worked on in the laboratory to infect the laboratory worker

I do not believe this somehow came from a bat to a human. 

And at that moment in time, the virus came to the human, became one of the most infectious viruses that we know in humanity for human to human transmission. 

Normally, when a pathogen goes from a zoonotic to human, it takes a while for it to figure out how to become more and more efficient

Not a proven fact, I'm allowed to have opinions now

Believes the virus began spreading, perhaps since September or October

Global settlement for next pandemic 

World War Two style deal

Build cross-border cooperation

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

At that time, following the devastation of two world wars, political leaders came together to forge the multilateral system

The aims were clear: To bring countries together, to dispel the temptations of isolationism and nationalism, and to address the challenges that could only be achieved together in the spirit of solidarity and co-operation - namely peace, prosperity, health and security

Leaders

Countries be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly co-ordinated fashion

Systems for alerting people about potential pandemics

Improving the sharing of data

Dr David Nabarro

Without some kind of special action, the world as a whole will not be vaccinated until well into 2022

During that time all sorts of problems with variants will emerge
