How does my 2.5 Gbps Raspberry Pi NAS compare to a dual 2.5 Gbps ASUSTOR Lockerstor 4? Find out in this video, the second part of a two-part series.

I will explore the software on both NASes—ADM on the Lockerstor and OMV on the Raspberry Pi—and run some performance benchmarks. I'll also tell about a few surprising discoveries I made along the way!
