Just to be a female bass player in the man's world of jazz is to be a unicorn, that most mythical creature. To have, on top of that, a voice that spins gold and casts spells \u2014 to win a Grammy for an album literally called 12 Little Spells. The possibilities for myth, magic and fairytale are endless. \n\nBut Esperanza Spalding is very real. She's grounded in the pursuit of truth before fantasy, determined to sing songs that avoid the same old stories, to create work that defies convenient endings. \n\nAt the moment, she's busy deconstructing an actual Greek myth while taking on the fabulous beast that is opera. Her self-produced and crowd-funded project Iphigenia is a collaboration with mentor/creative partner Wayne Shorter. His groundbreaking improvisation \u2013 and legendary quartet of musicians at the center \u2013 mixes classical and jazz forms in a score set to Esperanza's poetic and subversively radical libretto. Together, the music and text reveal a new perspective into this ancient story that would have us believe that Iphigenia was born to be sacrificed. But what if we let her tell her own story and make her own ending?\n\nIn this conversation, we talk about our power to liberate the victims of historical sacrifice \u2014 in myth, in opera, in the day-to-day experience of being human. \n\nTo deconstruct also means to rebuild, and Esperanza is applying her \"athletic creativity\" to the construction of work intended to give shelter and safe haven from the dangers of our time. Her Songwrights Apothecary Lab, developed during this pandemic year, is a hybrid of songwriting workshop and guided research practice. She brings together musicians and practitioners of various disciplines \u2014 music therapy, neuroscience, Black American music, Sufism and South Indian Carnatic music \u2014  in the spirit of radical healing. It's a bold vision of what music can do, of what artists can do. And what can happen when we tell our own stories.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lq4Vw1T1Jk", "date_published": "2021-04-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK", "description": "LaTesha Harris | April 23, 2021\nTiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK is the electrifying kick-off to AFROPUNK's \"Black Spring\" festival. The virtual celebration, hosted by Jorge \"Gitoo\" Wright, features performances from ChocQuibTown, Calma Carmona, Luedji Luna and Nenny. AFROPUNK, born out of a 2003 short film by the same name, is an international movement and music festival centered on Black exploration and rebellion. Starting as a way to create space for the unacknowledged presence and influence of Black culture in a predominantly white punk scene, AFROPUNK has since evolved into a distinct, multi-genre experience.\n\n\"Black Spring\" was created to spotlight outstanding talent in Afro-Latine and Afro-Caribbean music across the globe. The Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK program aims for the same. The showcase's four artists have come to the Tiny Desk to honor their homes and celebrate the art their heritage has inspired. Learn more about them below.\n\nChocQuibTown\n\"\u00a1T\u00fa sabes!\" Carlos \"Tostao\" Valencia exclaims after Colombian hip-hop trio ChocQuibTown performs its first song, the energetic \"Somos Pac\u00edfico.\" \"ChocQuibTown, straight from Colombia, from the Pacific coast,\" he says. \"We call it Africa inside Colombia, we got the flavor, we got the flow.\" ChocQuibTown \u2014 named after the coastal area the trio hails from \u2014 is a family affair comprised of siblings Miguel \"Slow\" Martinez and Gloria \"Goyo\" Martinez, the latter of which is married to Valencia. In 2000, the trio formed to promote their neglected corner of Colombia's culture; today, ChocoQuibTown's music blends the traditionality of Afro-Latin jazz with the modernity of hip-hop to create a singular, yet versatile sound.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Somos Pac\u00edfico\"\n\"De Donde Vengo Yo\"\n\"Pa Olvidarte\"\n\"Qu\u00e9 L\u00e1stima\"\n\"Lo Que Quieras T\u00fa\"\n\"Cuando Te Veo\"\n\nNENNY\nWith warm maroon box braids nearly sweeping the floor and glitter adorning her eyes, NENNY's presence demands full attention before she even opens her mouth. Dressed in a flowy, all-white outfit accented with a pastel checker pattern and surrounded by a matching four-piece band, the 18-year-old Portuguese singer-songwriter and rapper appears otherworldly, almost heavenly, as she harmonizes with her backing electric guitar and jumps across the room, dancing with her entire body. NENNY first appeared on heads' radar in 2019 with her single \"Sushi.\" She's continued to impress with several more singles and the release of her debut project, 2020's Aura.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"B\u00fassola\"\n\"Wave\"\n\"Tequila\"\n\nLuedji Luna\n\"I feel that we are living in a crazy moment in a crazy time and music has been a safe place for me \u2014 the only safe place for me,\" Luedji Luna says in a low, alluring voice as she explains the purpose of her latest album, Bom Mesmo \u00c9 Estar Debaixo D'\u00c1gua. The album, much like the Brazillian singer-songwriters's Tiny Desk performance, is a respite from these times. Elements of jazz and blues are infused with African rhythms as Luna uses music to express her ongoing struggles for autonomy as a Black woman. She performs from her coastal hometown of Bahia in the city of Salvador, Brazil, where African culture flows in abundance. Luna is a powerhouse, entrancing and elegant, soulful and spiritual, as she uses her platform to discuss individual and systemic forms of anti-Blackness.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\u201cLen\u00e7ois\u201d\n\u201cErro\u201d\n\u201cChoror\u00f4\"\n\nCalma Carmona\nFrom her hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Calma Carmona delivers a bewitching Tiny Desk performance. Her voice rarely rises above a whisper as she sings over impassioned Afrobeats during her three-song set \u2014 but when it does, it's a gritty, intimidating growl. Carmona got her start in 2013 when the Latin soul singer-songwriter released her first EP and opened for Beyonc\u00e9's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in Puerto Rico.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"When I Was Your Girl\"\n\"Ella Se Mueve\"\n\"Vibra\"\n\nTiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK\n\nExecutive Producer: Cyrus Dennis:\nExecutive Producer: Allen Lamb\nExecutive Producer: Anthony Maddox: \nExecutive Producer: Tina Farris\nExecutive Producer: Dominic \"Suede\" Pearson\nTalent Producer: Warren Bokwe: \nTalent Coordinator: Saira Anderson\nProduction Coordinator: Venessa Gonzalez\nCreative Director: Sango Amoda\nHost: Jorge \"GITOO\" Wright: \nEditor: Brian Anderson: \nWriter: Jordana Jason \nAssociate Producer: Mokotsi Rokundo \nSPECIAL THANKS TO\nPop & Pour - Washington Heights New York\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n\nProducer: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj9nUXIPPYM", "date_published": "2021-04-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
