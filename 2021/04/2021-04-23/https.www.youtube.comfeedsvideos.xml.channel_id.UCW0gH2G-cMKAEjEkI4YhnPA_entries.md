Today we cover the origins of Sauron, including his time as the maia Mairon, coming to serve Morgoth, and fighting for the Dark Lord during the Wars of Beleriand.  We cover his life and travels throughout the First Age as he serves Melkor, seizes control of Tol Sirion, creates the werewolves, and his legendary fight with Huan the Hound of Valinor!  Enjoy today's video as we explain Sauron's story during The Silmarillion.
