The game stars Takayuki Yagami, a former lawyer turned private detective who\u2019s hunting down the mystery of multiple Yakuza members getting their eyes gouged out. Judgment is a spin-off of the Yakuza games and has similar beat-em-up combat. But this game also includes detective sequences where you comb through an area to find details that might help your case.\u00a0\n\nIn this side-by-side video, we've put the original PS4 version (running on PS4 Pro) against the new PS5 version and we show off load times, cutscenes, combat, detective work, tailing people, and a chase sequence. The original PS4 version only ran at 30 frames per second and the new PS5 version goes up to 60 frames per second so you\u2019ll definitely notice one is smoother than the other.\n\nJudgment is now available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Stadia with refined visuals and running at 60fps. RGG Studio, the creators of Yakuza and Judgment, are also teasing a Judgment related announcement on May 7 at 7am PT.

Nier Replicant ver. 1.22, out now for PS4, Xbox One, and PC isn't quite a remake and not quite a remaster, but rather something in between--and it's an astonishing improvement over the original version.\u00a0This comparison encompasses the PS3 version of the original Nier and the PS4 version of Nier Replicant.\n\nThis upgraded version of Nier Replicant uses a brand-new combat system that plays closer to Nier: Automata with features like new combo mechanics, a revamped magic system, lock-on enemy targeting, smoother player movement, higher resolution, better textures and assets, and a much smoother frame rate. And as you see in this comparison, it stars \"brother Nier\" instead of \"father Nier.\"\n\nIn the video above, you'll see a fight against a floating dictionary in Emil's mansion to obtain some vital information. This should help you get a taste of how these two versions differ. You'll notice that the cutscenes have been recreated one-to-one and preserve the strong overall narrative Nier was always known for, but they look much better with the visual enhancements. If you listen close enough, you may also catch that the voiceovers have been re-recorded by the original cast to give a modern edge to what were already stellar performances.\n\nNier Replicant is out now, and if you're thinking about jumping into this tragic and emotional action-RPG, be sure to check out our full Nier Replicant review and prepare to cry.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSla4s7D_KY", "date_published": "2021-04-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
