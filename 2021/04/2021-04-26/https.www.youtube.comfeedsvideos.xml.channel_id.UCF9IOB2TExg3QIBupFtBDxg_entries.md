J&J/Janssen Update

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/JJUpdate.html

CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend use

Reports suggest an increased risk of a rare adverse event called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)

Nearly all reports, adult women younger than 50 years old

Potential benefits outweigh known and potential risks

Women younger than 50 years old should be aware

there are other COVID-19 vaccine options available

For three weeks after receiving the vaccine

lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets

Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision

Shortness of breath

Chest pain

Leg swelling

Persistent abdominal pain

Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the injection site

Channel 12 reported Friday

More than 5 million people vaccinated

62 recorded cases of myocarditis

56 of those cases came after the second shot

Most of the affected were men under 30.

60 of the patients were treated and released from hospital in good condition

2 deaths (22-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man)

details had also been sent to the US FDA and CDC, who were also investigating

one possible reason for lack of similar findings in other countries was the low rate of vaccinations among young people

There is specific concern regarding the frequency of the occurrence observed in men under 30 in the days immediately after the second shot

At this stage, according to initial findings that still need to be verified, there is an impression that the number (of cases) is higher than would be expected, especially for those under 30

Overall findings, 1-in-100,000

Aged 16 – 30 years, 1-in-20,000

We cannot yet tell if there are more cases than normal or if there are similar numbers annually and the proximity is just a coincidence. 

Efforts to collect more data are continuing

Israel, children aged 12-15, when US Food and Drugs Administration approves

Health Ministry Director-General Chezy Levi

Once that age group has been vaccinated, the country will reach herd immunity

Therefore no need to vaccinate younger children

Vaccine choice, may be:

Younger women, Pfizer

Younger men, Janssen

## Vitamin D deficiency in India

Vitamin D deficiency in India
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6060930/

Prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency ranged from 40% to 99%

Most of the studies reporting a prevalence of 80%–90%

Prevalent in all the age groups and high-risk groups alike

Factors

Major source, synthesis in skin on exposure to sunlight

Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation, wavelength 290–320 nm

Fish, fortified food, supplements

Vegetables and grains are poor sources

Latitude, solar zenith angle, atmospheric pollution, ozone layer, and melanin pigmentation

Defining levels

Threshold levels of serum 25(OH) D required to optimize effects may vary in the various target organs

Deficiency, less than 20 ng/ml  (50 nmol/L)

Insufficiency, 21 – 29 ng/ml (52 - 72 nmol/L)

Sufficiency, more than 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/L)

Toxicity, more than 150 ng/ml (375 nmol/L)

Desirable and safe range of serum 25(OH) D level would be 30–100 ng/mL (75 – 250 nmol/L)

Metabolism

Vitamin D is needed to facilitate calcium absorption from the gut

PTH is secreted in response to low blood serum calcium

Maintains serum calcium by moving calcium from bones to blood

At less than 20 ng/mL of serum 25(OH) D, PTH is elevated to maintain serum calcium from bony reserves

At serum 25(OH) D levels of intestinal calcium absorption reaches its peak, 

and PTH levels continue to fall up to levels 30 ng/mL

Consequences of Vitamin D deficiency

Rickets

Muscle strength reduction

Autoimmune diseases

Cardiovascular diseases

Depression

Suicide

Parkinson’s

Cancer

Infections

Tuberculosis

Obesity

Diabetes mellitus type 2

Important for:

Immune function

Inflammation

Cell proliferation and differentiation

What to do

Create awareness among the public and healthcare providers about the importance of Vitamin D

and the consequences of deficiency

Indian diet generally fails to satisfy the daily requirement of Vitamin D for a normal adult

Need for fortifying various foods with Vitamin D, through national programs

This silent epidemic should be addressed appropriately with concrete public health action.

we can imagine the burden, this silent epidemic would cause the development of the country.
