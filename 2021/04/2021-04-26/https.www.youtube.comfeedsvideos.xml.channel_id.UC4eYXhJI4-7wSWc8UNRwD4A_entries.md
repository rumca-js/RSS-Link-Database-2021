The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lake Street Dive filmed its Tiny Desk (home) concert where the band is most at home: on stage at the “biggest little venue in NYC,” Pete’s Candy Store. All five band members managed to squeeze onto a stage no larger than the actual Tiny Desk to shine a spotlight on the Save Our Stages Act. Congress passed the $15 billion grant program last December as part of the $900 billion coronavirus relief bill. In the middle of the home concert, bassist Bridget Kearney recalls driving to the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn for a gig at Pete’s, then driving back to Boston the very same night, long before they ever sold out Radio City Music Hall on the other side of the East River. 

It’s hard to believe the band has released seven studio albums. Its latest, Obviously, provided the setlist for this intimate performance and prominently features the newest member and co-songwriter, keyboard and vocalist Akie Bermiss. Hopefully we’ll all be packed into tight venues again soon, adding the thunderous applause we’re all yearning to contribute. Until then, we’ll just have to settle for clapping at our screens.

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | April 26, 2021
When D.R.A.M. played the Tiny Desk back in 2017, he made a couple of things clear to us: His playfully dynamic personality was primed for the spotlight, and beneath the catchy hooks, there's a real singer waiting to come out. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he does a complete 180. "It's like a new beginning. Full circle. So this time, call me Shelley." he says, following the opening track, "Exposure." Everything is new. Silk pajamas and slippers replace the trench coat and plush beanie, and thanks to lifestyle changes, he's slimmed down quite a bit and goes by his government name now: Shelley.

The shift from lighthearted melodic hip-hop to full-on R&B crooner shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who's seen him perform live. It feels like it's his way of saying, "Now that I have your attention, allow me to introduce myself." We still get glimpses of the "Big Baby" here and there — the charm, a little bit of silliness, and the million-dollar grin — but other than that, it's grown folks business and vocally flawless performance. For the Shelley Show, he gathers a groovy band in front of a massive bookshelf and runs through selections, including the premiere of "Rich & Famous" from his upcoming self-titled project, due out on April 29, his late mother's birthday. If D.R.A.M. was the ploy to break into the music industry, then Shelley is the longevity play.
