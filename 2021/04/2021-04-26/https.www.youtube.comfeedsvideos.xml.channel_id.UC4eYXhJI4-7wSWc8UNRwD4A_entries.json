Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nJosh Rogosin | April 27, 2021\nLake Street Dive filmed its Tiny Desk (home) concert where the band is most at home: on stage at the \u201cbiggest little venue in NYC,\u201d Pete\u2019s Candy Store. All five band members managed to squeeze onto a stage no larger than the actual Tiny Desk to shine a spotlight on the Save Our Stages Act. Congress passed the $15 billion grant program last December as part of the $900 billion coronavirus relief bill. In the middle of the home concert, bassist Bridget Kearney recalls driving to the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn for a gig at Pete\u2019s, then driving back to Boston the very same night, long before they ever sold out Radio City Music Hall on the other side of the East River. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe the band has released seven studio albums. Its latest, Obviously, provided the setlist for this intimate performance and prominently features the newest member and co-songwriter, keyboard and vocalist Akie Bermiss. Hopefully we\u2019ll all be packed into tight venues again soon, adding the thunderous applause we\u2019re all yearning to contribute. Until then, we\u2019ll just have to settle for clapping at our screens.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Hypotheticals\"\n \u2022 \"Same Old News\"\n \u2022 \"Anymore\"\n \u2022 \"Making Do\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Rachael Price: vocals\n \u2022 Bridget Kearney: bass\n \u2022 Akie Bermiss: keyboards, vocals\n \u2022 Mike \"McDuck\" Olson: guitar\n \u2022 Mike Calabrese: drums\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Johnny Frohman\n \u2022 Audio: Jared Herman, Robin MacMillan\n \u2022 Camera Operator: Katie Sadler\n \u2022 Camera Operator: Connor Smith\n \u2022 Gaffer: Eric Bowers\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Bob Boilen\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #lakestreetdive", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_t55quR7x8", "date_published": "2021-04-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Shelley FKA DRAM: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | April 26, 2021\nWhen D.R.A.M. played the Tiny Desk back in 2017, he made a couple of things clear to us: His playfully dynamic personality was primed for the spotlight, and beneath the catchy hooks, there's a real singer waiting to come out. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he does a complete 180. \"It's like a new beginning. Full circle. So this time, call me Shelley.\" he says, following the opening track, \"Exposure.\" Everything is new. Silk pajamas and slippers replace the trench coat and plush beanie, and thanks to lifestyle changes, he's slimmed down quite a bit and goes by his government name now: Shelley.\n\nThe shift from lighthearted melodic hip-hop to full-on R&B crooner shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who's seen him perform live. It feels like it's his way of saying, \"Now that I have your attention, allow me to introduce myself.\" We still get glimpses of the \"Big Baby\" here and there \u2014 the charm, a little bit of silliness, and the million-dollar grin \u2014 but other than that, it's grown folks business and vocally flawless performance. For the Shelley Show, he gathers a groovy band in front of a massive bookshelf and runs through selections, including the premiere of \"Rich & Famous\" from his upcoming self-titled project, due out on April 29, his late mother's birthday. If D.R.A.M. was the ploy to break into the music industry, then Shelley is the longevity play.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Exposure\"\n\"The Lay Down\"\n\"Cooking With Grease\"\n\"Rich & Famous\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nShelley: vocals\nSlimWav: keys\nSensei Bueno: guitar\nKeith \"KJ\" Glover: drums\nTrey Mitchell: bass\nYuli: viola\nCrystal Carr: vocals\nDavid Fuller: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Junia Abaidoo, Carlon Ramong, Steve Othello\nAudio: Paul Katzman, Adrian Porter, Raul Lopez\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Maia Stern, Bob Boilen\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#shelley #dram #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xzmBkhyGxQ", "date_published": "2021-04-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
