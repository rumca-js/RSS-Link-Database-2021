Chivalry 2 is shaping up to be a intense, brutal and rather silly take on medieval siege warfare and open field battles. All of which can be fought through as multiple classes with a slew of weapons to dismember and decapitate. 

We played some of the closed beta over the weekend, taking the the field in massive sieges, and in team deathmatch tournaments. Fingers crossed we can take on more knights and archers again in another beta event before the June 8 release date.

With the upcoming launch of Mass Effect Legendary Edition, we decided to update and expand our look back at one of the greatest game series of all time.

Few video game franchises are as revered as BioWare's Mass Effect. When the first game launched in 2007 for the Xbox 360, players were taken aback by this bold new sci-fi universe, which was filled to the brim with choice and consequence, intriguing characters, intergalactic politics, and of course, romance. Over the years, it's certainly had its ups and downs, from the iconic Suicide Mission in Mass Effect 2 to the divisive ending of Mass Effect 3. 

With the impending launch of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition—a remaster of the original trilogy—we thought it was time to revisit our look back at the franchise, made before the release of Andromeda, and modernize it too. We've updated the video to include the fallout from Andromeda, the existence of the Legendary Edition, and the announcement of a brand new Mass Effect, which BioWare is currently working on. 

For more Mass Effect, including an in-depth look at the creation of the Suicide Mission from BioWare's Mac Walters, make sure to like this video and subscribe to GameSpot at youtube.com/gamespot. Mass Effect Legendary Edition launches on May 14 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
