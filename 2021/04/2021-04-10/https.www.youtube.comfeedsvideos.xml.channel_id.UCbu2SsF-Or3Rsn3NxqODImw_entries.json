Will Battlefield 6's reportedly futuristic setting help it take the throne in 2021?\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:28 - Verdansk goes 80s? \n04:17 - What's Going on With Zombies? \n06:11 - Back to WWII?\n09:45 - Can BF Do Better?\n11:35 - Good News & Your Comments \n\nAaron Sampson and Richie Bracamonte are here to talk about the\u00a0COD\u2019s\u00a0rumored\u00a0return to World\u00a0War\u00a0II.\u00a0This can be to the detriment of burnt-out Call of Duty fans, but could also\u00a0lead to\u00a0more\u00a0interest in Battlefield 6.\u00a0Rumored to take place in the 2030s and feature Battlefield 3-style multiplayer,\u00a0die-hard\u00a0Modern Warfare\u00a02019\u00a0fans may have a place to call home in 2021.\u00a0In the past few months, strange and seemingly dying support from Infinity Ward has left fans puzzled. New weapons like the RAAL Light machine gun and the\u00a0CX-9\u00a0submachine gun have been halfway added into\u00a0some\u00a0game modes, and 3 new maps were quietly added in only to be removed days later.\u00a0\n\nAnother leak has surfaced\u00a0revolving a new Warzone experience. An\u00a0unfinished trailer leaked that shows off\u00a0an 80s version\u00a0of\u00a0Verdansk. Strangely, it appeared to feature some assets from Cold War:\u00a0Prominently\u00a0the Duga 2 array from the game\u2019s optional final mission.\u00a0Aaron discusses his theories on how we\u2019re going to find ourselves in the 1980s. It definitely takes some suspension of disbelief and of\u00a0course, time traveling zombies.\u00a0But since nuclear weapons don\u2019t cause time travel, there\u2019s more to unpack than you might think.\u00a0\n\nSince zombies seem to be the glue holding the MW and Cold War together, Richie reflects on his fond memories of older\u00a0zombies\u00a0maps. As much as he cherishes them, he admits how much\u00a0harder they were to survive.
