90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated, mainly with mRNA vaccines including Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, 

without any safety concerns being raised.

Preferable for pregnant women in the UK to be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines where available. 

There is no evidence to suggest that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women, but more research is needed.

still advises that pregnant women should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their clinician

Brazil

Vinicius 
Speaking from Brazil here. The situation is absolutely out of control. There are thousands of people dying without even get the chance to be treated. We need help, our goverment simply doesn't do anything about it. I personally know more then 15 people that died from COVID.

Deaths, 371,889

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-56696907

Deaths in under 9s, 852

Including 518 under I year

0.58% of Brazil's 345,287 Covid deaths to date have been of 0-9 year olds

More than 2,000 children

Not all from MIS

Up to 6 weeks after acute infection

Dr Fatima Marinho from the University of São Paolo

Childhood deaths underreported

10 times more deaths by unexplained respiratory syndrome than in previous years

Actual deaths, 2,060 children under nine years old, including 1,302 babies

Factors

High case numbers

Limited testing in children

Poverty and access to care

Crowded poor accommodation

Background malnutrition

Late diagnosis and care

Currently no vaccination under 16 years

Differential presentation

A child has a lot more diarrhoea, a lot more abdominal pain, and chest pain, than the classic Covid picture. 

Because there is a delay in diagnosis, when the child arrives at the hospital they are in a serious condition and can end up complicating - and dying

Chile, vaccination contradiction?

Population 19 million

Well-developed public health system

Remote area coverage

Well-practiced vaccination pathways

Israel, UK, Chile, US

Population, 19 million

First dose, 7.5 million

Second dose, 5 million

But

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?utm_campaign=homeAdvegas1?

 Factors

Pandemic fatigue

Summer vacation travel

New variants

Chinese vaccine

Leonila Ferreira, ITU, Concepción

Patients younger on average than during the first wave

Continuing to let people travel abroad was a grave error

It introduced new variants which Chile has been slow to detect and contain

87% Sinovac’s CoronaVac data

60 million doses contracted over 3 years

(also some Pfizer)

10.5 million people followed, Feb. 2 to April 1

of whom 1.5 million first dose

2.5 million second dose

Two weeks after second dose

(28 days between primary and booster doses)

Symptomatic disease reduced by 67%

Deaths reduced by 80%

Hospitalizations reduced by 85%

ICU admission by reduced by 89%

Much lower after only one dose

Hospitals still stretched

Thinking about a third dose

Santiago locked down again

Now

First dose, 40%

Second dose, 27%

Down to 48 year olds

Sharp decrease in over 70 hospitalizations

Sustained rise in under 59s

E mail from CDC to CNN, Breakthrough infections

https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/949381?src=wnl_edit_tpal&uac=127834AR&impID=3316056&faf=1

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/14/health/breakthrough-infections-covid-vaccines-cdc/index.html

Vaccinated people who become infected = 5,800

About 1 in 13,275

At least 14 days after their final dose

Asymptomatic, 29%

Required hospitalization = 396 (1 in 194,444)

Deaths = 74 (1 in 1,040,540)

CDC currently investigating factors

May be more cases to report due to reporting lag

From 77 million fully vaccinated

(Fully vaccinated as of today = 80.6 million)

From trials

Pfizer/BioNTech, 95% effective in preventing symptomatic disease

Moderna, 94% effective in preventing symptomatic illness

Johnson & Johnson, 72% from US data

Characteristics of breakthroughs so far

40% of the infections were in people 60 or more

65%, were female

CDC is monitoring reported cases for clustering by patient demographics, geographic location, time since vaccination, vaccine type or lot number, and SARS-CoV-2 lineage

CDC also continues to recommend people who have been fully vaccinated should keep taking precautions in public places, like wearing a mask, staying at least six feet apart from others, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and washing their hands often

Dr. Carlos del Rio, Emory University School of Medicine

Less transmission means fewer breakthrough cases

There is currently a lot of transmission in many parts of the country

Vaccines will help decrease that

Get vaccinated as soon as you can and help control this pandemic

National Institutes of Health Director Dr Francis Collins

Allow more time for scientists to investigate links between the vaccine and blood clots

and whether or not certain groups of people are more susceptible

India, double mutation variant emerge

Hey john thanks for the update. I am from Delhi, India and I have contracted the virus. Situation in India is very bad. Most of the hospitals are already exhausted and many people are dying without treatment.

 The India variant, B.1.617

E484Q and L452R

First reported in India, late 2020

Aparna Mukherjee, Indian Council of Medical Research

has not been stamped as a ‘variant of concern’ so as to say that it is more lethal or more infectious

But

https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/resources/outbreak-tracker

Very low prevalence in January

April, 52% of samples sequenced

Maharashtra state, 60%

Has been detected in 10 other countries, US, UK (77 cases) Australia and New Zealand

(L452 from US data, 20% more transmissible, reduces antibody efficacy by more 50%)

William A. Haseltine, former professor, Harvard Medical School

The B.1.617 variant has all the hallmarks of a very dangerous virus

We must do all that is possible to identify its spread and to contain it

Doctors Without Borders

More than 12 months into Brazil’s covid-19 emergency, there is still no effective, centralized and coordinated public health response to the outbreak

The lack of political will to adequately respond to the pandemic is killing Brazilians in their thousands
