We received plenty of Partner Showcases, but no regular Nintendo Direct between September 2019 and February 2021. Typically, Nintendo Direct presentations are announced 1-2 days before airing, but with Nintendo returning to E3 in 2021, we have a solid timeframe of when new announcements will come.\n\nThere are a few things lingering from previous years we\u2019d like to see return at this year\u2019s show, like the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Metroid Prime 4, and Bayonetta 3. But what about other stuff? ARMS 2? Pikmin 4? N64 and GameCube Online? All that and more is touched on in this video.\n\nIf you want to know more about E3\u2019s return in 2021, then check out our show Console Crew, where Lucy James, Tamoor Hussain, and Jordan Ram\u00e9e discuss the news and if publishers even need E3 in a world where digital events are doing really well: https://youtu.be/xBhuNg2DMJI\n\n9 Things We Want In Zelda: Breath Of The Wild 2: https://youtu.be/wNUjaLb_YPM", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj6Q9t2fTGM", "date_published": "2021-04-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Elgato LED Strip | Is It Worth It?", "description": "Elgato LED Strips: https://bit.ly/3dbba1R\nPhillips Light Strips: https://bit.ly/3tcwyZT\n\nElgato is offering their own streamer-friendly LED light strips. Jean-Luc tests them out and sees how to compare to Philip's lightstrip.\n\nElgato continues their line of lighting products designed for the at-home streamer with the Elgato Light Strip, their take on RGBW lights. At a price of $60 USD, these offer competition with leading competitors like Philips, whose lightstrip runs $80. So let\u2019s take a look at how Elgato stacks up.\n\nWhat Comes in the box\nThe light strip itself runs a length of 78.74 inches, offers a brightness of up to 2000 lumens and the color range of 3500 - 6500 K. For comparison, Philip\u2019s light strips run the same length, has a lower lumen output of 1600, but offer a wider color range of 2000 - 6500 K. In short, Elgato offers a bit less color range but is brighter than the Philips.\n\nSetup\nThe setup is pretty straightforward. Simply apply your light where you want it. I went with placing it behind my computer desk, and then you\u2019ll need to install the Elgato control center app, either on your phone or computer. Sync the lights to your wifi and you\u2019re good to go. I did encounter an issue where after setting up the lights and the control center on my windows desktop would keep crashing every time I pulled it up. But after a fresh reinstall, I haven\u2019t had any issues.\n\nI prefer controlling them on my phone anyways because you can save six sets of colors as favorites for easy switching, which you can\u2019t do on the desktop version. However, if you happen to own a stream deck, you can program that to work with your light strips. You can set up a power button, color presets, and adjust brightness and temp. It's pretty neat but kind of a bummer that you need the stream deck if you want to set up presets using your desktop. At least the phone app is still an option.\n\nFlicker-Free\nOne of the big selling points of these lights is that there are flicker-free. Typically LED lights can flicker when shown on camera and you\u2019ll need to adjust your shutter speed to reduce this. You can see this happening here with the Philips light strip. Meanwhile, Elgato\u2019s do not. This makes these a better choice if you're using these lights to decorate a studio or the background of your streaming setup\n\nOutro\nIf you\u2019re someone like me that likes decorating your space with RGB lights, the Elgato Light Strip is a pretty easy recommendation from me. They are good quality, easy setup, and brighter than the offering from their main competitor Philips, in addition to being $20 cheaper. If you're looking for some LED strips, I would definitely consider these.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-AULSN0O_g", "date_published": "2021-04-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "COD WW2 Could Give Battlefield 6 the Edge", "description": "Call of Duty's rumored return to WWII is leaving series' fans with mixed emotions.

New weapons like the RAAL Light machine gun and the\u00a0CX-9\u00a0submachine gun have been halfway added into\u00a0some\u00a0game modes, and 3 new maps were quietly added in only to be removed days later.\u00a0\n\nAnother leak has surfaced\u00a0revolving a new Warzone experience. An\u00a0unfinished trailer leaked that shows off\u00a0an 80s version\u00a0of\u00a0Verdansk. Strangely, it appeared to feature some assets from Cold War:\u00a0Prominently\u00a0the Duga 2 array from the game\u2019s optional final mission.\u00a0Aaron discusses his theories on how we\u2019re going to find ourselves in the 1980s. It definitely takes some suspension of disbelief and of\u00a0course, time traveling zombies.\u00a0But since nuclear weapons don\u2019t cause time travel, there\u2019s more to unpack than you might think.\u00a0\n\nSince zombies seem to be the glue holding the MW and Cold War together, Richie reflects on his fond memories of older\u00a0zombies\u00a0maps. As much as he cherishes them, he admits how much\u00a0harder they were to survive.
