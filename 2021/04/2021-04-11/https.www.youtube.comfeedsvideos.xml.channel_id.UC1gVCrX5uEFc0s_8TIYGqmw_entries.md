"It's Eve's portable wireless 'phone - and won't hubby have a time when he has to carry one!"  L/S of the women - one holds the box and the other puts up an umbrella - presumably this acts as an aerial as a wire comes from the handle of the umbrella to the fire hydrant.  The women stand together and the woman holding the umbrella puts an ear piece against her ear.  M/S of a woman at a telephone exchange holding a microphone or stick telephone.  She speaks then turns around to a wind up gramophone.  She winds it, places the needle on the record and holds the microphone or mouthpiece to the record.  The two women smile and chat - they are listening to the record presumably.  An early mobile phone crossed with an early Sony walkman!  Excellent!
