Nintendo is officially confirmed to participate in E3 2021, and since Nintendo tends to bring out the big guns at E3, we've compiled the biggest things we want at this year's show.

E3 2020 didn’t happen, and Nintendo Direct shows became somewhat nonexistent for the entire year. We received plenty of Partner Showcases, but no regular Nintendo Direct between September 2019 and February 2021. Typically, Nintendo Direct presentations are announced 1-2 days before airing, but with Nintendo returning to E3 in 2021, we have a solid timeframe of when new announcements will come.

There are a few things lingering from previous years we’d like to see return at this year’s show, like the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Metroid Prime 4, and Bayonetta 3. But what about other stuff? ARMS 2? Pikmin 4? N64 and GameCube Online? All that and more is touched on in this video.

If you want to know more about E3’s return in 2021, then check out our show Console Crew, where Lucy James, Tamoor Hussain, and Jordan Ramée discuss the news and if publishers even need E3 in a world where digital events are doing really well: https://youtu.be/xBhuNg2DMJI

Elgato LED Strips: https://bit.ly/3dbba1R
Phillips Light Strips: https://bit.ly/3tcwyZT

Elgato is offering their own streamer-friendly LED light strips. Jean-Luc tests them out and sees how to compare to Philip's lightstrip.

Elgato continues their line of lighting products designed for the at-home streamer with the Elgato Light Strip, their take on RGBW lights. At a price of $60 USD, these offer competition with leading competitors like Philips, whose lightstrip runs $80. So let’s take a look at how Elgato stacks up.

What Comes in the box
The light strip itself runs a length of 78.74 inches, offers a brightness of up to 2000 lumens and the color range of 3500 - 6500 K. For comparison, Philip’s light strips run the same length, has a lower lumen output of 1600, but offer a wider color range of 2000 - 6500 K. In short, Elgato offers a bit less color range but is brighter than the Philips.

Setup
The setup is pretty straightforward. Simply apply your light where you want it. I went with placing it behind my computer desk, and then you’ll need to install the Elgato control center app, either on your phone or computer. Sync the lights to your wifi and you’re good to go. I did encounter an issue where after setting up the lights and the control center on my windows desktop would keep crashing every time I pulled it up. But after a fresh reinstall, I haven’t had any issues.

I prefer controlling them on my phone anyways because you can save six sets of colors as favorites for easy switching, which you can’t do on the desktop version. However, if you happen to own a stream deck, you can program that to work with your light strips. You can set up a power button, color presets, and adjust brightness and temp. It's pretty neat but kind of a bummer that you need the stream deck if you want to set up presets using your desktop. At least the phone app is still an option.

Flicker-Free
One of the big selling points of these lights is that there are flicker-free. Typically LED lights can flicker when shown on camera and you’ll need to adjust your shutter speed to reduce this. You can see this happening here with the Philips light strip. Meanwhile, Elgato’s do not. This makes these a better choice if you're using these lights to decorate a studio or the background of your streaming setup

Outro
If you’re someone like me that likes decorating your space with RGB lights, the Elgato Light Strip is a pretty easy recommendation from me. They are good quality, easy setup, and brighter than the offering from their main competitor Philips, in addition to being $20 cheaper. If you're looking for some LED strips, I would definitely consider these.

Call of Duty's rumored return to WWII is leaving series' fans with mixed emotions. Will Battlefield 6's reportedly futuristic setting help it take the throne in 2021?

Aaron Sampson and Richie Bracamonte are here to talk about the COD’s rumored return to World War II. This can be to the detriment of burnt-out Call of Duty fans, but could also lead to more interest in Battlefield 6. Rumored to take place in the 2030s and feature Battlefield 3-style multiplayer, die-hard Modern Warfare 2019 fans may have a place to call home in 2021. In the past few months, strange and seemingly dying support from Infinity Ward has left fans puzzled. New weapons like the RAAL Light machine gun and the CX-9 submachine gun have been halfway added into some game modes, and 3 new maps were quietly added in only to be removed days later. 

Another leak has surfaced revolving a new Warzone experience. An unfinished trailer leaked that shows off an 80s version of Verdansk. Strangely, it appeared to feature some assets from Cold War: Prominently the Duga 2 array from the game’s optional final mission. Aaron discusses his theories on how we’re going to find ourselves in the 1980s. It definitely takes some suspension of disbelief and of course, time traveling zombies. But since nuclear weapons don’t cause time travel, there’s more to unpack than you might think. 

Since zombies seem to be the glue holding the MW and Cold War together, Richie reflects on his fond memories of older zombies maps. As much as he cherishes them, he admits how much harder they were to survive. If you’re enjoying these chats about Call of Duty, speak up! Your comments can lead to more discussions about future COD topics and have a chance to be featured in a future episode!
