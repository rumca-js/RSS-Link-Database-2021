The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Mano Sundaresan | April 29, 2021
The first song Rod Wave performs in his Tiny Desk concert comes with a bit of a wink. The St. Petersburg, Fla., rapper interpolates Drake's "Over My Dead Body," the delicate intro to Take Care. Like Drake, Rod Wave makes sad, melodic rap music. But his feels removed from the Canadian superstar's lineage. His cadences are more in step with the full-bodied crooning of Southern rap giants like Kevin Gates and Lil Boosie. It's been said that Rod Wave could be an R&B or blues singer in another era. With this Tiny Desk concert, anchored by the interplay of flute, piano, bass and drums, he seems to suggest: Why not this one?

Cast against a leafy, luxurious backdrop, Rod and his band deliver fiery renditions of three songs off his new album SoulFly, as well as his 2020 hit record "Rags2Riches." When he sings — about coming out of the trenches, about being away from his loved one, about perceptions of his artistry — you can feel the weight of those thoughts pouring out of every line. You can see it, too, in the way he shuts his eyes, grips the mic, sways back and forth. In light of his massive success — he's quite clearly one of the biggest rappers in the country right now — he could've treated this Tiny Desk like a victory lap, but instead, he brings the same heart and earnestness that's made him so beloved.

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Robin HIlton | April 28, 2021
Watch this stunning "home" Tiny Desk performance from Son Lux and you might conclude the band members live together in an all-white universe without walls or boundaries. But it's all an illusion. In fact, guitarist Rafiq Bhatia, drummer Ian Chang and singer-keyboardist Ryan Lott, who started Son Lux as a solo project back in 2008, each shot their own, separate video with their iPhones, at different times, at their homes scattered across different states. So did the guest vocalists, Nina Moffitt and Kiah Victoria. Editor Evan Chapman then stitched all the videos together.

The effect is dizzying and sometimes disorienting as superimposed images flicker and warble over one another against Bhatia's skittering guitar lines. Everything is bent and a little off – intentionally, not because of the production challenges – and nothing sounds quite like you expect it to. Watch Bhatia's all-too-short solo on "Only" or Lott as he walks his fingers over the keys near the beginning of "Vacancy." Together – and alone – they've perfectly captured the upside-down world we've been living in this past year, where the lines between what's real and imagined are blurred, all sense of place fades into the ether and the normally predictable rhythms of life come undone.

The setlist for this performance includes a song from each of the band's last three albums, a trilogy released over the past eight months, called Tomorrows I, II and III.
