US to EU travel

Ursula von der Leyen, vaccinated US tourists should be able to travel the EU summer

The Americans, as far as I see, use European Medicines Agency-approved vaccines

This will enable free movement and travel to the European Union

Restrictions to be lifted depending on the epidemiological situation in the US

European Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breto

EU has procured enough doses of vaccine to achieve herd immunity by mid-July

New deal with Pfizer for 1.8 billion doses (now to 2023)

Immune escape, looking good in India

Data up to April 21

Extremely low breakthrough infection rate

India data, 0.02% to 0.04% of vaccinated people falling ill

United States rates, 0.008 %

One dose of COVID-19 vaccine can cut household transmission by up to half

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/one-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-can-cut-household-transmission-by-up-to-half

Being vaccinated significantly reduces risk of infection, hospitalisation, death

Reduced risk of developing symptomatic infection, 4 weeks after one dose of either vaccine, 60 to 65%

Those who do become infected 3 weeks after receiving one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine

Were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus on to their household contacts

Similar results expected, shared accommodations, prisons

Based on

57,000 contacts from 24,000 households

Compared with 1 million contacts of unvaccinated cases

Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock

comprehensive real-world data showing vaccines cut transmission

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE

even if you have been vaccinated, it is really important that you continue to act like you have the virus, practise good hand hygiene and follow social distancing guidance.

Israel, 5 million people fully vaccinated

62 recorded cases of myocarditis

Mostly after second dose

Most in men under 30

Now cases in US military

Defense Department, tracking 14 cases myocarditis

Temporal association 

2,713,640 COVID-19 vaccines, myocarditis in 0.000516%
 
1 in 193,831

Developed after receiving either Pfizer or Moderna

One patient, tested positive for COVID-19 three months ago

Then developed myocarditis after first dose of vaccine

Remaining 13 patients developed myocarditis after their second vaccine doses

Moderna, 11 cases

Pfizer, 3 cases

All developed chest pain 12 to 96 hours after vaccination.

Steve Beynon, 30, developed myocarditis after second dose of Moderna

Hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in February

Nearly three days in the ICU

Has since performed his National Guard duties

Marcus Weisgerber, 39, developed myocarditis after his second Pfizer shot

Two days in the hospital

 https://vaers.hhs.gov

45 reports of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccines

Majority of cases occurred after the second dose

Pfizer, 19 cases reported after the Pfizer vaccine and 26 after the 

Moderna, 26 cases

62%, in men, mostly 20 to 45

Vigorous exercise after vaccination?

Vaccine choice, may be:

Younger women, better with Pfizer (due to very small risk of TTS with Janssen, as recommended by FDA)

Younger men, better with Janssen (due to possible links with myocarditis in younger men in Israel and US military)
