Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nMano Sundaresan | April 29, 2021\nThe first song\u00a0Rod Wave\u00a0performs in his Tiny Desk concert comes with a bit of a wink. The St. Petersburg, Fla., rapper interpolates\u00a0Drake's \"Over My Dead Body,\" the delicate intro to\u00a0Take Care. Like Drake, Rod Wave makes sad, melodic rap music. But his feels removed from the Canadian superstar's lineage. His cadences are more in step with the full-bodied crooning of Southern rap giants like\u00a0Kevin Gates\u00a0and Lil Boosie. It's been said that Rod Wave could be an R&B or blues singer in another era. With this Tiny Desk concert, anchored by the interplay of flute, piano, bass and drums, he seems to suggest: Why not this one?\n\nCast against a leafy, luxurious backdrop, Rod and his band deliver fiery renditions of three songs off his new album\u00a0SoulFly, as well as his 2020 hit record \"Rags2Riches.\" When he sings \u2014 about coming out of the trenches, about being away from his loved one, about perceptions of his artistry \u2014 you can feel the weight of those thoughts pouring out of every line. You can see it, too, in the way he shuts his eyes, grips the mic, sways back and forth. In light of his massive success \u2014 he's quite clearly one of the biggest rappers in the country right now \u2014 he could've treated this Tiny Desk like a victory lap, but instead, he brings the same heart and earnestness that's made him so beloved.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"OMDB\"\n \u2022 \"Rags2Riches\"\n \u2022 \"Street Runner\" (featuring Ruth B.)\n \u2022 \"Don't Forget\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Rod Wave: vocals\n \u2022 Gil Smith: piano\n \u2022 Hosny Franck: drums\n \u2022 Tomoka Nomura-Jarvis: flute, saxophone\n \u2022 Franckelson Brunot: bass guitar, upright bass\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Tyler Benz, Justin Staple, Albert Lago, Christian Cashmir, Tom Jordan, Tim Buttner, Andrew Ortoski\n \u2022 Audio: Maceo Price for Skyballer Productions\n \u2022 All The Smoke & Litewave Media\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producers: Bobby Carter, Mano Sundaresan\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Bob Boilen\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#rodwave #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR7JdLO_y5s", "date_published": "2021-04-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Son Lux: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nRobin HIlton | April 28, 2021\nWatch this stunning \"home\" Tiny Desk performance from Son Lux and you might conclude the band members live together in an all-white universe without walls or boundaries. But it's all an illusion. In fact, guitarist Rafiq Bhatia, drummer Ian Chang and singer-keyboardist Ryan Lott, who started Son Lux as a solo project back in 2008, each shot their own, separate video with their iPhones, at different times, at their homes scattered across different states. So did the guest vocalists, Nina Moffitt and Kiah Victoria. Editor Evan Chapman then stitched all the videos together.\n\nThe effect is dizzying and sometimes disorienting as superimposed images flicker and warble over one another against Bhatia's skittering guitar lines. Everything is bent and a little off \u2013 intentionally, not because of the production challenges \u2013 and nothing sounds quite like you expect it to. Watch Bhatia's all-too-short solo on \"Only\" or Lott as he walks his fingers over the keys near the beginning of \"Vacancy.\" Together \u2013 and alone \u2013 they've perfectly captured the upside-down world we've been living in this past year, where the lines between what's real and imagined are blurred, all sense of place fades into the ether and the normally predictable rhythms of life come undone.\n\nThe setlist for this performance includes a song from each of the band's last three albums, a trilogy released over the past eight months, called Tomorrows I, II and III.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Prophecy\"\n\"Only\"\n\"Vacancy\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nRyan Lott: vocals, synth\nRafiq Bhatia: guitar\nIan Chang: drums\nNina Moffitt: vocals\nKiah Victoria: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Evan Chapman, Four/Ten Media\nAudio: Brandon Peralta and Ryan Lott\nMastering: Brandon Peralta\nGuitars and Nina Moffitt's vocals recorded by Todd Carder at The Bunker Studio, New York.
