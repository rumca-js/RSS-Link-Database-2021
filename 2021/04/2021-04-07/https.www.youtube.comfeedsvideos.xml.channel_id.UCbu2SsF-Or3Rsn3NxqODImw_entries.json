Let's take a look back at its appearances throughout Call of Duty's history. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:14 - COD4: Modern Warfare\n00:44 - Modern Warfare 2\n01:15 - Black Ops 1\n02:02 - Modern Warfare 3\u00a0\n02:40 - Black Ops 2\u00a0\n03:09 - Black Ops 2 Zombies\n03:34 - Advanced Warfare\u00a0\n04:12 - Modern Warfare Remastered\u00a0\n04:42 - Call of Duty Mobile\n05:14 - Modern Warfare 2019\u00a0\n06:23 - Modern Warfare 2 Remastered\n07:10 - Black Ops Cold War\u00a0\n07:30 - Black Ops Cold War Zombies\n\nThe AK-47 is one of Call of Duty\u2019s most revered assault rifles. In and out of the series, the gun represents all things villainous and badass. The assault rifle has been featured in several of main series\u2019 entries including the entire Modern Warfare saga. In later games however we see less of it within the Black Ops\u2019 futuristic titles. Its return to Modern Warfare 2019 and Cold War were no surprise because love it or hate it, the AK47 is legendary.\n\nDespite being produced in the late 40s, we didn\u2019t see much of the AK in early Call of Duty games like 1, 2, and 3. It wasn\u2019t until the WWII craze ended that we saw the Russian rifle popularized in video games. Beginning with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, most enemy forces in the modern-day setting are equipped with AK, while domestic forces like the Army Rangers always carried the M4 or M-16A4. This (and the entire 1980s) popularized the rifle as the ultimate \u201cbad guy\u201d weapon.\n\nIn futuristic titles like Black Ops 3, we hear less and less from the AK-47. Instead, most of these titles feature the AN-94 or KN-44 platform series. Over the years, the AK has also been featured in the popular Black Ops Zombies mode. When pack-a-punched for extra firepower, the AK is called \u201cReznov\u2019s Revenge\u201d- an homage to World at War and Black Ops 1\u2019s Victor Reznov.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVIxNn_o3k", "date_published": "2021-04-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Outriders: 10+ Guaranteed Legendaries", "description": "Legendaries in Outriders are somewhat difficult to come by, but they have fun and unique abilities, so they\u2019re absolutely worth trying to get your hands on.
