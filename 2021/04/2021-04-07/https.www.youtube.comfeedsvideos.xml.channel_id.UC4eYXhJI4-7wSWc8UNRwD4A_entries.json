Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes craft a bed of hip-hop, industrial music and noisy experimentalism, then set loose rapper Daveed Diggs, whose violent imagery summons '90s horrorcore and a thousand bloody movies. The band's last two album titles \u2014\u00a0There Existed an Addiction to Blood\u00a0and\u00a0Visions of Bodies Being Burned\u00a0\u2014 offer up a sense of the vibe, but Diggs' gift for rapid-fire wordplay also acts as a leavening agent. The guy\u00a0won a Tony Award for playing Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette in\u00a0Hamilton, and he still knows how to sell every word that leaves his lips.\n\nSo, yeah, multitudes. Plus, in this video, a few surprises to trick your eye and help pull you into a clever and disorienting world of sound.\n\nSET LIST\n \u25aa \"Something Underneath\"\n \u25aa \"Bout That\"\n \u25aa \"Check the Lock\"\n \u25aa \"Shooter\"\n \u25aa \"The Show\"\n \u25aa \"Nothing Is Safe\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u25aa Daveed Diggs: vocals\n \u25aa William Hutson: beats, effects\n \u25aa Jonathan Snipes: beats, effects\n \u25aa Chukwudi Hodge: drums\n\nCREDITS\n \u25aa Video: Cristina Bercovitz, Erin Bates, Daveed Diggs\n \u25aa Audio: clipping.\n \u25aa Tiny furniture fabricated by: Cristina Bercovitz\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u25aa Producer: Bob Boilen\n \u25aa Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u25aa Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u25aa Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u25aa Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame\n \u25aa Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n \u25aa Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #clipping", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn6S9NTpPvk", "date_published": "2021-04-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: DUCKWRTH", "description": "Every year, NPR Music participates in the SXSW music festival, whether it's curating a stage or simply attending hundreds of shows at the annual event in Austin, Texas.

Y'all ain't got no choice!\"\n\nThe dynamic R&B singer proceeded to debut two exclusives: a slow jam titled \"make u go,\" which he dedicates to the \"lovers and freaks,\" and the upbeat \"Birthday Suit,\" which KCRW astutely compared to Estelle's \"American Boy.\"\n\nThe new material wasn't the only thing that made this Tiny Desk such a treat. For this funky and flamboyant performance, DUCKWRTH dressed his backing band entirely in white and switched up the lighting for each song so that the hue matched the mood he was laying down.\n\nDUCKWRTH has long been a creative soul. He spoke with NPR in 2019 about growing up in a Pentecostal household in South Central Los Angeles, and how those two worlds helped shape his journeys between R&B and West Coast G-funk.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Kiss U Right Now\"\n\"make u go\"\n\"Birthday Suit\"\n\"Super Good\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nDUCKWRTH: vocals\nJustin \"Jhawk\" Hawkins: guitar\nDarryl Staves Jr.: drums\nSolomon \"Solo\" Smith: bass\nDevin Smith: keys\nAmber Olivia Kiner: vocals\nOlivia Walker: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: BT Studios, Jonathan Salmon, Lopes\nAudio: Lucas Palmieri\nMixed by: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director - Abdi Ibrahim\nDirector of Photography - Adam Linssen\nSpecial Thanks: Beehive Studios\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #DUCKWRTH", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-PlG-SU8sc", "date_published": "2021-04-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
