Dessa is our Minnesota Music Month artist of the day for Wednesday, April 8. 

In March of 2019, Dessa and the Grammy-winning Minnesota Orchestra joined forces to record "Sound the Bells." They sold out two nights at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, wired it with microphones, and put on an epic show full of rap bangers, infectious pop songs, tragic ballads, costume changes, and a little Bach. But how do hip-hop tracks get transformed into compositions that can be played by more than 75 classical musicians? (Spoiler: it involves arranger extraordinaire Andy Thompson and more than a thousand pages of scores.) Is it true that conductor Sarah Hicks uses a baton molded specially for her hand? (IT IS.)

The Making of Sound the Bells pulls back the curtain to explore the workings of this ambitious project through stories, images, and live performance from a string quartet composed of Minnesota Orchestra players.

Watch these live performances featuring a string quartet, Dessa, and four vocalists.

## Listen to Looch: "Tina" is a story of survival and of a revered career

This week, Mary Lucia discusses "Tina," the documentary about Tina Turner that just debuted on HBO. "It is what I would believe Tina Turner hopes to be the punctuation at the end of a very long, brutal, traumatic story," Mary says.

"I don't think Turner tries to pretend that she's come out the other side all shiny and happy," Mary contineus. "She truly expresses that this was her hand dealt in life, and she is dealing with it the best way she knows how. There's something very tender and heartbreaking about all of this, even though it's the story of survival; of certainly of a revered career.

"Tina Turner always wanted to be on the level of the Rolling Stones or anybody else that could fill a stadium — and she did it. This film contains great footage, and there's some real honesty in what Tina Turner says about her life and how she views it."

See more of what Mary Lucia has to say about "Tina" in the video above. "Tina" is co-directed by Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin, and it's streaming now on HBO.
