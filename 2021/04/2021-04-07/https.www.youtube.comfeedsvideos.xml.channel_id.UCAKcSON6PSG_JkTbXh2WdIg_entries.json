But how do hip-hop tracks get transformed into compositions that can be played by more than 75 classical musicians? (Spoiler: it involves arranger extraordinaire Andy Thompson and more than a thousand pages of scores.) Is it true that conductor Sarah Hicks uses a baton molded specially for her hand? (IT IS.)\n\nThe Making of Sound the Bells pulls back the curtain to explore the workings of this ambitious project through stories, images, and live performance from a string quartet composed of Minnesota Orchestra players.\n\nWatch these live performances featuring a string quartet, Dessa, and four vocalists.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Good Grief\"\n5:02 \"Fighting Fish\"\n8:10 \"Dixon's Girl\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nDessa\nLazerbeak: Doomtree producer/album executive producer\nAndy Thompson: Arranger/album executive producer\nSarah Hicks: Live at Orchestra Hall Conductor\nSarah Grimes: violin\nBen Odhner: violin\nSam Bergman: viola\nPitnarry Shin: cello\nAby Wolf: Vocal Director/singer\nAshley Dubose: singer\nMatthew Santos: singer\nCameron Kinghorn: singer\n\nCREDITS\nAudio: Veronica Rodriguez, Cameron Wiley\nVideo: Mary Mathis, Nate Ryan\nEvent Production: Andrea Swensson, Ali Lozoff, Natalie Roman, Casey Collins\n\nFIND MORE:\n2011 Fitzgerald Theater concert: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/11/08/dessa-live-fitz\n2013 Fitzgerald Theater concert: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/07/10/dessa-fitzgerald-theater-performance-broadcast\n2018 MPR Forum session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/02/21/dessa-the-making-of-chime\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#dessa #soundthebells #mnorchestra", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brfbTJjASUA", "date_published": "2021-04-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Valerie June - Virtual Session", "description": "Valerie June connects with The Current's Mary Lucia to play a few songs from her latest record, 'The Moon and Stars: Prescriptions for Dreamers', plus an older favorite.
