Hello and welcome to TUE-I mean Wednesday Newsday! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news. Today I talk about a variety of topics from the Facebook data breach, to the NEW Pico neo 3 that I am super interested in, and of course, the Oculus Rift 2 that caused a TON of drama and was eventually cancelled for the Rift S.

I hope you enjoy! I want to hear your theories as to how you think VR would have gone if the Rift 2 was actually released.
