Edward Snowden Calls out a alleged Ponzi Scheme Promoter LIVE during a webinar that Sunil Tulsiani had produced for a club called the Private Investment Club. Edward Snowden had been brought on in order to promote the private investment club, but instead called out the fact that Sunil Tulsiani had been previously accused of promoting a Ponzi Scheme.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.
