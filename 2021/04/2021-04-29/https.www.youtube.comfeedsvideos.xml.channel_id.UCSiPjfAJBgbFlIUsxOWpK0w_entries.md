 Post-Daft-Punk-break-up, we are all the more inspired to cover their music. In fact, it feels like a responsibility now. We owe it to you, to the universe, to the one who blew up, and the one who walked into the sunset. This one is for you.

LYRICS

Doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling alright
Everybody will be dancing tonight

Doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling alright
Everybody will be dancing tonight

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right

Doing it right
oo-ooh
Doing it right
oo-ooh
Doing it right
oo-ooh
Everybody will be dancing 
And be doing it right

Doing it right
oo-ooh
Doing it right
oo-ooh
Doing it right
oo-ooh
Everybody will be dancing 
And be doing it right

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light

Doing it right
oo-ooh
Doing it right
oo-ooh
Doing it right
oo-ooh
Everybody will be dancing 
And be doing it right

Doing it right
