Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nLyndsey McKenna | April 14, 2021\nA few years ago, some of us on the NPR Music team stumbled upon a copy of Demi Lovato's 2013 book, Staying Strong: 365 Days A Year. Reading Lovato's heartfelt daily reflections became a workday habit; her transparency and vulnerability made us ardent admirers who wanted nothing but the very best for Demi.\n\nWe made it our mission to get Demi to the Tiny Desk, and though the pandemic had other plans, Lovato's Tiny Desk (home) concert was worth the wait. Recorded on a sunny spring day in her Los Angeles backyard, Lovato begins with a moving rendition of \"Tell Me You Love Me\" from her 2017 record of the same name, accompanied by subtle, sparse keys. She continues her set with the title tracks from her recently-released studio album, Dancing With The Devil...The Art Of Starting Over. On both tracks, Lovato's voice feels stabilizing and grounding; there's a sense of clarity and purpose in its power.\n\nWhen interviewed by NPR's Ailsa Chang back in 2017, Demi Lovato said, \"I think I've lived a lot of life.\" Through both her struggles and successes, Lovato's shown all sides of herself \u2013 the confident and unapologetic star, but also the complexities of recovery \u2013 inviting us on her journey in a deeply personal way. Her intimate (home) concert feels like a natural extension of that sincerity.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Tell Me You Love Me\"\n\"The Art Of Starting Over\"\n\"Dancing With The Devil\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nDemi Lovato: vocals\nSteven \"Styles\" Rodriguez: keys\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Mike Drew\nEditor: Aaron Kroger\nEngineer/Shader: David Vega\nCamera Operator: Austin Wavra\nCamera Operator: Noel Galan\nCamera Operator: Drew Welker\nAssistant Camera: Lawrence Montemayor\nAudio : Steven \"Styles\" Rodriguez\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Bob Boilen\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #demilovato", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehw07lXL1AY", "date_published": "2021-04-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
