Dua Saleh is our featured artist for April 13 as part of Minnesota Music Month. Here are three performances recorded by Saleh for The Local Show in February of 2019.

Saleh released their EP Nūr on Jan. 3, 2019, and its five songs total more than a sum of their parts. As Saleh told Local Show host Andrea Swensson, the poetic lyrics are a direct result of Qur'an study and Thursday nights spent at the TruArtSpeaks open mic at Golden Thyme in St. Paul. The music stems from an online connection with St. Paul-based producer Psymun (thest4ndard, the Weeknd).

Psymun's not the only one in Saleh's unit of dedicated Twin Cities musicians. Fellow thest4ndard member Corbin contributed background vocals to "Warm Pants," SinGrinch co-produced that same lead single, and Velvet Negroni contributed a lovely guest verse to "Survival." Producer/engineer Mike Frey mixed "Kickflip" and "Sugar Mama" and supported Saleh at The Current on beats and electric guitar.

In short order, Saleh has become one of the most in-demand voices in Minneapolis, admired by online fans, critics, and fellow musicians alike. In January 2019, Pitchfork published a favorable review of Nūr, which Saleh said meant a lot. "They could've featured any other artist, and the fact that they took time to even think about us —" Saleh said at the time, shaking their head. "We weren't even notified about it beforehand. [Writer] Paul [Thompson] just posted it, and I was like, 'Oh my God.'"

## Low - three songs at The Current (2015)

Duluth rock band Low are Monday's featured artists for Minnesota Music Month. Here's a session by Low recorded back in September 2015, just days after the release of their 11th album, "Ones and Sixes."

Low have played together since 1993, but frontman Alan Sparkhawk has a simple formula for the way the band members have sustained their passion and creativity for more than two decades. "Luckily we've always been pretty naïve," Sparhawk said, "and [we] didn't really know what we're doing and always felt like we're learning."

For "Ones and Sixes," Low recorded at Justin Vernon's April Base studio in Eau Claire, Wis., and worked with producer and engineer BJ Burton. "We've bveen able to work with a lot of great people," Sparhawk said. "That, in a lot of ways, is sort of a key. You kind of always need to find a new way, a new filter to try to see what you do will end up being."

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "What Part of Me"
3:09 "No Comprende"
8:13 "DJ"

PERSONNEL
Alan Sparhawk – guitar, vocals
Mimi Parker – drums, vocals
Steve Garrington – bass
