Here are three performances recorded by Saleh for The Local Show in February of 2019.\n\nSaleh released their EP N\u016br on Jan. 3, 2019, and its five songs total more than a sum of their parts. As Saleh told Local Show host Andrea Swensson, the poetic lyrics are a direct result of Qur'an study and Thursday nights spent at the TruArtSpeaks open mic at Golden Thyme in St. Paul. The music stems from an online connection with St. Paul-based producer Psymun (thest4ndard, the Weeknd).\n\nPsymun's not the only one in Saleh's unit of dedicated Twin Cities musicians. Fellow thest4ndard member Corbin contributed background vocals to \"Warm Pants,\" SinGrinch co-produced that same lead single, and Velvet Negroni contributed a lovely guest verse to \"Survival.\" Producer/engineer Mike Frey mixed \"Kickflip\" and \"Sugar Mama\" and supported Saleh at The Current on beats and electric guitar.\n\nIn short order, Saleh has become one of the most in-demand voices in Minneapolis, admired by online fans, critics, and fellow musicians alike. In January 2019, Pitchfork published a favorable review of N\u016br, which Saleh said meant a lot. \"They could've featured any other artist, and the fact that they took time to even think about us \u2014\" Saleh said at the time, shaking their head. \"We weren't even notified about it beforehand. [Writer] Paul [Thompson] just posted it, and I was like, 'Oh my God.'\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Warm Pants\"\n5:05 \"Kickflip\"\n8:12 \"Sugar Mama\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nDua Saleh \u2013 vocals\nMike Frey \u2013 keys, guitar, beats\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan, Minju Kim\nAudio: John Miller\nProduction: Jesse Wiza\n\nFIND MORE:\n2017 \"You Need to Know\" profile: https://blog.thecurrent.org/2017/07/you-need-to-know-dua-a-poet-finding-their-singing-voice/\n2018 interview: https://blog.thecurrent.org/2019/01/interview-dua-saleh-talks-nur-psymun-and-2018-takeaways/\n2019 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/02/18/dua-saleh-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2020 feature article about Saleh on \"Sex Education\": https://blog.thecurrent.org/2020/10/dua-salehs-going-to-be-on-sex-education-and-it-just-makes-sense/\n2020 interview: https://blog.thecurrent.org/2020/06/dua-saleh-on-body-cast-their-powerful-new-song-about-police-brutality/\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#duasaleh", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwxffnayzeE", "date_published": "2021-04-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Emilio Estevez on returning to the role of Gordon Bombay in 'The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers'", "description": "Emilio Estevez joined The Current's Jill Riley for a conversation about returning to the iconic role of Gordon Bombay in the new Disney+ series 'The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers.'
