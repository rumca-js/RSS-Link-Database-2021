During this live stream, I'll attempt to get OctoPrint set up on a Raspberry Pi 4 so I can have more control over my Ender 3 V2 printer. I'll also be streaming directly over Starlink, through SpaceX's satellite constellation using Dishy on my roof!

Will the stream work? Will my 3D Printer start printing spaghetti? Who knows! Find out LIVE during this stream.

Last video I tried sneaking Dishy out to a farm and failed. Today I'm installing Dishy on my roof, permanently!

In this video I walk through the entire install process for SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet on my asphalt shingle roof, using Starlink's Volcano Mount, and I run the cable into my brick house and through the basement, connecting everything together for a fast new Internet connection!
