Joint CDC and FDA Statement on Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, together with low platelets

Some sort of immune response

6 cases from 6.8 million doses

Look out for, severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath within three weeks of vaccination

Paul A.Offit, vaccine specialist, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia

I think it’s the prudent thing to do 

I think it’s real — this is a rare, but real association

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), meets today

EMA also investigating, delaying European rollout

Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner, Food and Drug Administration

One reason for the pause, health professionals must know not to use heparin

All six cases in the US, occurred among women, 18 to 48

6 – 13 days after vaccination

Of the 6, 1 death and 1 critical

Of the 6, 2 discharged

The person in critical condition was (reportedly) treated with heparin

Peter Marks, director of the FDA's centre for biologics evaluation and research

hesitate to call it a class effect related to adenovirus vector vaccines

It's plainly obvious to us already that what we're seeing with the Jansen vaccines looks very similar to what is being seen with the AstraZeneca vaccine

AstraZeneca, chimpanzee adenoviral vector 

Janssen, human adenoviral vector vaccine

I can't make some broad statement yet, but obviously they are from the same general class of viral vectors

Scale of the problem

100 million doses to US end of May

can produce 1 billion doses globally by the end of the year

has agreed to sell 500 million doses to developing nations via Covax purchasing agreement

agreed to sell up to 400 million to African countries

Turkey

WHO latest COVAX news release

https://www.who.int/news/item/08-04-2021-covax-reaches-over-100-economies-42-days-after-first-international-delivery

First international delivery, Ghana, 24 February 2021

Now delivered vaccines to over 100 economies

So far, 38 million doses of vaccines

AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech and Serum Institute of India

Delays in planned deliveries for March and April

As of 13th April

https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/

797 doses given in 154 countries

Now, 18 million per day

For a further 7 billion people, needing 2 doses

Over two years

WHO, Solidarity trials

12 000 patients in 500 hospital sites in over 30 countries

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments

found that all 4 treatments evaluated 

remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon

had little or no effect on overall

mortality

initiation of ventilation

duration of hospital stay in hospitalized patients

The Solidarity Trial is considering evaluating other treatments, to continue the search for effective COVID-19 therapeutics

So far, only corticosteroids have been proven effective against severe and critical COVID-19.
WHO advises that ivermectin only be used to treat COVID-19 within clinical trials

UK bases Recovery trial

https://www.recoverytrial.net

https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m2670

Azithromycin

https://www.recoverytrial.net/results/azithromycin-results

RECOVERY trial finds no benefit from azithromycin in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 

Convalescent Plasma

https://www.recoverytrial.net/results/convalescent-plasma

Data Monitoring Committee saw no convincing evidence that further recruitment would provide conclusive proof of worthwhile mortality benefit 

Dexamethasone

https://www.recoverytrial.net/files/recovery_dexamethasone_statement_160620_v2final.pdf

Dexamethasone reduces death by up to one third in hospitalised patients with severe respiratory complications of COVID-19 

Hydroxychloroquine

https://www.recoverytrial.net/files/hcq-recovery-statement-050620-final-002.pdf

No clinical benefit from use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 

Lopinavir-ritonavir

https://www.recoverytrial.net/results/lopinavar-results

No clinical benefit from use of lopinavir-ritonavir in hospitalised COVID-19 patients

Tocilizumab

https://www.recoverytrial.net/results/tocilizumab-results

Tocilizumab reduces deaths when given to hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19

Shortens time until patients are successfully discharged from hospital

Reduces the need for a mechanical ventilator

Pharmacy Magazine, ivermectin article

https://www.pharmacymagazine.co.uk/ivermectin-for-covid-19-a-cheap-drug-with-a-remarkable-effect

Introduced in 1981

Antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties

Some 4 billion doses have been taken over the past 40 years

Good safety record with minimal toxic effects

WHO Model List of Essential Medicines as a 3mg tablet

Countries now including ivermectin in their Covid-19 management strategies

Greece, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Slovakia, Czech Republic

Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care (FLCCC) Alliance

Called for the rapid introduction of ivermectin to stem the tide of infections

Prophylactic treatment can be given with two doses of 0.2mg/kg, 48 hours apart, once a month. 

For early out-patient treatment, a daily dose of 0.2mg/kg for a maximum of five days is recommended

In the UK, the best way forward would be for the MHRA to authorise use of ivermectin for prophylaxis and treatment of Covid-19 on the basis of the published evidence to date. 

Next, the drug could be made available through community pharmacies either using a PGD or by making ivermectin a P medicine

Ivermectin would then help to save lives and reduce suffering until the majority of the population can be vaccinated

Failure to use a cheap, safe drug that reduces the severity and duration of infection as well as the risks of death and transmission seems incomprehensible
