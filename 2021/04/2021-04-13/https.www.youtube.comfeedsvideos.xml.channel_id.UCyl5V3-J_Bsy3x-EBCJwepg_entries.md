Kyle and Ethan are joined by standup comedian Trevor Andersen, who viewers may recognize from some of our sketches on YouTube. They talk about Satanic musicians who are or were in the closet of following Jesus and how people who are on the side of every major corporation now think that they are part of the resistance. Thereâ€™s weird news, glorious and salty hate mail, and apparently Jordan Peterson is Red Skull.
