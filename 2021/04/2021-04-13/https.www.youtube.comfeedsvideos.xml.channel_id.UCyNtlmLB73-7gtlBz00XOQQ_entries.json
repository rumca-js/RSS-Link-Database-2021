Channel Awesome CEO Mike Michaud severed the relationship after he received angry emails about an expos\u00e9 of 8chan I had published on Medium and I refused to take it down or commit to not doing \"anything else like that.\" Several of the songs are a roundabout veiled reference to #ChangeTheChannel, a hashtag that gained some traction in the spring of 2018 as contributors and former contributors to Channel Awesome spilled all the beans about CA's incompetence and mismanagement. What started as a bunch of people sharing stories about how the scheduling page never worked right escalated to Channel Awesome leadership releasing a counterattack letter in which they inadvertently admitted to covering for a sex predator.\n\nFantano (who I stole two lines from): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEbf8YhTWEo\nMs. Lola: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgGZmwGUIJ4\nJAR Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKmLEwyWDkw\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehuman\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman\n\n0:00 - The Wall\n7:37 - Doug\n19:13 - We Need More Victimization\n25:51 - So Long, Weird Song\n33:34 - Comfortably Dumb\n34:48 - It's not that vague, Doug\n38:44 - The Trial", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rokAtlFGa7Y", "date_published": "2021-04-13 17:09:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
