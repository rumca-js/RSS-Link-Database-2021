We saw a few games get delayed back in 2020, but it seems that the real impact of the pandemic on the gaming world is being felt in 2021. We're not even halfway through the year but numerous titles have slipped from their original release dates, with some even moving into 2022.

It's to be expected. Game development is hard enough without the pitfalls of transitioning to working from home. While it's a shame that games won't be released when we initially thought they would, we say give developers all the time they need to release something that they're truly proud of.

The above video lists a number of games that have been delayed in 2021, including Gotham Knights, Hogwarts Legacy, and Deathloop, among others. We'll just have to wait a little while longer to play them. But there's still plenty being released, for the latest recommendations, check out gamespot.com and youtube.com/gamespot.

## Resident Evil 7 Story Recap

It's been a few years since Resident Evil 7, so with Resident Evil Village is nearly here, let’s recap what went down in the Baker house all those years ago with Ethan and Mia Winters.

Check out our complete Resident Evil timeline explained here: https://youtu.be/QkPgowr-T9g

Resident Evil Village is nearly here, which means big spooky times with Lady Dimitrescu. However, it’s been a few years since Resident Evil 7, and while RE Village isn’t called 8, it’s something of a direct sequel, as it's the return of 7’s protagonist Ethan Winters. And not to forget series veteran Chris Redfield, who also had a guest appearance at the end of the last installment.

In this video, Kurt Indovina recaps the events of Resident Evil 7, from Ethan’s search for his wife Mia, to escaping the grips of the Baker family, and also, most strangely, its two endings--only one of which is canonical to Resident Evil Village.

Where Resident Evil 7 returned to its more traditional roots of survival horror, Village seems to be taking a lot of inspiration from one of the franchises most iconic installments: Resident Evil 4. Look no further than the addition of a merchant, tetris-like inventory management, and a European-style village to draw comparisons. Still, there are many questions left to be answered: like, what is the importance of Ethan and Mia’s child who has been taken? Why does Chris Redfield suddenly appear to be a villain? And how much alone time will Ethan get to have with Lady Dimitrescu? May 7 couldn’t come soon enough.
