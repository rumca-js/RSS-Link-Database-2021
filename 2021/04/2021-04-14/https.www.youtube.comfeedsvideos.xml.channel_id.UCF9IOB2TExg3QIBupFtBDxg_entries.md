Do we need to change vaccination protocols?

Thrombocytopenia has been consistently reported following the administration of adenoviral gene transfer vectors

Adenovirus-induced thrombocytopenia is a potentially serious complication of gene therapy protocols using this type of vector. 

Understanding its mechanism may help the development of measures to prevent this adverse event. 

In this report, we have studied platelet-adenovirus interactions in vitro and in vivo after intravenous administration of adenovirus to mice. 

We show that adenovirus induces platelet activation and promotes the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates both in vitro and in vivo.

Thrombocytopenia occurs between 5 and 24 hours following intravenous administration of adenovirus to mice

Adenovirus activates platelets and induces rapid exposure of P-selectin

Adenovirus activates endothelial cells

Incorrect injection technique

Vaccine technique can be a rare cause of clots

State Serum Institute of Denmark, now recommends injection aspiration before injecting vaccine

There is suspicion as to whether accidental injection of the vaccine into a blood vessel could play a role

Intravascular administration may lead to a systemic inflammatory reaction leading to blood clots

Danish nursing council

Covid-19 vaccines should be given with aspiration before injection

https://sqd34kucpgoufz3qiuiswlotka--dsr-dk.translate.goog/politik-og-nyheder/nyhed/covid-19-vacciner-skal-gives-med-aspiration-foer-injektion

Aspiration is recommended for all approved covid-19 vaccines

Consistent with the Danish Health and Medicines Authority's guidelines

Vaccination personnel should ensure that they are injected correctly into a muscle and not into the bloodstream

Possible connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare but serious side effects with blood clots and bleeding

When vaccinating, it is important to make sure that the vaccine does not go directly into the bloodstream. 

UK and WHO guidelines

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/147915/Green-Book-Chapter-4.pdf

Vaccines should not be given intravenously. 

It is not necessary to aspirate the syringe after the needle is introduced into the muscle (WHO, 2004; Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004).

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, together with low platelets

Some sort of immune response

6 cases from 6.8 million doses

Look out for, severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath within three weeks of vaccination

Paul A.Offit, vaccine specialist, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia

I think it’s the prudent thing to do 

I think it’s real — this is a rare, but real association

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), meets today

EMA also investigating, delaying European rollout

Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner, Food and Drug Administration

One reason for the pause, health professionals must know not to use heparin

All six cases in the US, occurred among women, 18 to 48

6 – 13 days after vaccination

Of the 6, 1 death and 1 critical

Of the 6, 2 discharged

The person in critical condition was (reportedly) treated with heparin

Peter Marks, director of the FDA's centre for biologics evaluation and research

hesitate to call it a class effect related to adenovirus vector vaccines

It's plainly obvious to us already that what we're seeing with the Jansen vaccines looks very similar to what is being seen with the AstraZeneca vaccine

AstraZeneca, chimpanzee adenoviral vector 

Janssen, human adenoviral vector vaccine

I can't make some broad statement yet, but obviously they are from the same general class of viral vectors

Scale of the problem

100 million doses to US end of May

can produce 1 billion doses globally by the end of the year

has agreed to sell 500 million doses to developing nations via Covax purchasing agreement

agreed to sell up to 400 million to African countries
