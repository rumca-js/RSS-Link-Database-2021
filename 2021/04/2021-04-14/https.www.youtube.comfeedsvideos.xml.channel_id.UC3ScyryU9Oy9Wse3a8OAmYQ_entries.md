"American Insurrection," a 90-minute documentary from FRONTLINE, ProPublica and Berkeley Journalism's Investigative Reporting Program, traces the road that led to the Capitol siege and examines the evolution of right-wing extremism over the past several years — including how fallout from Charlottesville prompted some groups to change their tactics, the mounting acts of political violence that preceded the Capitol attack, and the contours of the right-wing extremist movement today. 

"American Insurrection" premiered April 13, 2021, and is now available to stream in full: https://to.pbs.org/3d9Bzgk

The documentary is supported by Exploring Hate, a new, multiplatform public media initiative from The WNET Group in New York aimed at offering an in-depth understanding of the rising tide of hatred, hate crimes, anti-Semitism and racism.
