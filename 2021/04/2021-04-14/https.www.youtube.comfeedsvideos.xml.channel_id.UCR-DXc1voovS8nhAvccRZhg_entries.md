During this live stream, I'll attempt to get OctoPrint set up on a Raspberry Pi 4 so I can have more control over my Ender 3 V2 printer. I'll also be streaming directly over Starlink, through SpaceX's satellite constellation using Dishy on my roof!

Will the stream work? Will my 3D Printer start printing spaghetti? Who knows! Find out LIVE during this stream.
