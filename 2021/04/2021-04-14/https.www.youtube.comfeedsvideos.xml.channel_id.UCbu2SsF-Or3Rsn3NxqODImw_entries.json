We're not even halfway through the year but numerous titles have slipped from their original release dates, with some even moving into 2022.\n\nIt's to be expected. Game development is hard enough without the pitfalls of transitioning to working from home. While it's a shame that games won't be released when we initially thought they would, we say give developers all the time they need to release something that they're truly proud of.\n\nThe above video lists a number of games that have been delayed in 2021, including Gotham Knights, Hogwarts Legacy, and Deathloop, among others. We'll just have to wait a little while longer to play them.

However, it\u2019s been a few years since Resident Evil 7, and while RE Village isn\u2019t called 8, it\u2019s something of a direct sequel, as it's the return of 7\u2019s protagonist Ethan Winters. And not to forget series veteran Chris Redfield, who also had a guest appearance at the end of the last installment.\n\nIn this video, Kurt Indovina recaps the events of Resident Evil 7, from Ethan\u2019s search for his wife Mia, to escaping the grips of the Baker family, and also, most strangely, its two endings--only one of which is canonical to Resident Evil Village.\n\nWhere Resident Evil 7 returned to its more traditional roots of survival horror, Village seems to be taking a lot of inspiration from one of the franchises most iconic installments: Resident Evil 4. Look no further than the addition of a merchant, tetris-like inventory management, and a European-style village to draw comparisons. Still, there are many questions left to be answered: like, what is the importance of Ethan and Mia\u2019s child who has been taken? Why does Chris Redfield suddenly appear to be a villain? And how much alone time will Ethan get to have with Lady Dimitrescu? May 7 couldn\u2019t come soon enough.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_M_KFIzqa0", "date_published": "2021-04-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge - Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder\u2019s Revenge is bringing all the action to Nintendo Switch.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbxIAqSUHtI", "date_published": "2021-04-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
