Data up to April 21

Extremely low breakthrough infection rate

India data, 0.02% to 0.04% of vaccinated people falling ill

United States rates, 0.008 %

One dose of COVID-19 vaccine can cut household transmission by up to half

Being vaccinated significantly reduces risk of infection, hospitalisation, death

Reduced risk of developing symptomatic infection, 4 weeks after one dose of either vaccine, 60 to 65%

Those who do become infected 3 weeks after receiving one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine

Were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus on to their household contacts

Similar results expected, shared accommodations, prisons

Based on

57,000 contacts from 24,000 households

Compared with 1 million contacts of unvaccinated cases

Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock

comprehensive real-world data showing vaccines cut transmission

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE

even if you have been vaccinated, it is really important that you continue to act like you have the virus, practise good hand hygiene and follow social distancing guidance.

Israel, 5 million people fully vaccinated

62 recorded cases of myocarditis

Mostly after second dose

Most in men under 30

Now cases in US military

1 in 193,831

Developed after receiving either Pfizer or Moderna

One patient, tested positive for COVID-19 three months ago

Then developed myocarditis after first dose of vaccine

Remaining 13 patients developed myocarditis after their second vaccine doses

Moderna, 11 cases

Pfizer, 3 cases

All developed chest pain 12 to 96 hours after vaccination.

Steve Beynon, 30, developed myocarditis after second dose of Moderna

Hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in February

Nearly three days in the ICU

Has since performed his National Guard duties

Marcus Weisgerber, 39, developed myocarditis after his second Pfizer shot

Two days in the hospital

 https://vaers.hhs.gov

45 reports of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccines

Majority of cases occurred after the second dose

Pfizer, 19 cases reported after the Pfizer vaccine and 26 after the 

Moderna, 26 cases

62%, in men, mostly 20 to 45

Vigorous exercise after vaccination?

Vaccine choice, may be:

Younger women, better with Pfizer (due to very small risk of TTS with Janssen, as recommended by FDA)

Younger men, better with Janssen (due to possible links with myocarditis in younger men in Israel and US military)

J&J/Janssen Update

CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend use

Reports suggest an increased risk of a rare adverse event called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)

Nearly all reports, adult women younger than 50 years old

Potential benefits outweigh known and potential risks

Women younger than 50 years old should be aware

there are other COVID-19 vaccine options available

For three weeks after receiving the vaccine

lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets

Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision

Shortness of breath

Chest pain

Leg swelling

Persistent abdominal pain

Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the injection site

Channel 12 reported Friday

More than 5 million people vaccinated

62 recorded cases of myocarditis

56 of those cases came after the second shot

Most of the affected were men under 30.

60 of the patients were treated and released from hospital in good condition

2 deaths (22-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man)

details had also been sent to the US FDA and CDC, who were also investigating

one possible reason for lack of similar findings in other countries was the low rate of vaccinations among young people

There is specific concern regarding the frequency of the occurrence observed in men under 30 in the days immediately after the second shot

At this stage, according to initial findings that still need to be verified, there is an impression that the number (of cases) is higher than would be expected, especially for those under 30

Overall findings, 1-in-100,000

Aged 16 â€“ 30 years, 1-in-20,000

We cannot yet tell if there are more cases than normal or if there are similar numbers annually and the proximity is just a coincidence. 

Efforts to collect more data are continuing

Israel, children aged 12-15, when US Food and Drugs Administration approves

Health Ministry Director-General Chezy Levi

Once that age group has been vaccinated, the country will reach herd immunity

Therefore no need to vaccinate younger children

Vaccine choice, may be:

Younger women, Pfizer

Younger men, Janssen
