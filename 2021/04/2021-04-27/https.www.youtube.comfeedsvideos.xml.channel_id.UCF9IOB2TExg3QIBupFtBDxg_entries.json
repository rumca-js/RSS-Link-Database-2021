investigating\n\none possible reason for lack of similar findings in other countries was the low rate of vaccinations among young people\n\nThere is specific concern regarding the frequency of the occurrence observed in men under 30 in the days immediately after the second shot\n\nAt this stage, according to initial findings that still need to be verified, there is an impression that the number (of cases) is higher than would be expected, especially for those under 30\n\nOverall findings, 1-in-100,000\n\nAged 16 \u2013 30 years, 1-in-20,000\n\nWe cannot yet tell if there are more cases than
