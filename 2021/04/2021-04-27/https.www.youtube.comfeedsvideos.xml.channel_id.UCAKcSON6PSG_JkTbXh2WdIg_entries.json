This collective \u2014 comprising MMYYKK, Greg Grease, DJ Just Nine and Art Parte \u2014 are known for their innovative and authentic m\u00e9lange of funk, soul, jazz, hip hop and Afrobeat. \n\nWatch two performances by Astralblak recorded during a visit to The Current studio in 2016. At the time, the band operated under the name ZULUZULUU, but they changed the name to Astralblak in 2018. \"The main reason for the name change was a matter of authenticity and accountability,\" the band explained in a statement. \"Being that none of us is directly related to the actual Zulu tribe of South Africa, we collectively decided that changing the name would be the most respectful course of action. Astralblak is universal as in connecting with the universe, it is all encompassing in its narrative of blackness and highlights the diversity in all of our individual experiences as artists and members of the unified diaspora.\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"On Our Way\" \n3:40 \"What's The Price\"\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Andrea Swensson\n\nFIND MORE:\n2016 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/09/12/zuluzuluu-perform-in-the-currents-studios\n2018 name change news story: https://blog.thecurrent.org/2018/02/zuluzuluu-change-name-to-astralblak-as-the-most-respectful-course-of-action/\n2019 news story about Walker space:\nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2019/08/astralblak-to-bring-signature-space-vibe-to-walker-art-center-sound-for-silents/\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#astralblak", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jGvJyZ4niA", "date_published": "2021-04-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Listen to Looch - \"L7: Pretend We're Dead\" documentary rocks", "description": "Mary Lucia talks about \"Pretend We're Dead,\" a documentary about the Los Angeles rock and roll band, L7. \"They were four hard-working, hard-rocking women,\" Mary says. \"On the road all the time, they wrote great songs, were well admired by their peers, but just never really busted through that next level.\n\n\"They were also very outspoken feminists and had started up the whole Rock For Choice, which was major,\" Mary continues. \"They're an incredibly cool group of women, that, like I said, just kind of got a little lost in that shuffle of, 'we don't know quite where to put you,' but I put them in the category of kickass.\"\n\nWatch all of what Mary Lucia has to say about \"L7: Pretend We're Dead.\" The documentary is directed by Sarah Price, and is available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video and other platforms.\n\nFIND MORE:\nL7's 2018 session in The Current studio:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/04/19/l7-rock-the-rafters-at-the-current\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#l7 #l7band #marylucia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCmf6mag7k", "date_published": "2021-04-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Kara Laudon - two songs at The Current (2019)", "description": "For Minnesota Music Month, we're spotlighting Minnesota musicians, and today, we're featuring this two-song set from Kara Laudon, recorded in The Current studio in 2019.\n\nTwin Cities-based singer-songwriter Kara Laudon released the album \"Old Lives\" on September 27, 2019; it was produced by John Mark Nelson.
