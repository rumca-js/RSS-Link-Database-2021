Astralblak are our Minnesota Music Month featured artists for Tuesday, April 27. This collective — comprising MMYYKK, Greg Grease, DJ Just Nine and Art Parte — are known for their innovative and authentic mélange of funk, soul, jazz, hip hop and Afrobeat. 

Watch two performances by Astralblak recorded during a visit to The Current studio in 2016. At the time, the band operated under the name ZULUZULUU, but they changed the name to Astralblak in 2018. "The main reason for the name change was a matter of authenticity and accountability," the band explained in a statement. "Being that none of us is directly related to the actual Zulu tribe of South Africa, we collectively decided that changing the name would be the most respectful course of action. Astralblak is universal as in connecting with the universe, it is all encompassing in its narrative of blackness and highlights the diversity in all of our individual experiences as artists and members of the unified diaspora."

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "On Our Way"

Mary Lucia talks about "Pretend We're Dead," a documentary about the Los Angeles rock and roll band, L7. "They were four hard-working, hard-rocking women," Mary says. "On the road all the time, they wrote great songs, were well admired by their peers, but just never really busted through that next level.

"They were also very outspoken feminists and had started up the whole Rock For Choice, which was major," Mary continues. "They're an incredibly cool group of women, that, like I said, just kind of got a little lost in that shuffle of, 'we don't know quite where to put you,' but I put them in the category of kickass."

Watch all of what Mary Lucia has to say about "L7: Pretend We're Dead." The documentary is directed by Sarah Price, and is available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video and other platforms.
