Resident Evil Village looks like a combination of Resident Evil 7 and the more action-oriented Resident Evil 4. The village portion of the game has heavy Resident Evil 4 vibes, with Ethan fighting through hordes of werewolf-like creatures. In the castle, though, Ethan will have to deal with the vampiric Lady Dimitrescu and her daughters. The castle looks like a big change of pace from the more action-heavy village are, as you'll primarily be avoiding Lady Dimitrescu and her daughters, rather than fighting them. Resident Evil Village's next demo, which drops at 5 PM PDT Saturday, April 24, will allow you to explore the Castle for 30 minutes on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNsufTHEra4", "date_published": "2021-04-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Zelda BOTW Pro Speedrunner and Combat Expert React to New Viral Clips", "description": "We gathered Breath of the Wild pro speedrunner Limcube and combat expert RinHara5aki together to break down some speedruns, combat, glitches, and more.\n\nBreath of the Wild is the game that keeps on giving, with people still finding new things four years later.
