But we\u2019re changing Earth in ways that threaten to disrupt and even break critical ocean currents like the planet-wide Great Ocean Conveyor. This could have devastating effects on our future. In this video, we explain how ocean currents work, how climate change is threatening to disrupt them, and what we can do to stop that from happening.\n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/ocean-conveyor-belt/home \n\n-----------\n\nBig Thank you to our Brain Trust Patrons:\n\nAndrew Campbell \nRobert\nBrian Chang\nRoy Lasris\nJavier Soto\ndani bowman\nDavid Johnston\nZenimal\nSalih Arslan\nBaerbel Winkler\nRobert Young\nAmy Sowada\nBenjamin Teinby\nEric Meer\nPeter Ehrnstrom\nDustin\nMarcus Tuepker\nKaren Haskell\nAlecZero\n\n\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2evaLaDvCI", "date_published": "2021-04-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
