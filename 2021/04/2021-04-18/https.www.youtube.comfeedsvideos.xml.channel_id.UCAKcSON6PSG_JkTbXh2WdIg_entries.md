Back in April 2011, jeremy messersmith hosted Works for Words, an event at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minn., where messersmith welcomed a group of friends — including Chris Koza — for a night of the best lyrical works in song. From that night 10 years ago at the Fitz, here's a performance by Chris Koza of his band Rogue Valley's song, "The Blackberry Moon," from their 2010 album, "The Bookseller's House."
