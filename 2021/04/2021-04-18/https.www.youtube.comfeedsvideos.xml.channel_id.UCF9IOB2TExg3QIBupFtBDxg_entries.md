Janssen pause lifting Friday 23rd April

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/18/pause-johnson-johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-likely-be-lifted-by-friday-fauci-says/

Dr. Fauci

By Friday, we should have an answer as to where we’re going with it

I would think that we’re not going to go beyond Friday in the extension of this pause

I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment

I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.’

The six cases of the blood clots were in women ages 18 and 48

Late summer or early fall (Dr. Fauci)

FDA and the CDC will probably decide on a third booster shot

Expects high school students will be vaccinated by the fall school term

Elementary schoolchildren will receive vaccine doses by the first quarter of 2022.

Now

Just over half of all adults in the US, at least one dose

131 million people

Sunday, 84 million, fully vaccinated

Anyone aged over 18 is now eligible

Dr. Fauci

US remains in a precarious position

US cases going up

90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated, mainly with mRNA vaccines including Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, 

without any safety concerns being raised.

Preferable for pregnant women in the UK to be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines where available. 

There is no evidence to suggest that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women, but more research is needed.

still advises that pregnant women should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their clinician

Brazil

Vinicius 
Speaking from Brazil here. The situation is absolutely out of control. There are thousands of people dying without even get the chance to be treated. We need help, our goverment simply doesn't do anything about it. I personally know more then 15 people that died from COVID.

Deaths, 371,889

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-56696907

Deaths in under 9s, 852

Including 518 under I year

0.58% of Brazil's 345,287 Covid deaths to date have been of 0-9 year olds

More than 2,000 children

Not all from MIS

Up to 6 weeks after acute infection

Dr Fatima Marinho from the University of São Paolo

Childhood deaths underreported

10 times more deaths by unexplained respiratory syndrome than in previous years

Actual deaths, 2,060 children under nine years old, including 1,302 babies

Factors

High case numbers

Limited testing in children

Poverty and access to care

Crowded poor accommodation

Background malnutrition

Late diagnosis and care

Currently no vaccination under 16 years

Differential presentation

A child has a lot more diarrhoea, a lot more abdominal pain, and chest pain, than the classic Covid picture. 

Because there is a delay in diagnosis, when the child arrives at the hospital they are in a serious condition and can end up complicating - and dying

Chile, vaccination contradiction?

But

 Factors

Pandemic fatigue

Summer vacation travel

New variants

Chinese vaccine

Leonila Ferreira, ITU, Concepción

Patients younger on average than during the first wave

Continuing to let people travel abroad was a grave error

It introduced new variants which Chile has been slow to detect and contain

87% Sinovac’s CoronaVac data

60 million doses contracted over 3 years

(also some Pfizer)

10.5 million people followed, Feb. 2 to April 1

of whom 1.5 million first dose

2.5 million second dose

Two weeks after second dose

(28 days between primary and booster doses)

Symptomatic disease reduced by 67%

Deaths reduced by 80%

Hospitalizations reduced by 85%

ICU admission by reduced by 89%

Much lower after only one dose

Hospitals still stretched

Thinking about a third dose

Santiago locked down again

Now

First dose, 40%

Second dose, 27%

Down to 48 year olds

Sharp decrease in over 70 hospitalizations

Sustained rise in under 59s
