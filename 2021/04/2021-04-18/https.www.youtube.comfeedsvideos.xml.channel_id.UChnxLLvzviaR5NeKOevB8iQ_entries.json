Those were recorded and then chopped up and placed into an Ableton Sampler instrument with settings to make aggressive chaos easy and fun.\n\nTo install BAD WOLF open the demo project and hit the little save icon for each rack. This will save the rack to your User Library and copy the samples to your User Library Samples folder for Ableton.\n\nBAD WOLF, as a Live instrument, is only compatible with Live 11 Suite.\nThe BAD WOLF samples are compatible with any DAW.\n\nUsing BAD WOLF is easy. Drag a rack in, draw some notes, and play around.\n\nTranspose: changes the pitch\nSound Cycler: randomly cycles through the sample for that instance, on each note\nStart LFO: chooses a random start LFO for the current sample, on each note\nOTT: makes big bright\nFiltro: moving notch filter\nReverse: reverses all samples, creating new sounds\nSound Selector: picks a specific sound. If the sound cycler is on, this should be fully left\nExtra: f*ck around and find out\n\nWE HOPE YOU ENJOY BAD WOLF\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching.
