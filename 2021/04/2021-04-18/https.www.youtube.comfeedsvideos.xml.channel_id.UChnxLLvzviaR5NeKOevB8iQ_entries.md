BAD WOLF is a sample pack and collection of Ableton instruments geared towards hyper-aggressive bass and effects. 

It was created with single bass, chord, and effect samples fed into a granular processor (STRIGHT for M4L) with a ton of modulation and effects. Those were recorded and then chopped up and placed into an Ableton Sampler instrument with settings to make aggressive chaos easy and fun.

To install BAD WOLF open the demo project and hit the little save icon for each rack. This will save the rack to your User Library and copy the samples to your User Library Samples folder for Ableton.

BAD WOLF, as a Live instrument, is only compatible with Live 11 Suite.
The BAD WOLF samples are compatible with any DAW.

Using BAD WOLF is easy. Drag a rack in, draw some notes, and play around.

Transpose: changes the pitch
Sound Cycler: randomly cycles through the sample for that instance, on each note
Start LFO: chooses a random start LFO for the current sample, on each note
OTT: makes big bright
Filtro: moving notch filter
Reverse: reverses all samples, creating new sounds
Sound Selector: picks a specific sound. If the sound cycler is on, this should be fully left
Extra: f*ck around and find out

WE HOPE YOU ENJOY BAD WOLF
