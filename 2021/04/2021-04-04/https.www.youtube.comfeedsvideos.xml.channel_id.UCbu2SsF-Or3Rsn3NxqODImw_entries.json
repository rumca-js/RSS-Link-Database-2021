Capture cards, microphones, lights, and now acoustic paneling of all things. You know, the stuff you attach to your wall to improve the sound quality of your room.\n\nThese are the Elgato Wave panels, not to be mixed up with the Wave, which confusingly is also the name of their brand of microphones. For $100 USD you get the starter pack of 6 wave panels, a not insignificant amount of money to be spending, especially when you can buy generic acoustic foam much cheaper. Elgato sent us a pack to try out so in this video we\u2019re gonna breakdown what you\u2019re getting for that added price, how the setup works, and if these actually make enough of a difference in acoustics to be worth buying.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoYP_Lwil84", "date_published": "2021-04-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Best Games On Xbox Game Pass", "description": "If you've picked up a subscription to Xbox Game Pass but are feeling overwhelmed by choice, here's a quick selection of the best games on the service at the moment that might have passed you by. \nWe say it almost every week on Console Crew, but Xbox Game Pass is one of the best deals in gaming, providing a rotating catalogue of day-one releases, indies, old favorites, and those games you always meant to play but never found the time to. \n\nIt can be overwhelming to log in and see all those games just ready for you to play, so where do you start?
