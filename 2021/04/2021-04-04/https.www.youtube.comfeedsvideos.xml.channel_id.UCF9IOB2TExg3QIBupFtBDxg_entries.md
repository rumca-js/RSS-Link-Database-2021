Individual present-centeredness is mirrored in the larger society

Morbidity may be responsible for as much as 40% of the health costs of COVID-19

Corresponding economic loss—estimated as high as $16 trillion in the US

90% of the gross domestic product

This indicates potential savings in preparing for the next pandemic

1918 populations
