Last year, the festival was canceled due to the pandemic, but it returned this March as an online festival. We programmed a 'stage' of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and presented them on the final day of the festival. Now, we present to you Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: four videos filmed in various locations, all of them full of surprises.\n\nBob Boilen | April 5, 2021\nWe've posted close to 200 Tiny Desk (home) concerts in this insane pandemic year. Few have made me smile and laugh out loud as much as this one from\u00a0Steady Holiday. I'll stop with the spoilers now.\n\nSteady Holiday is the music of Dre Babinski. This video, filmed for our virtual SXSW showcase, finds her by the fireplace, a dog at her feet, an acoustic guitar in her arms. Steady Holiday is singing \"Living Life,\" a tune about a favorite topic of mine: the everyday, the mundane, and living in the moment. All the songs in this Tiny Desk (home) concert are from Steady Holiday's 2021 album\u00a0Take The Corners Gently,\u00a0a top album of mine this year. Laughing while her dog grabs a chew toy, she performs the album's opening track, \"White Walls,\", a song about self-reflection and how doing the same thing over and over (\"painting white walls white\") won't make life better.\n\nAs her printer cues the last song, (oops, small spoiler), Steady Holiday takes us out on a lovely tune,\u00a0\"Love Me When I Go To Sleep\": \"Fragile aren't we, who would guess / Here today, tomorrow's taking bets.\" Her refrain amplifies that fragility with a reminder to appreciate the gift of life. \"Love me when I go to sleep / Love me with no certainty / Love me when I go to sleep.\"\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Living Life\"\n \u2022 \"Tangerine\"\n \u2022 \"White Walls\"\n \u2022 \"Love Me When I Go To Sleep\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Dre Babinski: vocals, guitar\n \u2022 Derek Howa: keys\n \u2022 Brijesh Pandya: drums, vocals\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Isaac Ravishankara, Drew Bienemann, Derek Hansen, Zack Hetlage\n \u2022 Audio: Chris Hackman, Dave Pizzimenti\n \u2022 Color: Derek Hansen, Zack Hetlage\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Bob Boilen\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #steadyholiday", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNy-HJXcFho", "date_published": "2021-04-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
