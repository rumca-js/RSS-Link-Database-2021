UK, 12th April, Next stage in roadmap

Prof Graham Medley, Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies

Eventual indoor, highly likely resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths

It really just depends upon the impact of vaccination, particularly on transmission, so whether or not people can get infected and pass the virus on. 

And we just don't know that

The only thing we can be sure of is that we don't know exactly what is going to happen

but we do know that, because the vaccine isn't 100% effective, there will be some transmission, 

and there will be some breakthrough of immunity."
