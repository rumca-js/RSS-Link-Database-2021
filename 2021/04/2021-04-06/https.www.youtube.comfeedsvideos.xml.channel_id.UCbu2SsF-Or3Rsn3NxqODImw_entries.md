The infamous AK-47 is a fan-favorite assault rifle. Let's take a look back at its appearances throughout Call of Duty's history. 

00:00 - Intro
00:14 - COD4: Modern Warfare
00:44 - Modern Warfare 2
01:15 - Black Ops 1
02:02 - Modern Warfare 3 
02:40 - Black Ops 2 
03:09 - Black Ops 2 Zombies
03:34 - Advanced Warfare 
04:12 - Modern Warfare Remastered 
04:42 - Call of Duty Mobile

The AK-47 is one of Call of Duty’s most revered assault rifles. In and out of the series, the gun represents all things villainous and badass. The assault rifle has been featured in several of main series’ entries including the entire Modern Warfare saga. In later games however we see less of it within the Black Ops’ futuristic titles. Its return to Modern Warfare 2019 and Cold War were no surprise because love it or hate it, the AK47 is legendary.

Despite being produced in the late 40s, we didn’t see much of the AK in early Call of Duty games like 1, 2, and 3. It wasn’t until the WWII craze ended that we saw the Russian rifle popularized in video games. Beginning with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, most enemy forces in the modern-day setting are equipped with AK, while domestic forces like the Army Rangers always carried the M4 or M-16A4. This (and the entire 1980s) popularized the rifle as the ultimate “bad guy” weapon.

In futuristic titles like Black Ops 3, we hear less and less from the AK-47. Instead, most of these titles feature the AN-94 or KN-44 platform series. Over the years, the AK has also been featured in the popular Black Ops Zombies mode. When pack-a-punched for extra firepower, the AK is called “Reznov’s Revenge”- an homage to World at War and Black Ops 1’s Victor Reznov.

With the official confirmation from The ESA that E3 2021 will be a free online digital event, Lucy, Tamoor, and Jordan discuss the future of the gaming show and what to expect this summer. 

It's official: E3 2021 is happening and it's going to be a free online event for everyone to enjoy. The ESA has released a list of the publishers that will be taking part, and it makes for an interesting read.

With so many publishers having their own digital events and showcases, do publishers even need E3? This sounds like a question for the Console Crew! Tamoor, Jordan, and Lucy got together to discuss the news in this week's episode. In particular, they talk about Sony's absence and Xbox's inclusion in the huge summer event. They also discuss the future of E3 and the show's hopes of being an in-person event in 2022.
