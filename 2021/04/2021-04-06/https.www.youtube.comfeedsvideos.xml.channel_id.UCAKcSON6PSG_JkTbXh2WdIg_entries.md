This week, Mary Lucia discusses "Tina," the documentary about Tina Turner that just debuted on HBO. "It is what I would believe Tina Turner hopes to be the punctuation at the end of a very long, brutal, traumatic story," Mary says.

"I don't think Turner tries to pretend that she's come out the other side all shiny and happy," Mary contineus. "She truly expresses that this was her hand dealt in life, and she is dealing with it the best way she knows how. There's something very tender and heartbreaking about all of this, even though it's the story of survival; of certainly of a revered career.

"Tina Turner always wanted to be on the level of the Rolling Stones or anybody else that could fill a stadium — and she did it. This film contains great footage, and there's some real honesty in what Tina Turner says about her life and how she views it."

See more of what Mary Lucia has to say about "Tina" in the video above. "Tina" is co-directed by Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin, and it's streaming now on HBO.
