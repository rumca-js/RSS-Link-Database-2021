We're continuing to spotlight Minnesota musicians during Minnesota Music Month, and today, we're featuring this full session, recorded in The Current studio in 2017, with Now, Now.

Now, Now formed in Blaine, Minn., around 2003; initially called "Now, Now Every Children," the band shortened the name in 2010. Back in 2012, Now, Now released their second album, "Threads," and its success blew the band away. "We were expecting for it to do the same thing as any of our other EPs," KC Dalager told Andrea Swensson on The Local Show. But along with band members Brad Hale and Jess Abbott, Dalager got written up in national publications; toured with fun., whose song "We Are Young" was just about to explode; and grew a fanbase few local bands can boast. However, Now, Now learned about overexertion the hard way. As they continued to say "yes" to every opportunity, they got more and more burned out.

Five years later, Abbott parted ways with Now, Now to work on her project Tancred, but Hale and Dalager returned with new music: "SGL," a punchy pop/rock single. Watch Now, Now's 2017 performance of that song, plus two songs from their 2012 release, "Threads."

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "SGL"
3:24 "Lucie, Too"
7:10 "Prehistoric"

KC Dalager – vocals, keys, guitar

## Dessa - three from "Making of 'Sound the Bells' " (2019)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brfbTJjASUA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brfbTJjASUA)

Dessa is our Minnesota Music Month artist of the day for Wednesday, April 8. 

In March of 2019, Dessa and the Grammy-winning Minnesota Orchestra joined forces to record "Sound the Bells." They sold out two nights at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, wired it with microphones, and put on an epic show full of rap bangers, infectious pop songs, tragic ballads, costume changes, and a little Bach. But how do hip-hop tracks get transformed into compositions that can be played by more than 75 classical musicians? (Spoiler: it involves arranger extraordinaire Andy Thompson and more than a thousand pages of scores.) Is it true that conductor Sarah Hicks uses a baton molded specially for her hand? (IT IS.)

The Making of Sound the Bells pulls back the curtain to explore the workings of this ambitious project through stories, images, and live performance from a string quartet composed of Minnesota Orchestra players.

Watch these live performances featuring a string quartet, Dessa, and four vocalists.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Good Grief"
5:02 "Fighting Fish"
8:10 "Dixon's Girl"
