Last year, the festival was canceled due to the pandemic, but it returned this March as an online festival. We programmed a 'stage' of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and presented them on the final day of the festival. Now, we present to you Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: four videos filmed in various locations, all of them full of surprises.\n\nStephen Thompson | April 8, 2021\nLeave it to\u00a0clipping.\u00a0to innovate around the central notion of the Tiny Desk; to take the series' emphasis on close-up intimacy and transport it to new heights of, well, tininess.\nThis is, after all, a band that contains multitudes. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes craft a bed of hip-hop, industrial music and noisy experimentalism, then set loose rapper Daveed Diggs, whose violent imagery summons '90s horrorcore and a thousand bloody movies. The band's last two album titles \u2014\u00a0There Existed an Addiction to Blood\u00a0and\u00a0Visions of Bodies Being Burned\u00a0\u2014 offer up a sense of the vibe, but Diggs' gift for rapid-fire wordplay also acts as a leavening agent. The guy\u00a0won a Tony Award for playing Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette in\u00a0Hamilton, and he still knows how to sell every word that leaves his lips.\n\nSo, yeah, multitudes. Plus, in this video, a few surprises to trick your eye and help pull you into a clever and disorienting world of sound.\n\nSET LIST\n \u25aa \"Something Underneath\"\n \u25aa \"Bout That\"\n \u25aa \"Check the Lock\"\n \u25aa \"Shooter\"\n \u25aa \"The Show\"\n \u25aa \"Nothing Is Safe\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u25aa Daveed Diggs: vocals\n \u25aa William Hutson: beats, effects\n \u25aa Jonathan Snipes: beats, effects\n \u25aa Chukwudi Hodge: drums\n\nCREDITS\n \u25aa Video: Cristina Bercovitz, Erin Bates, Daveed Diggs\n \u25aa Audio: clipping.\n \u25aa Tiny furniture fabricated by: Cristina Bercovitz\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u25aa Producer: Bob Boilen\n \u25aa Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u25aa Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u25aa Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u25aa Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame\n \u25aa Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n \u25aa Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #clipping", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn6S9NTpPvk", "date_published": "2021-04-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
