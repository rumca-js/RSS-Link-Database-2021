This is the first of a series of videos where I'll be exploring Starlink, SpaceX's new satellite-based Internet service.

I received a 'Dishy' in March, and in this first video, I take it to my cousin's farm and learn about how people living in more rural communities deal with Internet access. Then I unbox the dish and set it up using the Starlink App.
