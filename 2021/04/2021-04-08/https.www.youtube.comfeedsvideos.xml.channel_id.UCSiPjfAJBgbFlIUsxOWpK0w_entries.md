LYRICS
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With Somebody who loves me

I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun

I've done alright up til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
(girls, they wanna)
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
(wanna have fun)
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
(girls, they wanna have fun)
With somebody who loves me
(With somebody who loves me)

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

(girls, they wanna)
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
(wanna have fun)
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
(girls, wanna have fun)
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
(they wanna, wanna have fun)
With somebody who loves me

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just want

(Somebody who, somebody who)
Somebody who loves me
(Somebody who, somebody who)
To hold me in his arms

â€˜Cause I want to be the one to walk in the sun
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

(girls, they wanna)
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
(wanna have fun)
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
(girls, they wanna have fun)
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
(wanna have fun)
With somebody who loves me

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

They just wanna
They just wanna
(Girls, girls just wanna have fun)
They just wanna
They just wanna
Oh, girls, girls just wanna have fun
(Just wanna, they just wanna)
Oh, girls just wanna have fun
