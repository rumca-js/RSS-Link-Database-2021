Then I unbox the dish and set it up using the Starlink App.\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\n\nFind out more about Starlink: https://www.starlink.com\n\nWatch Ken Keiter's Starlink Dishy Teardown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOmdQnIlnRo\n\nSpecial thanks to Annie from Haarmann Farms for welcoming me to her home! http://haarmannfarms.com\n\n#SpaceX #Starlink #Dishy\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:38 - What is Starlink?\n03:23 - Thousands of satellites\n04:19 - Jeff goes rural\n06:46 - Unboxing Dishy\n09:00 - Plugging it all in\n10:29 - Starlink App setup\n12:31 - Will it work?\n12:59 - Maybe.\n13:43 - OSHA violations and bloopers\n\nRecord scratch sound effect by luffy, freesound.org\nRV video by Frederik M from Pexels\nBoat video by Kelly Lacy from Pexels\nRemote facility video by Sorapop Udomsri from Pexels\nDrone overlay from https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/camera-overlays-for-free/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VfAFj4jYw", "date_published": "2021-04-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
