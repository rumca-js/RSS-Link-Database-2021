Back in 2012, Now, Now released their second album, \"Threads,\" and its success blew the band away. \"We were expecting for it to do the same thing as any of our other EPs,\" KC Dalager told Andrea Swensson on The Local Show. But along with band members Brad Hale and Jess Abbott, Dalager got written up in national publications; toured with fun., whose song \"We Are Young\" was just about to explode; and grew a fanbase few local bands can boast. However, Now, Now learned about overexertion the hard way. As they continued to say \"yes\" to every opportunity, they got more and more burned out.\n\nFive years later, Abbott parted ways with Now, Now to work on her project Tancred, but Hale and Dalager returned with new music: \"SGL,\" a punchy pop/rock single. Watch Now, Now's 2017 performance of that song, plus two songs from their 2012 release, \"Threads.\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"SGL\"\n3:24 \"Lucie, Too\"\n7:10 \"Prehistoric\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nKC Dalager \u2013 vocals, keys, guitar\nBrad Hale \u2013 drums, beats\nDanny O'Brien \u2013 guitar\nJef Sundquist \u2013 bass\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Eric Romani\nProduction: Andrea Swensson\n\nFIND MORE:\n2012 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/02/14/nownow-live\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/07/17/now-now-perform-in-the-current-studios\n2018 MPR booth at the State Fair session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/09/02/watch-now-now-perform-at-the-minnesota-state-fair\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#nownow #nownowband #nownowmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvAIg4pCnw8", "date_published": "2021-04-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Dessa - three from \"Making of 'Sound the Bells' \" (2019)", "description": "Dessa is our Minnesota Music Month artist of the day for Wednesday, April 8. \n\nIn March of 2019, Dessa and the Grammy-winning Minnesota Orchestra joined forces to record \"Sound the Bells.\" They sold out two nights at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, wired it with microphones, and put on an epic show full of rap bangers, infectious pop songs, tragic ballads, costume changes, and a little Bach. But how do hip-hop tracks get transformed into compositions that can be played by more than 75 classical musicians? (Spoiler: it involves arranger extraordinaire Andy Thompson and more than a thousand pages of scores.) Is it true that conductor Sarah Hicks uses a baton molded specially for her hand? (IT IS.)\n\nThe Making of Sound the Bells pulls back the curtain to explore the workings of this ambitious project through stories, images, and live performance from a string quartet composed of Minnesota Orchestra players.\n\nWatch these live performances featuring a string quartet, Dessa, and four vocalists.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Good Grief\"\n5:02 \"Fighting Fish\"\n8:10 \"Dixon's Girl\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nDessa\nLazerbeak: Doomtree producer/album executive producer\nAndy Thompson: Arranger/album executive producer\nSarah Hicks: Live at Orchestra Hall Conductor\nSarah Grimes: violin\nBen Odhner: violin\nSam Bergman: viola\nPitnarry Shin: cello\nAby Wolf: Vocal Director/singer\nAshley Dubose: singer\nMatthew Santos: singer\nCameron Kinghorn: singer\n\nCREDITS\nAudio: Veronica Rodriguez, Cameron Wiley\nVideo: Mary Mathis, Nate Ryan\nEvent Production: Andrea Swensson, Ali Lozoff, Natalie Roman, Casey Collins\n\nFIND MORE:\n2011 Fitzgerald Theater concert: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/11/08/dessa-live-fitz\n2013 Fitzgerald Theater concert: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/07/10/dessa-fitzgerald-theater-performance-broadcast\n2018 MPR Forum session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/02/21/dessa-the-making-of-chime\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#dessa #soundthebells #mnorchestra", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brfbTJjASUA", "date_published": "2021-04-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Valerie June - Virtual Session", "description": "Valerie June connects with The Current's Mary Lucia to play a few songs from her latest record, 'The Moon and Stars: Prescriptions for Dreamers', plus an older favorite.
