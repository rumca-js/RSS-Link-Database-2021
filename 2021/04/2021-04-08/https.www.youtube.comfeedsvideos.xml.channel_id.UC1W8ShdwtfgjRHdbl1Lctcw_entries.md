I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of California 1950s, we get three journeys down San Fernando Road in Los Angeles between Pierce St. and Sunburst St. we can clearly see what is happening in broad daylight,

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
