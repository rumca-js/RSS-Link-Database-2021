The long fabled AirTag (yeah, it isn\u2019t plural) have been released and the new Find My update in iOS 14.5 is part of Apple\u2019s grand plan to become the de-facto device tracking network. We got a new iPhone 12 in a cute purple color (aww), and we finally got a new Apple TV 4K 6th generation with a redesigned Siri Remote (GOODNESS, GRACIOUS IT WAS ABOUT TIME, EH!?). A long rumored iMac design finally came to fruition with an M1 chip and external power supply (yeah, the design is weird and we talk about that), and then we have the most powerful iPad Pro ever made that exceeds the display performance of any device Apple has ever made. And that\u2019s where things get sus. Apple isn\u2019t telling us something very important about the future of iPad and I theorize what this might be. This isn\u2019t a summary video\u2014it\u2019s an analysis. So kick back and enjoy the ride.\n\nThumbnail by Richard Waterworth - https://YouTube.com/richardtech", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GlbxfquG-U", "date_published": "2021-04-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
