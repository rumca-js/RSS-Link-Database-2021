Yet hardly any of us knows how it works, how the idea of money has changed over time and how we\u2019re on the precipice of the next evolution of money. An evolution that\u2019s either going to be really dystopian, or one that might set us free. And the main player fighting for a more dystopian financial future? China.\n\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, China invented the next evolution of money. Traders started leaving those strings of coins behind to a trustworthy agent. That trustworthy agent would then record how much money the trader deposited on a piece of paper, the trader would hang on to that piece of paper, to use in place of physical coins. That piece of paper would be known as receipt money. And today, that trustworthy agent can be not-so-trustworthy - and goes by the name of a banker.\n\nToday - it\u2019s also China who\u2019s pushing for the next evolution of money.\n\nAlibaba and Jack Ma launch Alipay, a mobile wallet app that lets users pay for almost anything with a QR code on their phone. Bitcoin is invented. China paid attention. WeChat, China\u2019s messaging app that is used for almost everything, launched its own mobile wallet, WeChat Pay\n\nFacebook announces that it\u2019s going to launch its own cryptocurrency, Libra, that it\u2019s 2 billion users at the time could use to transact on the platform. While the US focused their efforts on stopping Facebook\u2019s power grab - China accelerated their\u2019s.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government does have ultimate control over these tech giants and they have to send their data to the gov, it\u2019s still a black box, the data is still delayed, the data is still in the hands of powerful people that the gov might not be able to trust, and these tech giants were starting to take over many functions of the traditional banking system and even the gov.\n\nSince the start of the initial Digital Yuan trials, more than 100,000 people have downloaded the government\u2019s mobile app. Basically, China took all the good stuff about cryptocurrencies. \n\n-----------------------\n\nNo Spirit - Slightly Improvised https://chll.to/6347930b \n\nThanks to Mine for sponsoring the video. \n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
