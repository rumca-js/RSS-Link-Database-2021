<h2 id="the-biggest-problem-with-cryptocurrency">The Biggest Problem with Cryptocurrency</h2>
<p>Most normal people hear the word &quot;cryptocurrency&quot; and assume that
means that they are &quot;cryptic&quot; or &quot;private,&quot; but that's actually a
huge, perhaps the hugest misunderstanding of our time and it has some
big consequences. The &quot;crypto&quot; in <em>cryptocurrency</em> merely comes
from its cryptographic nature.</p>
<p>When it comes to actual privacy, cryptocurrencies are an unmitigated
disaster: All transactions and wallet balances are easily viewable on
the necessarily public blockchain.</p>
<p>This might not <em>seem</em> like a problem to some, and there are also some
who will retort with &quot;Well, I'm not doing anything illegal so it
doesn't matter to me.&quot;</p>
<p>But here's the thing: <strong>Every currency in human history has been
totally private, so we have no other similar disaster scenario to even
compare this to.</strong></p>
<p>American dollars are centrally financially controled, but we can
transact without that being public information. Even when using a Visa
or Mastercard with your bank, Visa or your bank might know of the
transaction, but it <em>isn't</em> broadcast publicly to the entire world like
Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin is therefore a unique privacy disaster that we can't even
anticipate.</strong> No cryptocurrency is widely used enough as an actual
currency for people to really feel the burn of this, but this opens up
huge liabilities for every human on the planet. You might think the
American dollar is a NWO/Satanic/Mark-of-the-Beast currency that will
take away your freedoms, but let me tell you that Bitcoin as it is <em>is
far worse!</em></p>
<h3 id="the-disaster-of-the-bitcoin-future">The Disaster of the Bitcoin Future</h3>
<p>Here's some of the things we can expect in a world running on Bitcoin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your personal budget, income and bank account is necessarily public
information.</li>
<li>Every business's expenditures and payroll are now necessarily
public information. Everyone in the world knows how much everyone
makes and know what suppliers each business transacts with. Trade
secrets are a thing of the past. Employee privacy is a thing of the
past.</li>
<li>Consumer privacy is a thing of the past. Everyone knows how much
money everyone spends everywhere else.</li>
<li>Even giving money to friends for favors or help is visible to the
IRS. This makes easy micromanagement and taxation of even minor
things that might not be plausibly taxable now.</li>
<li>Nearly every privacy law is rendered unenforceable and useless by
Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<p>No sane person would volunteer to reveal all their bank accounts,
transaction histories, spending habits and thereby physical movements
for no reason to every government and business in the world. But if you
use most cryptocurrencies, that is exactly what you're doing.</p>
<h3 id="it-will-be-even-worse">It will be even worse.</h3>
<p>Losing personal privacy is one thing. Maybe you don't even mind a world
where eveyone is continuously &quot;doxxed&quot; and bombared with perfectly
targetted ads <em>a lÃ </em> Minority Report.</p>
<p>More important than that is <em>systemic privacy</em>. In a system with glass
walls like Bitcoin, criminals, governments, corporations and regulatory
agencies realize that it is very easy for them to abuse and exploit
people. Expect the maximum amount of extortion, the maximum amount of
taxes on increasingly mundane things and the maximum amount
micromanagement.</p>
<p>While you might not be able to imagine in your mind's eye all the
terrible things that might happen with a fully monitorable currency,
needless to say, it will contain what are, in effect, indescribable
Lovecraftian monsters from the blackest Stygian depths. Bitcoin is the
opposite of freedom. It is giving a <em>carte blanche</em> to all the world's
worst people to prey on innocents.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-monero">The Solution: Monero</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.getmonero.org/"><img alt="monero icon" src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/xmr.svg" />Monero</a> (also
known by its ticker &quot;XMR&quot;) is an exception to this.</p>
<p>Monero is a digital currency that has the blockchain technology of
Bitcoin, but has in its core very smartly designed tech to keep the
transactions on this public blockchain totally opaque. It takes what
we've learned from Bitcoin and makes a complete project that can
function, in fact <em>is functioning</em> in real life.</p>
<p>Firstly, the technologies which make the Monero blockchain private:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Ring signatures</em> to protect sender privacy. All transactions
are jointly signed by not just the actual sender, but ten other
addresses. Security by obscurity and plausible deniability.</li>
<li><em>Stealth addresses</em> to protect receiver privacy. Instead of
one address on the blockchain, you technically have a different
address for every single transaction and only by your private view
key can you see that they are yours.</li>
<li><em>Ring confidential transactions</em> to obscure the amount sent.</li>
</ol>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/satoshi_monero.webp" /><figcaption>The creator of Bitcoin really intended to create what Monero would later become. Bitcoin itself is incomplete.</figcaption></figure>

<p>None of this means any complication for the user. Monero works just like
any other cryptocurrency and if you use the <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/#gui">default graphical Monero
wallet</a>, it's just as easy to
use Electrum or something else for Bitcoin.</p>
<h3 id="monero-is-for-normal-people">Monero is for normal people</h3>
<p>Monero is often portrayed as being subversive because it is coming to
totally replace Bitcoin on the dark net for illegal transactions. It
often has a reputation associated with those potentially criminal
purposes it could be used for (same thing with Bitcoin before blockchain
monitoring became a science). Monero is not doing anything illegal that
cash couldn't do beforehand, but there's a more important point:</p>
<p><strong>Much more evil can be done with public transactions than private
transactions: they can cause blackmail, rumors, gossip-mongering,
witchhunts, stalking and targeted robberies and attacks.</strong> Seasoned
criminals know how to juggle Bitcoin and other non-cryptic
cryptocurrencies to avoid compromising privacy; normal people do not and
can fall prey to some of the worst things just by using Bitcoin for
normal things in normal ways.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, <strong>it's not Monero that's weird or subversive or
niche, it's Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies</strong>. Privacy is a bare
minimum for any functioning currency. Currency users deserve that and no
currency could function without it. The dollar, the euro, the renminbi
and every other currency by definition has the same privacy features as
Monero. Bitcoin just doesn't have that.</p>
<h3 id="monero-solves-all-of-bitcoins-other-problems">Monero solves all of Bitcoin's other problems.</h3>
<p>Bitcoin also has other drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bitcoin block size is limited to such a small size that spenders
have to compete with massive fees to get their transactions
processed. It often takes $10 of Bitcoin to send $5 of Bitcoin.</li>
<li>It is unclear if the Bitcoin have incentives to continue once all
Bitcoins are mined.</li>
<li>Bitcoin mining is increasingly centralized and requires extreme
specialty ASIC hardware to compete.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these pale in comparison to the privacy issue, and a lot of smoke
is generated by random coins trying to solve these issues, but Monero
has a solution for them all.</p>
<h4 id="1-monero-has-low-transaction-fees">1. Monero has low transaction fees.</h4>
<p>Monero has variable block size that avoids this issue as well, as long
with a disincentive for large blocksizes to prevent spurious
transactions (that could otherwise be theoretically used in an attack to
compromise network privacy).</p>
<h4 id="2-monero-will-be-mined-forever">2. Monero will be mined forever.</h4>
<p>The second issue is the big question mark behind the whole Bitcoin
system. Once all Bitcoins are mined, will miners continue to process
transactions if they are paid by fees only?</p>
<p>This isn't an issue for Monero because there is never a point where the
block reward for mining is zero. It will eventually stagnate at 0.6 XMR
for eternity, which is a supply inflation which approaches zero over
time and avoids the issue of no block rewards. This is called <em>tail emission</em>.</p>
<p>Note also that any solution to Bitcoin's first problem above, will
necessarily exacerbate the second problem. If you solve the fee problem,
you make the mining incentive problem worse. If there is the Lightning
Network or something else that reduces Bitcoin's fees dramatically, the
chance of those lower fees maintaining miners will decrease
dramatically.</p>
<p>I will say, if you think that the capped supply of Bitcoin will work out
fine and might be better, you can still have the benefits of Monero with
<a href="https://wownero.org"><img alt="" src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/wow.svg" />Wownero</a>, which is a Monero fork
with a capped supply and doge-tier memes (it also has a higher ring
signature size of 22 which might theoretically be better for privacy (or
overkill)). <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wownero/">(See on
Coinmarketcap)</a> They also
have <a href="https://suchwow.xyz/">a meme site</a>.</p>
<h4 id="3-monero-stays-decentralized-by-avoiding-mass-mining">3. Monero stays decentralized by avoiding mass-mining.</h4>
<p>Monero is specifically designed to avoid allowing specialty hardware
(ASICs) participate in mining. This makes individual mining on consumer
computers more possible for longer and makes it hard to farm Monero.
They use a technology called
<a href="https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/randomx.html">RandomX</a>
to do this.</p>
<h3 id="other-monero-perks">Other Monero Perks</h3>
<p>In short, Monero is cryptocurrency done right. Bitcoin was a great proof
of concept, but Monero fixes all the issues that the Bitcoin project
brought to attention.</p>
<p>There are yet more good features of Monero that are worth mentioning:</p>
<h4 id="optional-transparency-with-private-view-keys">Optional Transparency with Private View Keys</h4>
<p>In some cases, you might <em>not</em> want privacy, but transparency with
Monero. Suppose you're running a kind of non-profit that want's to
proudly show all their financials to potential donnors. Monero allows
this too with <em>Private View Keys</em>. You can publish your private
view keys on your website for your transactions to visible to whoever
has them.</p>
<h4 id="monero-is-actively-developed-and-improved">Monero is actively developed and improved.</h4>
<p>Monero users and developers are constantly trying to improve, break and
stress-test the technology. A lot of the features I've mentioned here
have been added to Monero since its founding. If you want to have an in
depth look at the history of Monero's development and technology, you
can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsSYUeVwrHBnAUre2G_LYDsdo-tD0ov-y">this video series &quot;Breaking
Monero&quot;</a>
where some guys overview how Monero has overcome previous issues to
become the prime privacy coin of today.</p>
<h2 id="using-and-holding-monero">Using and Holding Monero</h2>
<p>If you're reading this, I'll assume you're at least superficially
familiar with cryptocurrencies and probably have some Bitcoin. Even if
that's not so, just follow the links and you're smart enough to get
started.</p>
<h3 id="wallets">Wallets</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/">Get a Monero wallet here</a> from
their main site. Write down and store your wallet seed where you will
never lose it.</p>
<h3 id="getting-monero">Getting Monero</h3>
<p>The first thing I recommend everyone should do is put your public
address on your website for donations and produce high-quality writing
and other website content. Monero users will usually be more likely to
send small Monero donations since transaction fees are low. This also
increases the profile of Monero in the eyes of anyone who sees it, which
is a good costless investment for you now. Cryptocurrencies are driven
by networking effects. Note that you can make a QR code with <code>qrencode</code>
or an online generator if you're a true-blue normie.</p>
<p>The unofficial site <a href="https://www.monero.how/">Monero.how</a> lists many
exchanges where you can exchange Bitcoin or Ethereum for Monero and
store it on your private wallet, including many that don't require KYC
(sending in an ID).</p>
<p>The site <a href="https://localmonero.co/">Local Monero</a> is even an anonymous
service where you can mail in cash to exchange with a trusted Monero
vendor or vice versa.</p>
<p>I also recommend using <a href="https://bisq.network/">Bisq</a> for the highest
level of privacy. It is a peer-to-peer and totally anonymous exchange
which even creates its own Tor service automatically. You can exchange
XMR for BTC there too.</p>
<p><a href="https://localmonero.co/nojs/knowledge/monero-atomic-swaps">There are also Bitcoin/Monero atomic swaps in the
works.</a> This
is something very new, but when it happens and goes fully public, you
might expect a lot of value in Bitcoin moving over into Monero.</p>
<h3 id="use-now-or-to-hodl">Use now or to HODL?</h3>
<p>They also keep a small list of <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/community/merchants/">the growing number of services that
accept Monero</a>.
Everything from online services, to houses, to computer parts and more.
I also keep a <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/crypto.html">Monero donation address</a> public and
recommend others to do so as well. Since Monero transaction fees are so
low, microtransactions and small donations are easy.</p>
<p>Although if you're persuaded by my case here, you might just want to
HODL Monero for the most part and expect that it will rise. As I'm
writing this (April 21, 2021) Monero has increased a lot recently in the
ongoing bullrun, but it is still proportionately far lower than it was
in comparison with Bitcoin in the 2017 run. I have no clue whether it
will moon or crash hard at the end of the bullrun or anything, all I can
say is that I think the technological fundamentals are far better than
Bitcoin and all other currencies and its only getting scarcer.</p>
<p>What separates Monero from everything else is that it is a gimmickless
currency that has all the bare minimums of privacy. It is Bitcoin
perfected. It's what Bitcoin should've been. That's it.</p>

## My blog system now has tagging (all pure POSIX shell of course)
 - [https://lukesmith.xyz/updates/my-blog-system-now-has-tagging-all-pure-posix-shell-of-course/](https://lukesmith.xyz/updates/my-blog-system-now-has-tagging-all-pure-posix-shell-of-course/)

<p>This isn't live on the <a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/lb">old blog system's
Github</a>, but partially inspired by
by <a href="https://based.cooking">Based Cooking</a>'s tag system which is based
on <a href="https://pedantic.software/git/blogit">blogit</a>, I've added in the
feature to tag articles.</p>
<p>I've been wanting to write more articles and informational pages on my
website, but doing that with no organization is somewhat impratical. I
now have a tagcloud <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">on my homepage</a>.</p>
<p>My issue with <a href="https://pedantic.software/git/blogit">blogit</a>, the tool
used for Based.Cooking is that it is <em>slow</em>, mainly due to the fact that
for every file, it has multiple system/program calls (<code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>,
etc. might be called for each article or tag).</p>
<p>Here's an example of what I do, just for info. Instead of looking
through each file and calling <code>grep</code> and friends each time to get file
information, the title, the tags, etc., I merely run <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>
once to get all the info from all files:</p>
<pre><code># Awk prints out the filename, title and keywords/tag lines and Sed rearranges them for parsibility
output=&quot;$(awk 2&gt;/dev/null '
    /&lt;title&gt;/ {printf &quot;
&quot; FILENAME $0};
    /keywords/ {printf $0}' &quot;$webdir/$artdir&quot;/*html |
        sed &quot;s/\s*&lt;meta.*keywords.*content=[\&quot;']/|/
            s/\s*&lt;title&gt;\s*/;/
            s/\(\s\+\|[\&quot;']&gt;$\)/ /g
            s/^\s*//
            s/,//g
            s/\( *&amp;ndash.*\)*&lt;\/title&gt;//&quot; | grep &quot;|&quot;)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, instead of recursing and reading every file and manually running
the same <code>grep</code> or <code>sed</code> commands each time, just recurse through the
output of that previous command stored in <code>$output</code>.</p>
<p>Actually, I realize in the title of this post, I lied! It actually
isn't POSIX shell, but bash, but for a very good reason. Bash has a
built-in that capitalizes strings:</p>
<pre><code>$ name=luke
$ echo &quot;${name^}&quot;
Luke
</code></pre>
<p>POSIX shell lacks such a feature and would have to call an external
program like <code>sed</code> or <code>tr</code> to capitalize strings, which I would need
when later in the script recursing through tag names. This actually is a
good case of when bash is faster to use, since it has the feature built
into it, without needing to call external programs.</p>
<p>Of course I'm sure someone will email me saying that there is some
(albeit perhaps less elegant) way of capitalizing the first character of
a string in POSIX sh...</p>
<p>I might make my new blog system Makefile-based like blogit to get the
perks of that, but I've always found Makefile syntax in a kind of
disturbing and confusing uncanny valley. I know that's a silly thing to
say.</p>
