Ahead Apex Legends Legacy season, Respawn released a new trailer that gave us the backstory of Kairi Imahara, an upcoming legend. Sticking to the themes of legacy, the trailer was packed with references and easter eggs from the Titanfall universe.
Notes: Ahead of the start of Apex Legends Legacy, Respawn released Northstar, a brand-new trailer that showcased the upcoming season's playable character: Kairi "Valkyrie" Imahara. And sticking with the theme of "legacy," the Northstar trailer contains several references to the rest of the Titanfall universe.

In the video above, Jordan Ramée details all of the Easter eggs and references that we've managed to find in the trailer. Some are rather obvious, like the appearance of Blisk and Rampart. Others, however, are a bit more subtle, like the appearance of several Apex Predators prior to the Battle of Typhon.

Alongside the addition of Valkyrie, Legacy will also introduce a brand-new bow weapon and Olympus map overhaul. The bow, called the Bocek Bow, will be a new mid-range option for Respawn's battle royale. Meanwhile, the pristine look of Olympus will be replaced with an infested metropolis that's filled with plantlife. 

Apex Legends Legacy is scheduled to begin May 4.

After over a month of waiting, the Warzone's zombies have finally taken over. Join Richie as he plays through the event to find out the fate of Verdansk.

For more than a month, Zombies have infected Warzone's Verdansk map. Recent blog posts from Activision indicate that all hope is lost and that it's the end of Verdansk as we know it. To find out what's happening, Richie is here to play through the event to find out the fate of Warzone's premiere map.

Beginning in Season 2, the mysterious Vodianoy ship made its way from Rebirth Island to Verdansk. Players in the gulag area began hearing a haunting message from the doomed ship's captain, Rosental. Turns out his ship was infested with zombies and toxic Nova 6 gas. Little by little throughout season 2, zombies began to infect Verdansk. From the gulag to the dam, the infection rate rose from 5%-100%. Players were able to interact with the undead and receive rewards for killing hoards throughout numerous locations.

Recently zombies started to leave behind plague zones that could turn players into zombies themselves. While this was building to something larger, the experience was panned for its slow pace and confusing marketing. Today, we put our theories to rest and find out what's really going to happen to Verdasnk and if it will finally get nuked.

Verdansk is lost. Warzone’s zombie takeover comes to a close in this season-ending event. Watch as we figure out what becomes of Verdansk, and what’s in store for Warzone players.

Call of Duty: Warzone's Verdansk map has been overrun by zombies. With the infestation spreading to 100%, watch how events unfold in Call of Duty's latest event, Operation: Rapid Sunder. In this gameplay, you'll see Warzone players fight to survive expanding plague zones before a nuclear missile inevitably wipes out Verdansk. This limited-time mode falls within a short window of time, so if you weren't able to be there yourself, you're in the right place. 

The nuke event finally kicks off Cold War Season 3 that adds news operators, maps, and weapons to the game. As of this point we're not sure what this nuke means for Verdansk and if we're finally getting the rumored map changes. The next phase of this event takes place on a night version of Rebirth Island where players will unravel the mystery of what just happened. 

Stay tuned to GameSpot for more coverage of Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone Season 3 as this event continues to unfold.

Apex Legends Legacy is scheduled to begin May 4, following the conclusion of the game's War Games event. Legacy will add a new playable character, weapon, and map overhaul to Apex Legends.

In the video above, Jordan Ramée details everything we know about Legacy so far, such as who the new playable character is. Kairi "Valkyrie" Imahara is the daughter of Titanfall 2's Viper, taking to the skies in Apex Legends with a jetpack fashioned from the remains of her father's Northstar Titan.

Alongside Valkyrie, Legacy will add the Bocek Bow, a powerful mid-range weapon. The new season will also redesign Olympus, which will become infested with plantlife. As usual, the new season will also add a new battle pass to unlock and challenges to complete, though Respawn is cryptically teasing that there will be something more this time around.

Respawn recently celebrated Apex Legends reaching 100 million players. Apex Legends is also getting a mobile port called Apex Legends Mobile, which will begin beta testing this spring.

Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are entering Season 3 with limited-time events, new operators including Wraith, new weapons including the PPSH-41, new 6v6 maps like the Yamantau mountain, a new scorestreak, and added content for Zombies. 

Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are entering Season 3 with some huge changes to core multiplayer and Warzone. Cold War is getting three new operators, including Wraith, Knight, and Antonov. Not to be left out, Modern Warfare’s Captain Price will also be joining the roster. Season 3 will add six new weapons:PPSh-41: SMG, Swiss K31: Sniper Rifle, Ballistic Knife, CARV.2: Tactical Rifle, AMP63: Pistol, and a Baseball Bat. 

In terms of locations, Cold War picks up four multiplayer locations, which are Yamanatau, Diesel, Standoff, and Duga. Yamantau is a mountainous 6v6 map; Diesel supports multiple player counts and is set in a badlands gas station; Standoff is a classic Black Ops 2 remake map, and Duga is a multi-team map set around the massive radar array in the Ural Mountains. Alongside these maps are added modes, such as Sticks and Stones, as well as Multi-Team Elimination, which sounds a lot like classic battle royale with teams fleeing radiation zones. Finally, there’s a new mid-tier Scorestreak: Strafe Run that lasts longer than comparable streaks Napalm Strike and is designed for better area denial. 

On the other hand, Zombies fans are getting the new Field Upgrade: Toxic Growth, a special perk that can be used in round-based maps and Outbreak, which slows zombies with a deadly growth of toxic thorns. The Duga region will also come to Outbreak with new secrets to find. 

Finally, the Warzone map event has entered a Containment Protocol phase with Corruption Zones springing up around the map that can turn players into zombies leading up to Operation Rapid Sunder on Wednesday, April 21st.
