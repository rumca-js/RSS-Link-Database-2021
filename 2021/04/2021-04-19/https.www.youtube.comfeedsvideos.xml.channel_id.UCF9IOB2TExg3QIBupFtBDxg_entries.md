Prof Mark Walport, UK's former chief scientific adviser

These decisions are almost inevitably taken a bit too late in truth, but what's absolutely clear is that this variant is more transmissible in India

Becoming the dominant variant in India

so there's good reasons for wanting to keep it out of the country if at all possible

Most people who have travelled from or through India in the last 10 days will be refused entry

Janssen pause lifting Friday 23rd April

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/18/pause-johnson-johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-likely-be-lifted-by-friday-fauci-says/

Dr. Fauci

By Friday, we should have an answer as to where we’re going with it

I would think that we’re not going to go beyond Friday in the extension of this pause

I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment

I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.’

The six cases of the blood clots were in women ages 18 and 48

Late summer or early fall (Dr. Fauci)

FDA and the CDC will probably decide on a third booster shot

Expects high school students will be vaccinated by the fall school term

Elementary schoolchildren will receive vaccine doses by the first quarter of 2022.

Now

Just over half of all adults in the US, at least one dose

131 million people

Sunday, 84 million, fully vaccinated

Anyone aged over 18 is now eligible

Dr. Fauci

US remains in a precarious position

US cases going up
