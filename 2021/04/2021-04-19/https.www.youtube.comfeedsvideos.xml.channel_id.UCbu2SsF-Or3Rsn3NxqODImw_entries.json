Cold War is getting three new operators, including Wraith, Knight, and Antonov. Not to be left out, Modern Warfare\u2019s Captain Price will also be joining the roster. Season 3 will add six new weapons:PPSh-41: SMG, Swiss K31: Sniper Rifle, Ballistic Knife, CARV.2: Tactical Rifle, AMP63: Pistol, and a Baseball Bat.\u00a0\n\nIn terms of locations, Cold War picks up four multiplayer locations, which are Yamanatau, Diesel, Standoff, and Duga. Yamantau is a mountainous 6v6 map; Diesel supports multiple player counts and is set in a badlands gas station; Standoff is a classic Black Ops 2 remake map, and Duga is a multi-team map set around the massive radar array in the Ural Mountains. Alongside these maps are added modes, such as Sticks and Stones, as well as Multi-Team Elimination, which sounds a lot like classic battle royale with teams fleeing radiation zones. Finally, there\u2019s a new mid-tier Scorestreak: Strafe Run that lasts longer than comparable streaks Napalm Strike and is designed for better area denial.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, Zombies fans are getting the new Field Upgrade: Toxic Growth, a special perk that can be used in round-based maps and Outbreak, which slows zombies with a deadly growth of toxic thorns. The Duga region will also come to Outbreak with new secrets to find.\u00a0\n\nFinally, the Warzone map event has entered a Containment Protocol phase with Corruption Zones springing up around the map that can turn players into zombies leading up to Operation Rapid Sunder on Wednesday, April 21st.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbppSp9WaE4", "date_published": "2021-04-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Apex Legends | Stories from the Outlands \u2013  Northstar", "description": "Check out the all new Apex Legends | Stories from the Outlands - Northstar trailer!

Resident Evil Village looks like a combination of Resident Evil 7 and the more action-oriented Resident Evil 4. The village portion of the game has heavy Resident Evil 4 vibes, with Ethan fighting through hordes of werewolf-like creatures. In the castle, though, Ethan will have to deal with the vampiric Lady Dimitrescu and her daughters. The castle looks like a big change of pace from the more action-heavy village are, as you'll primarily be avoiding Lady Dimitrescu and her daughters, rather than fighting them. Resident Evil Village's next demo, which drops at 5 PM PDT Saturday, April 24, will allow you to explore the Castle for 30 minutes on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNsufTHEra4", "date_published": "2021-04-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Zelda BOTW Pro Speedrunner and Combat Expert React to New Viral Clips", "description": "We gathered Breath of the Wild pro speedrunner Limcube and combat expert RinHara5aki together to break down some speedruns, combat, glitches, and more.\n\nBreath of the Wild is the game that keeps on giving, with people still finding new things four years later.
