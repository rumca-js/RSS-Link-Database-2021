Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | April 26, 2021\nWhen D.R.A.M. played the Tiny Desk back in 2017, he made a couple of things clear to us: His playfully dynamic personality was primed for the spotlight, and beneath the catchy hooks, there's a real singer waiting to come out. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he does a complete 180. \"It's like a new beginning. Full circle. So this time, call me Shelley.\" he says, following the opening track, \"Exposure.\" Everything is new. Silk pajamas and slippers replace the trench coat and plush beanie, and thanks to lifestyle changes, he's slimmed down quite a bit and goes by his government name now: Shelley.\n\nThe shift from lighthearted melodic hip-hop to full-on R&B crooner shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who's seen him perform live. It feels like it's his way of saying, \"Now that I have your attention, allow me to introduce myself.\" We still get glimpses of the \"Big Baby\" here and there \u2014 the charm, a little bit of silliness, and the million-dollar grin \u2014 but other than that, it's grown folks business and vocally flawless performance. For the Shelley Show, he gathers a groovy band in front of a massive bookshelf and runs through selections, including the premiere of \"Rich & Famous\" from his upcoming self-titled project, due out on April 29, his late mother's birthday. If D.R.A.M. was the ploy to break into the music industry, then Shelley is the longevity play.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Exposure\"\n\"The Lay Down\"\n\"Cooking With Grease\"\n\"Rich & Famous\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nShelley: vocals\nSlimWav: keys\nSensei Bueno: guitar\nKeith \"KJ\" Glover: drums\nTrey Mitchell: bass\nYuli: viola\nCrystal Carr: vocals\nDavid Fuller: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Junia Abaidoo, Carlon Ramong, Steve Othello\nAudio: Paul Katzman, Adrian Porter, Raul Lopez\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Maia Stern, Bob Boilen\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#shelley #dram #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xzmBkhyGxQ", "date_published": "2021-04-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK: ChocQuibTown", "description": "LaTesha Harris | April 25, 2021\nTiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK is the electrifying kick-off to AFROPUNK's \"Black Spring\" festival. The virtual celebration, hosted by\u00a0Jorge \"Gitoo\" Wright, features performances from ChocQuibTown, Calma Carmona, Luedji Luna and Nenny. AFROPUNK, born out of a 2003 short film by the same name, is an international movement and music festival centered on Black exploration and rebellion. Starting as a way to create space for the unacknowledged presence and influence of Black culture in a predominantly white punk scene, AFROPUNK has since evolved into a distinct, multi-genre experience.\n\"Black Spring\" was created to spotlight outstanding talent in Afro-Latine and Afro-Caribbean music across the globe. The Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK program aims for the same. The showcase's four artists have come to the Tiny Desk to honor their homes and celebrate the art their heritage has inspired. Learn more about them below.\n\nChocQuibTown\n\"\u00a1T\u00fa sabes!\" Carlos \"Tostao\" Valencia exclaims after Colombian hip-hop trio ChocQuibTown performs its first song, the energetic \"Somos Pac\u00edfico.\" \"ChocQuibTown, straight from Colombia, from the Pacific coast,\" he says. \"We call it Africa inside Colombia, we got the flavor, we got the flow.\" ChocQuibTown \u2014 named after the coastal area the trio hails from \u2014 is a family affair comprised of siblings Miguel \"Slow\" Martinez and Gloria \"Goyo\" Martinez, the latter of which is married to Valencia. In 2000, the trio formed to promote their neglected corner of Colombia's culture; today, ChocoQuibTown's music blends the traditionality of Afro-Latin jazz with the modernity of hip-hop to create a singular, yet versatile sound.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Somos Pac\u00edfico\"\n \u2022 \"De Donde Vengo Yo\"\n \u2022 \"Pa Olvidarte\"\n \u2022 \"Qu\u00e9 L\u00e1stima\"\n \u2022 \"Lo Que Quieras T\u00fa\"\n \u2022 \"Cuando Te Veo\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Goyo: vocals\n \u2022 Slow: vocals\n \u2022 Tostao: vocals\n \u2022 Carlos Palmet: bateria\n \u2022 Alejandro Garc\u00eda: guitar\n \u2022 Daniel Rodr\u00edguez \"Noize\": piano\n \u2022 Braulio Fern\u00e1ndez: bajo\n \u2022 Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez: trumpet, piano, vocals\n \u2022 Eignar Renteria: vocals\n \u2022 Yaima Saurez: vocals\n \u2022 Juancho Valencia: arrangements\n\nCREDITS\n\nVideo: Kevin Quiles, Roberto V\u00e9lez, Diego Valerio, MotionHaze, GoldenHour Music Group LLC\nAudio: Gabriel Gil, Waldy D.\n\nTiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Abby O'Neill\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkYN0mzY_2E", "date_published": "2021-04-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
