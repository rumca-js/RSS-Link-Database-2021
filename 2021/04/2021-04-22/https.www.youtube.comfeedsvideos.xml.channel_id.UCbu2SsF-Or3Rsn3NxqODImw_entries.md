Head back into the streets of Kamurocho with this side-by-side comparison of Judgment on PS4 Pro and PS5.

Judgment was originally released for PS4 in 2018 in Japan and 2019 in the West. The game stars Takayuki Yagami, a former lawyer turned private detective who’s hunting down the mystery of multiple Yakuza members getting their eyes gouged out. Judgment is a spin-off of the Yakuza games and has similar beat-em-up combat. But this game also includes detective sequences where you comb through an area to find details that might help your case. 

In this side-by-side video, we've put the original PS4 version (running on PS4 Pro) against the new PS5 version and we show off load times, cutscenes, combat, detective work, tailing people, and a chase sequence. The original PS4 version only ran at 30 frames per second and the new PS5 version goes up to 60 frames per second so you’ll definitely notice one is smoother than the other.

Judgment is now available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Stadia with refined visuals and running at 60fps. RGG Studio, the creators of Yakuza and Judgment, are also teasing a Judgment related announcement on May 7 at 7am PT. A countdown to that can be found here: http://ryu-ga-gotoku.com/20210507/

## Nier (Original) vs Nier Replicant Ver.1.2247 Graphics Comparison

See the differences in graphics, voice acting, and combat of the original PS3 release of Nier and the remastered Nier Replicant Ver.1.22474487139 for PS4.

The original Nier released in 2010 on PS3 and Xbox 360, and while it's story is timeless, it's gameplay elements weren't that great. Nier Replicant ver. 1.22, out now for PS4, Xbox One, and PC isn't quite a remake and not quite a remaster, but rather something in between--and it's an astonishing improvement over the original version. This comparison encompasses the PS3 version of the original Nier and the PS4 version of Nier Replicant.

This upgraded version of Nier Replicant uses a brand-new combat system that plays closer to Nier: Automata with features like new combo mechanics, a revamped magic system, lock-on enemy targeting, smoother player movement, higher resolution, better textures and assets, and a much smoother frame rate. And as you see in this comparison, it stars "brother Nier" instead of "father Nier."

In the video above, you'll see a fight against a floating dictionary in Emil's mansion to obtain some vital information. This should help you get a taste of how these two versions differ. You'll notice that the cutscenes have been recreated one-to-one and preserve the strong overall narrative Nier was always known for, but they look much better with the visual enhancements. If you listen close enough, you may also catch that the voiceovers have been re-recorded by the original cast to give a modern edge to what were already stellar performances.

Nier Replicant is out now, and if you're thinking about jumping into this tragic and emotional action-RPG, be sure to check out our full Nier Replicant review and prepare to cry.

Call Of Duty Warzone is finally nuking the old Modern Warfare map and replacing it with a 1980s Cold War-themed Verdansk. Here are all the changes coming, including new and redone locations, new weapons, and how the limited-time event will play out with zombies, Plague Zones, and more than one nuclear weapon.

Call Of Duty: Warzone has had the same map for over a year now, and Operation Rapid Sunder is changing that, starting with a four-part event that ends with Modern Warfare’s battle royale map being nuked forever and replaced with Verdansk 84. This nuke event has been teased for a number of seasons, with players finding bunkers and nuclear weapons on the map followed by a zombie invasion. 

The four parts of the current event are Escalation Protocol, where zombies travel across the map, eventually leaving corruption zones in their wake. Phase two is the Destruction Of Verdsansk, where players race against a countdown clock while the Corruption Zones expand in a last-ditch effort to save Verdansk, which does not go well. Phase three sees players taken to Rebirth Island on a night map and tasked with unraveling the mystery of what just happened on Verdansk and will end with yet another nuke being launched. The final and fourth phase will transport players back in time to Verdansk in the 1980s.

The new Warzone map will have a number of environmental and location changes. The map is based on locations from Black Ops Cold War and has seven new locations and five revamped areas. The spring environment is greener with thicker forests. Urban areas sport 80’s colors and less dense cities. In a final but sad note, the Modern Warfare battle-royale map is gone forever, thanks for the memories.

Though antiquated in some respects, Nier Replicant will tear your heart out with its timeless story, endearing and tragic characters, and beautiful soundtrack.

Michael cherishes Nier: Automata as one of his all-time favorites, and recently played the original Nier and found something just as special. Nier Replicant recaptures that magic, and he'll never forget what Emil, Weiss, and Kaine mean to him. He spent 40 hours with the PS4 version of Nier Replicant (playing on PS5) and saw all of its endings, including the brand-new Ending E. A review code was provided by Square Enix.
