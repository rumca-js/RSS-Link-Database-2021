The game stars Takayuki Yagami, a former lawyer turned private detective who\u2019s hunting down the mystery of multiple Yakuza members getting their eyes gouged out. Judgment is a spin-off of the Yakuza games and has similar beat-em-up combat. But this game also includes detective sequences where you comb through an area to find details that might help your case.\u00a0\n\nIn this side-by-side video, we've put the original PS4 version (running on PS4 Pro) against the new PS5 version and we show off load times, cutscenes, combat, detective work, tailing people, and a chase sequence. The original PS4 version only ran at 30 frames per second and the new PS5 version goes up to 60 frames per second so you\u2019ll definitely notice one is smoother than the other.\n\nJudgment is now available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Stadia with refined visuals and running at 60fps. RGG Studio, the creators of Yakuza and Judgment, are also teasing a Judgment related announcement on May 7 at 7am PT.

Nier Replicant ver. 1.22, out now for PS4, Xbox One, and PC isn't quite a remake and not quite a remaster, but rather something in between--and it's an astonishing improvement over the original version.\u00a0This comparison encompasses the PS3 version of the original Nier and the PS4 version of Nier Replicant.\n\nThis upgraded version of Nier Replicant uses a brand-new combat system that plays closer to Nier: Automata with features like new combo mechanics, a revamped magic system, lock-on enemy targeting, smoother player movement, higher resolution, better textures and assets, and a much smoother frame rate. And as you see in this comparison, it stars \"brother Nier\" instead of \"father Nier.\"\n\nIn the video above, you'll see a fight against a floating dictionary in Emil's mansion to obtain some vital information. This should help you get a taste of how these two versions differ. You'll notice that the cutscenes have been recreated one-to-one and preserve the strong overall narrative Nier was always known for, but they look much better with the visual enhancements. If you listen close enough, you may also catch that the voiceovers have been re-recorded by the original cast to give a modern edge to what were already stellar performances.\n\nNier Replicant is out now, and if you're thinking about jumping into this tragic and emotional action-RPG, be sure to check out our full Nier Replicant review and prepare to cry.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSla4s7D_KY", "date_published": "2021-04-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Apex Legends \u2013 Legacy Launch Trailer", "description": "Check out the all new Apex Legends Legacy launch trailer featuring the all new character Valkyrie as well as a surprise appearance from Ash. \n\n#ApexLegends #ApexLegendsLegacy", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLRHPi8-6DQ", "date_published": "2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "COD Warzone Verdansk '84 Livestream", "description": "Call Of Duty nuked the Verdansk Warzone map and a trailer has shown off what looks like the new one.

Here are all the changes coming, including new and redone locations, new weapons, and how the limited-time event will play out with zombies, Plague Zones, and more than one nuclear weapon.\n\nCall Of Duty: Warzone has had the same map for over a year now, and Operation Rapid Sunder is changing that, starting with a four-part event that ends with Modern Warfare\u2019s battle royale map being nuked forever and replaced with Verdansk 84. This nuke event has been teased for a number of seasons, with players finding bunkers and nuclear weapons on the map followed by a zombie invasion.\u00a0\n\nThe four parts of the current event are Escalation Protocol, where zombies travel across the map, eventually leaving corruption zones in their wake. Phase two is the Destruction Of Verdsansk, where players race against a countdown clock while the Corruption Zones expand in a last-ditch effort to save Verdansk, which does not go well. Phase three sees players taken to Rebirth Island on a night map and tasked with unraveling the mystery of what just happened on Verdansk and will end with yet another nuke being launched. The final and fourth phase will transport players back in time to Verdansk in the 1980s.\n\nThe new Warzone map will have a number of environmental and location changes. The map is based on locations from Black Ops Cold War and has seven new locations and five revamped areas. The spring environment is greener with thicker forests. Urban areas sport 80\u2019s colors and less dense cities. In a final but sad note, the Modern Warfare battle-royale map is gone forever, thanks for the memories.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Qq1-xZT0A", "date_published": "2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty Warzone | Season 3 Trailer", "description": "Check out the all new season 3 trailer for Call of Duty Warzone and drop into Verdansk84 with your squad today! \n\n#COD #Warzone #CallofDuty", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXzMOUCYGBs", "date_published": "2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Cold War Season 3 Hunt for Adler Cinematic", "description": "Cold War Season 3 new operators Wraith and Knight nuke Mt.
