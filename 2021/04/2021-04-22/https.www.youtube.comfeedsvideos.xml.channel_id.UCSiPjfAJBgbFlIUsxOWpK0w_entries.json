Not only did he produce this Pomplamoose song, we also WROTE the whole thing together. So *technically* this should be called \"Read Me\" Ben Rose ft. Pomplamoose. I'm also open to changing the bandname to PomplaRose. \n\nSave this song on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/2r3Yqkh\nFollow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/pomplamoosemusic\nBecome a patron of our music (to vote on the songs we cover and get merch and stuff like that): http://www.patreon.com/pomplamoose\n\nAn original song by Pomplamoose.\n\nCREDITS\nVocals: Nataly Dawn\nKeys, Mandola, Acoustic Guitar, Percussion: Jack Conte\nDrums, Keys, Electric Guitar, Percussion: Ben Rose\nMixing/Mastering: Yianni AP\nProducer: Ben Rose\nCamera Operator: Nataly Dawn\nAssistant to the Regional Camera Operator: Ben Rose\nVideo Editor: Athena Wheaton\nColorist: Charlene Gibbs\nWardrobe: Elle Olsen\n\nRecorded at our home studio in San Francisco.\n\n#Pomplamoose #IndieRock #ReadMe\n\nLYRICS\n\nI would like to know you\nWould that be alright\nTake you out for soda\nOn a summer night\nI\u2019m an open book\nWon\u2019t you take the time\nCause I\u2019m a little old-fashioned\nCan I hold your hand\nTell me your favorite song\nWe can play it on my walkman\nCause I\u2019m an open book\nSo won\u2019t you take the time\nTo read me\n\nTell me how it\u2019s been\nTell me how it\u2019s gonna be\nCome on take a chance\nHoney don\u2019t you want to read me?\n\nSo you were born in Ohio\nBut then you moved out West\nAnd you bite your nails I know\nAnd then keep them in your pockets\nAre you an open book\nOr just an easy rhyme\nToo easy\n\nI used to watch a lot\nOf Dawson\u2019s Creek\nWasn\u2019t allowed\nBut I would sneak upstairs\nOn weekends\nTurn the volume down low\nAnd hope no one\nWas listening\nAre you listening\nDo you ever dream of summer camp\nSlow dance, sweaty hands\nFirst kiss, what did I miss\nWhat did I miss\nAre you listening\nCause I miss everything\n\nAnd if you were a novel\nI would check you out\nK that\u2019s a really bad line\nBut that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about\nOh Thank gosh you\u2019re laughing\nYou might have figured how\nTo read me", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=febnsUYUBYY", "date_published": "2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
