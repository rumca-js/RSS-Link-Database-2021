Hello and welcome to VIRTUALLY ODD! IT'S BACK! Today I have the XTAL 8k to show you all. I worked really hard on this one. We'll be going over the most expensive VR headset on the market that any consumer can buy, it's features, my thoughts on it, and some more explanation as to WHY it's so expensive. Once agian, I hope you enjoy. 

Thank you to VRGineers for sending out this XTAL for my to test out. No I didn't buy this, no I don't get to keep it lol. 

Edit: SOO! VRgineers (creators of XTAL) have offered a code to the community for 10% OFF of an XTAL if you want to buy one and I also get a few dollars back as well. If you want to buy an XTAL, hereâ€™s your link and code to use! Much love.
