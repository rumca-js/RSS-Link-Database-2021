We will cover his multiple trips to the East and Dol Guldur, how his presence brings out evil across the map, his physical form during the War of the Ring, and his strategy during the War of the Ring.\n\nAfter his defeat at the hands of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, Sauron goes into hiding, growing his strength and using all his cunning to craft a plan for vengeance.  Using his magic, his servants, and his newly found palantir, he will attempt to bend all of Middle-earth to his will.\n\nSauron in the First Age: https://youtu.be/-4PxPcmt8KA\nSauron in the Second Age: https://youtu.be/NhMGyTJVA4s\n\n*Hit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings!*  \n\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
