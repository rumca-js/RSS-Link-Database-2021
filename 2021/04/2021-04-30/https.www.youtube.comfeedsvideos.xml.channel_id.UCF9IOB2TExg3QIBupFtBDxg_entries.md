Prof Jonathan Van-Tam

If two people who both had two doses of vaccine, 

and have both served at least 14 days after their second dose, 

then I would be highly confident scientifically that if they were reputable vaccines then 
indeed it would be incredibly safe for those two people to meet

Paul Hunter, Professor of Medicine, University of East Anglia

True just now with B117

The issue is variants with escape mutations that are less affected by the vaccine, 
and we haven't come to clear understanding of what those risks are

Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2)

Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19)

Safety and effectiveness in UK community setting

1,607,620 users (2·4% of the UK population)

Methods

Prospective observational study

Self-reported systemic and local side-effects within 8 days

After one or two doses

Infection rates, after vaccine, diagnosed by PCR or lateral flow

Unvaccinated controls

Findings

Dec 8th 2020, and March 10th 2021

Vaccinated reporters, n = 627 383

Reactogenicity, (common, expected)

Systemic side-effects

Fatigue and headache (about 4% each)

Most frequently within the first 24 h

Lasted a mean of 1·01 days 

Fever

Chills or shivers

Nausea

Diarrhoea

Muscle pains

Joint pains

Local side effects

Tenderness and local pain

Redness

Swollen armpit glands

Warmth

Itch

Bruising

Pfizer

One dose, 282, 103 (13% SSE) (71.9% LSE)

Two doses, 28, 207 (22% SSE) (68.5% LSE)

Median, 41 days apart

Oxford AZ

One dose, 345 280 (33.7% SSE) (58.7% LSE)

In those with past infection after Pfizer

SSE x 2.9

LSE x 1.2

In those with past infection after Oxford AZ

SSE x 1.6

LSE x 1.4

Vaccinated people who became infected

Vaccine group, 3,106 of 103,622

Unvaccinated controls, 50,340 of 464,356

Reductions in infection risk

Started at 12 days after the first dose, to 21 days

Reaching - 60% Oxford AZ

Reaching - 58% for the Pfizer

Longer term benefits of vaccination after Pfizer

RR, 21 to 44 days - 69%

RR, 45 to 59 days, - 72%

In conclusion, short-term adverse effects of both vaccines are moderate in frequency, mild in severity, and short-lived. 

Adverse effects are more frequently reported in younger individuals, women, and among those who previously had COVID-19. 

The post-vaccine symptoms (both systemic and local) often last 1–2 days from the injection. 

Our data could be used to inform people on the likelihood of side-effects on the basis of their age and sex and the type of vaccine being administered. 

Furthermore, our data support results from randomised controlled trials in a large community-based scenario showing evidence of reduction in infection after 12 days and substantial protection after 3 weeks.
