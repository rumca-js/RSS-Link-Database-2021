<p>For those that use my SearX instance (which was formerly
<code>searx.lukesmith.xyz</code>), I have now relocated it to
<a href="https://searx.cedars.xyz">searx.cedars.xyz</a>, so if you use it as a
default search engine, remember to change its url.</p>
<p>For those who don't know what SearX is, it's a metasearch engine that
polls whatever search engines you want and aggregates the results. It is
free software that can be installed by anyone on any server.</p>
<p>Read more about it <a href="https://searx.me/">on their website</a>, or find
<a href="https://searx.space/">another instance to use</a>, or <a href="https://searx.github.io/searx/">install it on your
own server</a>.</p>
