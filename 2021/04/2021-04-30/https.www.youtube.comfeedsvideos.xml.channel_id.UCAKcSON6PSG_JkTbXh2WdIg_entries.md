Charlie Parr is our Minnesota Music Month featured artist for Thursday, April 29. 

Even though he grew up in southern Minnesota and has long been based in Duluth, Minn., Charlie Parr is known for his Piedmont blues style of guitar playing, building a solid career for his songwriting in that form, and citing influences such as Bukka White, Dave Van Ronk and Mississippi John Hurt. Over the course of his career, Charlie Parr has toured across North America and Europe, and he has performed in The Current studio several times as well as frequent appearances through the years at the MPR booth at the Minnesota State Fair.
