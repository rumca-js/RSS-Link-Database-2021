Back in 2012, Now, Now released their second album, \"Threads,\" and its success blew the band away. \"We were expecting for it to do the same thing as any of our other EPs,\" KC Dalager told Andrea Swensson on The Local Show. But along with band members Brad Hale and Jess Abbott, Dalager got written up in national publications; toured with fun., whose song \"We Are Young\" was just about to explode; and grew a fanbase few local bands can boast. However, Now, Now learned about overexertion the hard way. As they continued to say \"yes\" to every opportunity, they got more and more burned out.\n\nFive years later, Abbott parted ways with Now, Now to work on her project Tancred, but Hale and Dalager returned with new music: \"SGL,\" a punchy pop/rock single. Watch Now, Now's 2017 performance of that song, plus two songs from their 2012 release, \"Threads.\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"SGL\"\n3:24 \"Lucie, Too\"\n7:10 \"Prehistoric\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nKC Dalager \u2013 vocals, keys, guitar\nBrad Hale \u2013 drums, beats\nDanny O'Brien \u2013 guitar\nJef Sundquist \u2013 bass\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Eric Romani\nProduction: Andrea Swensson\n\nFIND MORE:\n2012 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/02/14/nownow-live\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/07/17/now-now-perform-in-the-current-studios\n2018 MPR booth at the State Fair session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/09/02/watch-now-now-perform-at-the-minnesota-state-fair\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#nownow #nownowband #nownowmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvAIg4pCnw8", "date_published": "2021-04-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
