This is the final showing for this rig for a while! 124 improvised techno with a few edits to keep it under 30 minutes.\nIf you like this style, check out my album Cast in Amber: https://fanlink.to/castinamber\nRead more about this rig here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/let-me-tell-you-46839588\nWatch a video about this rig here: https://youtu.be/Hwn6Yu_cJTI\nCheck out my NYMS set with this rig here: https://youtu.be/JG3NqDSmDeA\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching.
