Over the last three years, FRONTLINE has collaborated with ProPublica to investigate the rise of extremism in America. Now, in the aftermath of the assault on the U.S. Capitol, FRONTLINE, ProPublica and UC Berkeley's Investigative Reporting Program team up to examine how far-right groups were emboldened and encouraged by former President Trump and how individuals were radicalized and brought into the political landscape.

Watch "American Insurrection," a co-production between FRONTLINE, ProPublica and UC Berkeley’s Investigative Reporting Program, beginning April 13: https://to.pbs.org/31YcLl6
