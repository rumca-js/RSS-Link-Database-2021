Hello! Here is my updated 2021 list for the best VR games you can buy for the Quest and Quest 2! SO MANY amazing VR games have released for the platform over the past few months and so many amazing updates have revitalized many games. This is an exciting time to be a VR enthusiast and own a quest/quest 2. Never before have we had so many quality games to choose from. I did this list a little different, a bunch of the obvious "MUST HAVES" for the quest I left out of the list for the end of the video. This was mostly because every single list video usually has the same 5 games on it (rec room, superhot, VRChat, Beat Saber, Echo VR) and its taking up space that other games could be getting spotlight for. Hope you enjoy!

10- The Climb 2
9- Pistol Whip
8- Myst
