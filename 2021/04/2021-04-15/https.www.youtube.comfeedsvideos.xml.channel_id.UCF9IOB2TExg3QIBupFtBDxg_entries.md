Cerebral venous thrombosis: a retrospective cohort study of 513,284 confirmed COVID -19 cases and a comparison with 489,871 people receiving a COVID -19 mRNA vaccine

Can help contextualize the risks and benefits of vaccination in this regard

Using an electronic health records network

Absolute incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in the two weeks following:

(Incidence of portal vein thrombosis, PVT also assessed)

COVID-19 diagnosis (N=513,284)

Influenza (N=172,742)

Receipt of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines (N=489,871)

The incidence of CVT after COVID-19 diagnosis

CVT = 39.0 per million people

The incidence of CVT after influenza diagnosis

CVT = Zero per million people

Incidence of CVT after receiving BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine

CVT = 4.1 per million people

The incidence of PVT after COVID-19 diagnosis

PVT = 436

The incidence of PVT after influenza diagnosis

PVT = 98

Incidence of PVT after receiving BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine

PVT = 44 per million

CVT incidence observed across the entire health records network

0.41 per million people over any 2-week period

Laboratory test results, available in a subset of the COVID-19 patients, suggestive of:

Raised D-dimer, lowered fibrinogen, and an increased rate of thrombocytopenia in the CVT and PVT groups

CVT Mortality = 20% in 2 weeks after CoViD
PVT mortality = 18.8% in 2 weeks after CoViD

Latest estimate from the European Medicines Agency

Incidence associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine 

CVT = 5.0 per million people

Splanchnic thrombosis by the EMA following vaccination with ChAdOx1

(portal, splenic, mesenteric)

53 cases out of 34 million people

1.6 per million people

## Aspirate to vaccinate!

Do we need to change vaccination protocols?

Thrombocytopenia has been consistently reported following the administration of adenoviral gene transfer vectors

Adenovirus-induced thrombocytopenia is a potentially serious complication of gene therapy protocols using this type of vector. 

Understanding its mechanism may help the development of measures to prevent this adverse event. 

In this report, we have studied platelet-adenovirus interactions in vitro and in vivo after intravenous administration of adenovirus to mice. 

We show that adenovirus induces platelet activation and promotes the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates both in vitro and in vivo.

Thrombocytopenia occurs between 5 and 24 hours following intravenous administration of adenovirus to mice

Adenovirus activates platelets and induces rapid exposure of P-selectin

Adenovirus activates endothelial cells

Incorrect injection technique

Vaccine technique can be a rare cause of clots

State Serum Institute of Denmark, now recommends injection aspiration before injecting vaccine

There is suspicion as to whether accidental injection of the vaccine into a blood vessel could play a role

Intravascular administration may lead to a systemic inflammatory reaction leading to blood clots

Danish nursing council

Covid-19 vaccines should be given with aspiration before injection

https://sqd34kucpgoufz3qiuiswlotka--dsr-dk.translate.goog/politik-og-nyheder/nyhed/covid-19-vacciner-skal-gives-med-aspiration-foer-injektion

Aspiration is recommended for all approved covid-19 vaccines

Consistent with the Danish Health and Medicines Authority's guidelines

Vaccination personnel should ensure that they are injected correctly into a muscle and not into the bloodstream

Possible connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare but serious side effects with blood clots and bleeding

When vaccinating, it is important to make sure that the vaccine does not go directly into the bloodstream. 

UK and WHO guidelines

Vaccines should not be given intravenously. 

It is not necessary to aspirate the syringe after the needle is introduced into the muscle (WHO, 2004; Plotkin and Orenstein, 2004).
