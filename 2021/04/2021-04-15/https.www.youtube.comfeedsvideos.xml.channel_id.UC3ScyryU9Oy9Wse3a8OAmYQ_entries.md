On Dec. 11, 2008, Bernard L. Madoff confessed that his investment business was all "one big lie," a Ponzi scheme that cost investors $65 billion. In this 2009 documentary, FRONTLINE explored how Madoff became the new poster child for Wall Street gall, greed and corruption.

Through exclusive television interviews with those closest to Madoff's operation, veteran FRONTLINE correspondent Martin Smith and producer Marcela Gaviria unearthed the details of the world's first global Ponzi scheme — a deception that lasted longer, reached wider and cut deeper than any other business scandal in history — in The Madoff Affair.
