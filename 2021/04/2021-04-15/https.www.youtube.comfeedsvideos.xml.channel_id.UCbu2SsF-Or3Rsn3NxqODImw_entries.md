It's been love at first sight with Lady Dimitrescu, however, looks can surely be deceiving. And while we’re all a little busy fetishizing the tall vampire lady, what do we actually know about her?

Check out our complete Resident Evil timeline explained here: https://youtu.be/QkPgowr-T9g​ 

We’re only a few weeks away from the release of Resident Evil Village, but we still can’t seem to stop talking about the internet’s most notoriously tall vampire woman: Lady Alcina Dimitrescu. We’re all still very thirsty to know as much as possible about her, and thanks to the recent RE Village showcase we have a little more information on the tall lady--just enough to hold us over. 

In the above video, Kurt Indovina fulfills everyone’s stalkier desires, and uncovers everything we know so far about the Romanian vampire, Lady Dimitrescu. Kurt goes over her obvious height, being a vampire, and art director Tomonori Takano's inspirations, which include Morticia Adams and Hungarian noblewoman/serial killer Elizabeth Báthory. Carrying over from Resident Evil 7, there’s a returning motif of antagonistic family. Dimitrescu mentions Mother Miranda, her daughters, and a brother named Heisenberg. 

Resident Evil Village is very much a  continuation of the previous installment, carrying over RE7's first-person view and protagonist Ethan Winters, while taking direct inspiration from Resident Evil 4’s more gothic,and European influence. Still, there are many questions left unanswered, like whether or not Dimitrescu is actually the main antagonist, and why is Ethan’s child so important? 

Hopefully our dreams will be made true on May 7.

How is Genshin Impact after 6 months of not playing the game? We take a quick look and see if it still holds up since its September launch.

Genshin Impact is a massive game that, on its initial launch, was truly magical. But I think we won't be alone here to say that most people had a honeymoon phase, and the end game became the crossroads for many players. But six months later, picking up Genshin Impact again turned out to be an interesting experience because of a unique combination of traits this game has that we never thought about.

What has changed in Genshin Impact? What's been added? And how is it for returning players? We go over what we think while playing on the newest update.
