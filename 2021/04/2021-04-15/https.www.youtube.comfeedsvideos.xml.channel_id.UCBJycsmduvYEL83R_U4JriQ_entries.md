How did we all get so hyperconnected? I’m taking a look at where it all started – the simple phone – and how things developed. How we went from answering machines to AOL messenger to Facetime. But I’m also taking a look at where it’s all going; and I’m looking at tech that will one day allow us to communicate telepathically.

I’m taking a look at the tech predictions of the past that we thought would be our future – and in particular robots. I cast an eye back to the toy robots of the 60s, 70s, and 80s and some of the movies that spawned them. And along the way I talk to UrAvgConsumer and Chris Gethard.
