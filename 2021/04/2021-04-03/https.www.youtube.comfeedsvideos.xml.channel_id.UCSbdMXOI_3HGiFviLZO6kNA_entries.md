Here is my review on the new Decamove from Deca. This is a hip tracker for PC virtual reality systems that changes the way you move fundamentally within VR. So far I have had a very positive experience with the Decamove and I am definitely looking forward to seeing what else comes from the company. I know they have a VR headset and a wireless adapter on the way, this was the first taste of what Deca has.. and I'm pretty happy with it.
