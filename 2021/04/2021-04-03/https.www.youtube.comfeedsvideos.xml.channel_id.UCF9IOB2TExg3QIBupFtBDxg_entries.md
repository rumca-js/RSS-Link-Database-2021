Domestic Travel During COVID-19 (CDC, 2nd April)

https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/04/02/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html

CDC recommends delaying travel until fully vaccinated

Fully vaccinated travellers are less likely to get and spread COVID-19.

People who are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized vaccine can travel safely within the United States:

Fully vaccinated travellers do not need to get tested before or after travel unless their destination requires it

Fully vaccinated travellers do not need to self-quarantine

Fully vaccinated travellers should still follow CDC’s recommendations for traveling safely including:

Wear a mask over your nose and mouth

Stay 6 feet from others and avoid crowds

Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer

After, self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms

Isolate and get tested if you develop symptoms

Fully vaccinated means

Two weeks after a second dose of Pfizer or Moderna

Two weeks after a single dose Janssen

It’s spreading far more quickly than it was before, and we cannot vaccinate quickly enough to break this third wave

This is my new trailer video for the channel. No need to watch if you are a regular viewer.
Just a note about ads on these videos. I normally put an ad at the beginning of my videos, and sometimes at the end as well. This is essential to generate some funds for the channel and my educational projects. However, I never put ads in the body of the video, no matter how long it is. This means that once you have started to watch the video, you can watch the whole thing without any interuptions.
