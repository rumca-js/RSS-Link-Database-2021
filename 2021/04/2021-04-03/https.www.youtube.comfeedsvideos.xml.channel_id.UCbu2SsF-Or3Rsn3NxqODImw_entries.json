For the most part, the loot shooter/RPG hybrid is pretty straightforward, but a few of its mechanics and systems could use a bit more clarification.\n\nIn the video above, Jordan Ram\u00e9e details 10 tips for how to be a better Outrider in Outriders. Some of the advice is geared towards ensuring you're always finding the best loot, whether that's from chests hidden throughout the planet of Enoch or from World Tier rewards. Other tips should help you make Outriders a bit more approachable in terms of difficulty--if you take the time to understand how crafting and modding works, as well as when to raise and lower your World Tier, you'll have a much easier time making it through the game.\n\nOutriders has managed a rather popular launch despite the assortment of server issues that are pretty much an expected part of the experience for any brand-new, online-only game at this point. So far, we've been enjoying it too.\n\nIn GameSpot's Outriders review, Phil Hornshaw wrote, \"[Outriders'] story is often funny but similarly intense; its combat requires you to take cover and to charge; its abilities make you phenomenally powerful but prone to overestimating yourself.
