UK, 12th April, Next stage in roadmap

Prof Graham Medley, Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies

Eventual indoor, highly likely resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths

It really just depends upon the impact of vaccination, particularly on transmission, so whether or not people can get infected and pass the virus on. 

And we just don't know that

The only thing we can be sure of is that we don't know exactly what is going to happen

but we do know that, because the vaccine isn't 100% effective, there will be some transmission, 

and there will be some breakthrough of immunity." 

Face space after 21 June?

Excess Deaths From COVID-19 and Other Causes
in the US, March 1, 2020, to January 2, 202

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778361

District of Columbia and 49 states, (North Carolina, insufficient data)

Total US deaths, 2,801,439 deaths

22.9% more than expected

Representing 522 368 excess deaths

(CoViD US official deaths 5th April = 553,681)

Deaths attributed to COVID-19 accounted for 72.4% of US excess deaths

The excess death rate was higher among

Non-Hispanic Black, 208.4 deaths per 100,000

Non-Hispanic White, 157 per 100,000

Hispanic populations, 139.8 per 100 000

Learning from Excess Pandemic Deaths

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778362

Individual present-centeredness is mirrored in the larger society

Morbidity may be responsible for as much as 40% of the health costs of COVID-19

Corresponding economic loss—estimated as high as $16 trillion in the US

90% of the gross domestic product

This indicates potential savings in preparing for the next pandemic

The US and other countries are most likely to learn from the pandemic if they understand the consequences of failure

1918 populations

Global, 1.8 billion (2.7%)

US, 103 million

UK, 42 million
