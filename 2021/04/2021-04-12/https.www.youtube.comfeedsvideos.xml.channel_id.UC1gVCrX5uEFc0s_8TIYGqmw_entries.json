The women stand together and the woman holding the umbrella puts an ear piece against her ear.  M/S of a woman at a telephone exchange holding a microphone or stick telephone.  She speaks then turns around to a wind up gramophone.  She winds it, places the needle on the record and holds the microphone or mouthpiece to the record.  The two women smile and chat - they are listening to the record presumably.  An early mobile phone crossed with an early Sony walkman!  Excellent! \n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://www.britishpathe.com/video/eves-wireless/query/99816\n\ud83d\udd17 https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/radio31_home_o_fone.html\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
