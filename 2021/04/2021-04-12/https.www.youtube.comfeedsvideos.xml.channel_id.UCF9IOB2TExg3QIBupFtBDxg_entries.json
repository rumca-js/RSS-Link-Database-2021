of infections\n\nProphylactic treatment can be given with two doses of 0.2mg/kg, 48 hours apart, once a month. \n\nFor early out-patient treatment, a daily dose of 0.2mg/kg for a maximum of five days is recommended\n\nIn the UK, the best way forward would be for the MHRA to authorise use of ivermectin for prophylaxis and treatment of Covid-19 on the basis of the published evidence to date. \n\nNext, the drug could be made available through community pharmacies either using a PGD or by making ivermectin a P medicine\n\nIvermectin would then help to save lives and reduce suffering until the majority of the population can be vaccinated\n\nFailure to use a cheap, safe drug that reduces the severity and duration of infection as well as the risks of death and transmission seems
