If you know one thing about mosquitoes, it’s probably their lust for blood. But there’s actually one species that almost never bites, even though it can. Could finding out why help us combat blood-borne diseases?

When you hear the words dire wolf, your mind might jump to Game of Thrones or Dungeons and Dragons, but dire wolves are not just in the realm of fantasy and fiction. They were real animals that lived during the last Ice Age, and we're still learning a lot about them, like the fact that they aren't wolves!
