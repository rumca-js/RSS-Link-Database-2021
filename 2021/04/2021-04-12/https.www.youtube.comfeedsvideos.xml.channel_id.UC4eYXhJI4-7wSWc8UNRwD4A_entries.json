Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | April 12, 2021\nNathaniel Rateliff\u00a0stands in an old familiar place, sharing his pain. The Mercury Caf\u00e9 is one of the first places Nathaniel frequented when he moved to Denver in 1998, hearing jazz, dancing, and eventually playing many shows there. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he's assembled a dozen players including a string section, backing singers, and some of his oldest friends: Joseph Pope III on bass, Mark Shusterman on keys, Luke Mossman on guitar and Patrick Meese on drums. On the opening song and the title track to his 2020 album,\u00a0And It's Still Alright,\u00a0they're restrained as Nathaniel sings about loss, including his friend and producer\u00a0Richard Swift, but he's holding on. \"I'll be damned if this old man / Don't start to counting his losses / But it's still alright.\"\nBut restraint lets loose on the chorus of \"Redemption,\" a song about breaking free of the past and written for Apple original film\u00a0Palmer, starring\u00a0Justin Timberlake. The ender, a tune called \"Mavis,\" truly is a grand finale, a song that conjures up images of\u00a0The Band\u00a0singing\u00a0Bob Dylan's \"I Shall Be Released\" \u2014 and what a fabulous release it is.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"And It's Still Alright\"\n \u2022 \"All Or Nothing\"\n \u2022 \"Redemption\"\n \u2022 \"Mavis\"\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Nathaniel Rateliff: guitar, vocals\n \u2022 Patrick Meese: drums, keys\n \u2022 Joseph Pope III: bass\n \u2022 Mark Shusterman: keys\n \u2022 Luke Mossman: guitar\n \u2022 James Barone: drums, guitar\n \u2022 Chris Jusell: violin\n \u2022 Joy Adams: cello\n \u2022 Adrienne Short: violin\n \u2022 Rachel Sliker: viola\n \u2022 Larea Edwards: vocals\n \u2022 Chrissy Grant: vocals\n \u2022 Kinnie Maveryck: vocals\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Rett Rogers, Jasper Gray, Frank Pickell, Will Gardner, Hillary Thomas, Trevor McKenna, Christian Silberbauer, Sam Sigler\n \u2022 Audio: Patrick Meese, James Mefford\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Bob Boilen\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #nathanielrateliff", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3p7JxooncM", "date_published": "2021-04-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
