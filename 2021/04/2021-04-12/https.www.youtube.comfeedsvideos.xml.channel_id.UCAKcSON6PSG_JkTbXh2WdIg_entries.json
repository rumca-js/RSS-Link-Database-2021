Here's a session by Low recorded back in September 2015, just days after the release of their 11th album, \"Ones and Sixes.\"\n\nLow have played together since 1993, but frontman Alan Sparkhawk has a simple formula for the way the band members have sustained their passion and creativity for more than two decades. \"Luckily we've always been pretty na\u00efve,\" Sparhawk said, \"and [we] didn't really know what we're doing and always felt like we're learning.\"\n\nFor \"Ones and Sixes,\" Low recorded at Justin Vernon's April Base studio in Eau Claire, Wis., and worked with producer and engineer BJ Burton. \"We've bveen able to work with a lot of great people,\" Sparhawk said. \"That, in a lot of ways, is sort of a key. You kind of always need to find a new way, a new filter to try to see what you do will end up being.\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"What Part of Me\"\n3:09 \"No Comprende\"\n8:13 \"DJ\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nAlan Sparhawk \u2013 guitar, vocals\nMimi Parker \u2013 drums, vocals\nSteve Garrington \u2013 bass\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2007 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2007/03/30/low\n2011 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/04/15/-low-in-the-current-studio\n2013 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/03/28/low-live\n2015 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/09/18/low-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2015 Alan Sparhawk of Low, Guitar Collection interview:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/09/23/the-current-s-guitar-collection-low-s-alan-sparhawk-danelectro-convertible\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#low #lowtheband", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM8D8RlrfGY", "date_published": "2021-04-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "St. Vincent talks about 'Daddy's Home,' and SNL", "description": "St. Vincent's Annie Clark connects with Jade to talk about her upcoming album Daddy's Home, the visual representations that have accompanied the eras of her discography, and putting together the band for her recent Saturday Night Live performance.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent\n\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\u200b\u200b\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jSl44JmPZU", "date_published": "2021-04-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Judith Hill - Burn It All (live performance)", "description": "Watch @JudithHillMusic perform her 2021 track, \"Burn It All,\" from her latest record 'Baby, I'm Hollywood!'
