Covering the lands of Middle-earth during the Second Age, region by region.  With Beleriand sunk into the sea, the world is changed.  The elves create new realms for themselves, while the men of the First Age are given the island of Númenor by the Valar.  As the Second Age begins and a new Dark Lord rises, alliances and enemies are made that will shape the world for ages to come.
