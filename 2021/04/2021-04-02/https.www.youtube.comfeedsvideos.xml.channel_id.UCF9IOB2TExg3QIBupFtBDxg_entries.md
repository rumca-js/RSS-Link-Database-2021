Domestic Travel During COVID-19 (CDC, 2nd April)

https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/04/02/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html

CDC recommends delaying travel until fully vaccinated

Fully vaccinated travellers are less likely to get and spread COVID-19.

People who are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized vaccine can travel safely within the United States:

Fully vaccinated travellers do not need to get tested before or after travel unless their destination requires it

Fully vaccinated travellers do not need to self-quarantine

Fully vaccinated travellers should still follow CDC’s recommendations for traveling safely including:

Wear a mask over your nose and mouth

Stay 6 feet from others and avoid crowds

Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer

After, self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms

Isolate and get tested if you develop symptoms

Fully vaccinated means

Two weeks after a second dose of Pfizer or Moderna

Two weeks after a single dose Janssen

As the new variants spread, you will see that covid-19 is killing faster and younger

It’s spreading far more quickly than it was before, and we cannot vaccinate quickly enough to break this third wave

This is my new trailer video for the channel. No need to watch if you are a regular viewer.
Just a note about ads on these videos. I normally put an ad at the beginning of my videos, and sometimes at the end as well. This is essential to generate some funds for the channel and my educational projects. However, I never put ads in the body of the video, no matter how long it is. This means that once you have started to watch the video, you can watch the whole thing without any interuptions.

Britain learns to treat coronavirus like flu

Prof Chris Whitty

Up to 25,000 people die in a bad flu year without anyone noticing, 2017 -2018

Every year, somewhere between 7,000 and 9,000 citizens die of flu

most of them very elderly

Accepting some Covid deaths, the price of a whole life

Royal School of Medicine webinar

Government, pull the alarm cord because of dangerous now VOC

Covid is not going to go away

You've got to work out what's a rational policy to this and here I would differentiate quite a lot between a 
pandemic environment and what you get with seasonal flu

So it is clear we are going to have to manage it, at some point, rather like we manage the flu. 

Here is a seasonal, very dangerous disease that kills thousands of people and society has chosen a particular way round it.

Society would not tolerate lock down to prevent flu type numbers

We want to get as close as we can [to zero] but the question is how do you balance that against other priorities?

What are people prepared to put up with

Flu appears to be optional

We need to work out some balance which actually keeps it at a low level, 

minimises deaths as best we can, but in a way that the population tolerates, 

through medical countermeasures like vaccines 

and in due course drugs, 

which mean you can minimise mortality while not maximising the economic and social impacts on our fellow citizens

Lockdowns would be reimposed if cases rose? No, I don't think so

Impossible to prevent variants from coming into the UK

We have to accept the idea that stopping variants coming to the UK is not a realistic starting point,

but you can slow it down
