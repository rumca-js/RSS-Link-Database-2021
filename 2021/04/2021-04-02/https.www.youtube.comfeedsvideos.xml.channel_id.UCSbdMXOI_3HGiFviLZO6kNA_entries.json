This is a hip tracker for PC virtual reality systems that changes the way you move fundamentally within VR. So far I have had a very positive experience with the Decamove and I am definitely looking forward to seeing what else comes from the company. I know they have a VR headset and a wireless adapter on the way, this was the first taste of what Deca has.. and I'm pretty happy with it. \n\nMy links-\nTwitch Stream TODAY!\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nJoin my discord for good times\nhttps://discord.gg/thrill\nPatreon link:Join\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\nGAMERSUPPS Discount Code: THRILL\nhttp://gamersupps.gg/?afmc=thrill\n\n\nDecagear links-\nhttps://www.deca.net/decagear/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URhBdzHylm4", "date_published": "2021-04-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
