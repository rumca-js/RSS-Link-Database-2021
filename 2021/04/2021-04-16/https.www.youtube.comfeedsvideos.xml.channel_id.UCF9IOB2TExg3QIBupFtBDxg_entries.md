E mail from CDC to CNN, Breakthrough infections

https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/949381?src=wnl_edit_tpal&uac=127834AR&impID=3316056&faf=1

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/14/health/breakthrough-infections-covid-vaccines-cdc/index.html

Vaccinated people who become infected = 5,800

About 1 in 13,275

At least 14 days after their final dose

Asymptomatic, 29%

Required hospitalization = 396 (1 in 194,444)

Deaths = 74 (1 in 1,040,540)

CDC currently investigating factors

May be more cases to report due to reporting lag

From 77 million fully vaccinated

(Fully vaccinated as of today = 80.6 million)

From trials

Pfizer/BioNTech, 95% effective in preventing symptomatic disease

Moderna, 94% effective in preventing symptomatic illness

Johnson & Johnson, 72% from US data

Characteristics of breakthroughs so far

40% of the infections were in people 60 or more

65%, were female

CDC is monitoring reported cases for clustering by patient demographics, geographic location, time since vaccination, vaccine type or lot number, and SARS-CoV-2 lineage

CDC also continues to recommend people who have been fully vaccinated should keep taking precautions in public places, like wearing a mask, staying at least six feet apart from others, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and washing their hands often

Dr. Carlos del Rio, Emory University School of Medicine

Less transmission means fewer breakthrough cases

There is currently a lot of transmission in many parts of the country

Vaccines will help decrease that

Get vaccinated as soon as you can and help control this pandemic

National Institutes of Health Director Dr Francis Collins

Allow more time for scientists to investigate links between the vaccine and blood clots

and whether or not certain groups of people are more susceptible

India, double mutation variant emerge

Hey john thanks for the update. I am from Delhi, India and I have contracted the virus. Situation in India is very bad. Most of the hospitals are already exhausted and many people are dying without treatment.

 The India variant, B.1.617

E484Q and L452R

First reported in India, late 2020

Aparna Mukherjee, Indian Council of Medical Research

has not been stamped as a ‘variant of concern’ so as to say that it is more lethal or more infectious

But

https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/resources/outbreak-tracker

Very low prevalence in January

April, 52% of samples sequenced

Maharashtra state, 60%

Has been detected in 10 other countries, US, UK (77 cases) Australia and New Zealand

(L452 from US data, 20% more transmissible, reduces antibody efficacy by more 50%)

William A. Haseltine, former professor, Harvard Medical School

The B.1.617 variant has all the hallmarks of a very dangerous virus

We must do all that is possible to identify its spread and to contain it

Brazil

https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/04/16/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/

Trying to get more drugs from Spain

Rio de Janeiro, health-care workers forced to intubate patients without sedatives

Mechanical restraints and neuromuscular blockers

Doctors Without Borders

More than 12 months into Brazil’s covid-19 emergency, there is still no effective, centralized and coordinated public health response to the outbreak

The lack of political will to adequately respond to the pandemic is killing Brazilians in their thousands

India

Cases, + 216,850

Deaths, + 1,183 = 174,308

Vaccinations, 117,223,509

Infection drivers

Workplaces

Markets and malls have reopened

Transport operating at full capacity

Big weddings

Festivals

Election rallies

Probable new variants

Population 9.3 million


US and UK vaccination rates 

 UK, 48% of overall population

I guess the difference won't bother most news consumers much but I'd like to think your viewers might be more discerning, (Tony)

Cerebral venous thrombosis: a retrospective cohort study of 513,284 confirmed COVID -19 cases and a comparison with 489,871 people receiving a COVID -19 mRNA vaccine

Can help contextualize the risks and benefits of vaccination in this regard

https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-15-risk-rare-blood-clotting-higher-covid-19-vaccines

https://osf.io/a9jdq/

Using an electronic health records network

Absolute incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in the two weeks following:

(Incidence of portal vein thrombosis, PVT also assessed)

COVID-19 diagnosis (N=513,284)

Influenza (N=172,742)

Receipt of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines (N=489,871)

The incidence of CVT after COVID-19 diagnosis

CVT = 39.0 per million people

The incidence of CVT after influenza diagnosis

CVT = Zero per million people

Incidence of CVT after receiving BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine

CVT = 4.1 per million people

The incidence of PVT after COVID-19 diagnosis

PVT = 436

The incidence of PVT after influenza diagnosis

PVT = 98

Incidence of PVT after receiving BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine

PVT = 44 per million

CVT incidence observed across the entire health records network

0.41 per million people over any 2-week period

Laboratory test results, available in a subset of the COVID-19 patients, suggestive of:

Raised D-dimer, lowered fibrinogen, and an increased rate of thrombocytopenia in the CVT and PVT groups

CVT Mortality = 20% in 2 weeks after CoViD
PVT mortality = 18.8% in 2 weeks after CoViD

Latest estimate from the European Medicines Agency

Incidence associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine 

CVT = 5.0 per million people

Splanchnic thrombosis by the EMA following vaccination with ChAdOx1

(portal, splenic, mesenteric)

53 cases out of 34 million people

1.6 per million people
