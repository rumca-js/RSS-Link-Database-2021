And while we\u2019re all a little busy fetishizing the tall vampire lady, what do we actually know about her?\n\nCheck out our complete Resident Evil timeline explained here: https://youtu.be/QkPgowr-T9g\u200b \n\nWe\u2019re only a few weeks away from the release of Resident Evil Village, but we still can\u2019t seem to stop talking about the internet\u2019s most notoriously tall vampire woman: Lady Alcina Dimitrescu. We\u2019re all still very thirsty to know as much as possible about her, and thanks to the recent RE Village showcase we have a little more information on the tall lady--just enough to hold us over.\u00a0\n\nIn the above video, Kurt Indovina fulfills everyone\u2019s stalkier desires, and uncovers everything we know so far about the Romanian vampire, Lady Dimitrescu. Kurt goes over her obvious height, being a vampire, and art director Tomonori Takano's inspirations, which include Morticia Adams and Hungarian noblewoman/serial killer Elizabeth B\u00e1thory. Carrying over from Resident Evil 7, there\u2019s a returning motif of antagonistic family. Dimitrescu mentions Mother Miranda, her daughters, and a brother named Heisenberg.\u00a0\n\nResident Evil Village is very much a\u00a0 continuation of the previous installment, carrying over RE7's first-person view and protagonist Ethan Winters, while taking direct inspiration from Resident Evil 4\u2019s more gothic,and European influence. Still, there are many questions left unanswered, like whether or not Dimitrescu is actually the main antagonist, and why is Ethan\u2019s child so important?\u00a0\n\nHopefully our dreams will be made true on May 7.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdGss8-va64", "date_published": "2021-04-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Genshin Impact 6 Months Later: Is It Still Good?", "description": "How is Genshin Impact after 6 months of not playing the game? We take a quick look and see if it still holds up since its September launch.\n\nGenshin Impact is a massive game that, on its initial launch, was truly magical. But I think we won't be alone here to say that most people had a honeymoon phase, and the end game became the crossroads for many players. But six months later, picking up Genshin Impact again turned out to be an interesting experience because of a unique combination of traits this game has that we never thought about.\n\nWhat has changed in Genshin Impact? What's been added? And how is it for returning players? We go over what we think while playing on the newest update.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJbRsxoANo", "date_published": "2021-04-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
