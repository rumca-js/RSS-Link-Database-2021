Welcome to my School Friendly Climate Change Video!

So. What is Climate Change? Do you know the facts? No?

Well I personally had no idea. One day it just hit me, I knew very little about climate change. Even with a useless degree in chemistry, climate change is a confusing mess of strange and difficult to understand information.

I made this video to gather all the facts I could find about climate change, in a fun way, and without any bias on my part. I wanted anyone who watched this video (and myself too!) to understand all the important facts relating to climate change. Non-scientists welcome. 

Science is exciting! It’s just school and most of our education systems aren’t…

In a few months this video will be uploaded as to remove any language or scenes not suitable for schools, so it can be used to teach about climate change in schools.
