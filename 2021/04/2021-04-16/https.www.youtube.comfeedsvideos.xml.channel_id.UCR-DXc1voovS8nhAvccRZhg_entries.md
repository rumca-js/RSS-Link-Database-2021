The MirkoPC is a full-featured Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4-based PC board.

It makes the experience of running a Pi as a daily computer much better, with features like a built-in full-size M.2 slot for fast NVMe storage, and a high-quality headphone amplifier.

This video goes over all the details, and also highlights one of the things I like most about MirkoPCâ€”it was designed by one person, Mirek, from Poland!
