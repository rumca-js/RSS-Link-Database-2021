We got our first look at gameplay and have a clearer picture of the game\u2019s plot as well as some of its villains.\n\nIn this video, Jean-Luc breaks down all the important details you need to know about Village. When is it coming out? How does this tie into Resident Evil 7? And what's the deal with that tall vampire lady that keeps showing up on my social media feed? All of these questions and more are answered.\n\nCapcom also released the PS5 exclusive Maiden demo, which acts as a visual showcase for Village. If you don\u2019t own a PS5 and would like to see the demo for yourself, we captured the whole thing and you can watch it right here on our YouTube channel. Make sure to come back to GameSpot for more Resident Evil Village coverage as we get closer to the game\u2019s May 7th release for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC as well as PS4 and Xbox One.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmoMVJIeAao", "date_published": "2021-01-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Super Mario 3D World: Switch vs. Wii U Comparison", "description": "With Super Mario 3D World headed to Nintendo Switch, we put it head-to-head with the original Wii U version to see the differences.\n\nSuper Mario 3D World + Bowser\u2019s Fury continues Nintendo\u2019s trend of taking some of the biggest and best games from the Wii U generation and bringing it back to the much more popular Switch platform. But while this is a re-release of an eight-year-old game, it\u2019s not without some neat quality-of-life improvements, which we showcase in this video.\u00a0\n\nThe most obvious change when viewing the games side-by-side is that character speeds have been greatly increased, both in the overworld map and inside stages themselves. You could always hold Y to dash, but now all the characters move significantly faster. This has the added effect of making Toad a much more tricky risk-reward character, since his dash was always significantly faster than other characters, and now he\u2019s just blazing-fast. It also makes moving around the map to choose your next stage move at a speedier clip.\u00a0\n\nThe Switch version is also just more visually attractive. While the fidelity and textures look very similar, the icons have been shrunk to take less screen real estate, and the text boxes have been lightened to let you see the game world more clearly.\u00a0\n\nAnd, of course, the strange microphone-blowing mechanic to move platforms has been changed so that platforms now move automatically. That odd holdover just doesn\u2019t belong on the Switch version.\n\nBut while the game packs plenty of changes, it\u2019s still the core game at heart. Super Mario 3D World is a rousing platforming adventure with co-op featuring four characters with relatively different power sets. Mario is the all-arounder, Luigi has his fluttery high-jump, Peach can float, and as mentioned, Toad is a little speedster. Finding your rhythm through this series of platforming stages as one of the characters is as engaging as it ever was, and now you can do it via online co-op play.\n\nWhile Super Mario 3D World is the major re-release, it\u2019s also only half of the package. The other part, Bowser\u2019s Fury, is its own distinct game that marries parts of Super Mario Odyssey\u2019s open-world design with power-ups and elements from 3D World. Rather than complete a series of distinct stages, you\u2019ll be collecting new \u201cCat Shines\u201d in a vast island environment and intermittently escaping the rage of Fury Bowser. Or even growing huge to battle him face-to-face. This new game is unlike either Mario Odyssey or 3D World. We\u2019ll be showing and talking more about it and the package as a whole in the coming days with our review and launch coverage.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2H511E96Eg", "date_published": "2021-01-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Medium Review", "description": "The Medium is a terrifying but compelling exploration of duality, one that uses the horror of personal trauma to craft a memorable tale.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuxMRbSWwAg", "date_published": "2021-01-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "This Cyberpunk 2077 Mod Adds Free Respecs and New Game Plus", "description": "The Respector mod lets you reset your attributes and perk points in CD Projekt Red's latest RPG.\n\nThe Cyberpunk 2077 community is quickly developing new content and handy tweaks for all sorts of things in the game, adding fresh elements to the game, changing the look of Night City, and introducing some useful quality-of-life adjustments.
