Good ol' boy, born outside of Lubbock, Texas. The documentary really goes deep into all those Keys played with, which is astonishing, because his tone and the way he played is so singular, that you can pull it out of almost any recording.\n\nMost prevalent in Keys' career is his time with the Rolling Stones. Keys is lauded by Charlie Watts, and was great friend with Keith Richards. Keys is as much a part of that band as any of them, and even Keith says Keys might be considered the fifth Rolling Stone.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx10e5DT180", "date_published": "2021-01-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
