this video is pre-recorded before the events today with Swag Academy.  For those of you who don't know I was harassed blackmailed and libel'd for the last year. I'm getting my story together right now and I WILL be responding.

this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.

*HUGE DISCLAIMER* I do NOT own any gamestop stock (although I wish I had bought in early), but I DO NOT advise it now or ever. This is a meme tribute to all the idiots over at r/wallstreetbets. I REPEAT, do NOT buy GameStop unless you are prepared to lose 100% of the money. Itâ€™s straight up gambling at this point.

I"M NEVER SELLING. DAN LOK'S HOUSE IS MINE AND I'M KEEPING IT! DAN LOK literally could offer me millions of $$$ and I would refuse. 

A REVIEW OF EARTH 2
VERDICT ON Earth2.io 
This is NOT an investment. MOST people will NOT make their money back and you should look at it as an investment into an extremely RISKY idea with no alpha and a young development team.
