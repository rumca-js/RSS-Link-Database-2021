Three years ago, Anderson East's album, "Encore," was our Album of the Week. Four months before the release of that record, East and his bandmates visited The Current studio to play a few songs they had been road-testing for that album. But two years prior to that, Anderson East visited our studio on his own to play songs from his 2015 album, "Delilah." Watch two songs from that session. 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Devil In Me"
4:02 "Satisfy Me"

## Listen to Looch: the story of Rolling Stones sax player Bobby Keys
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx10e5DT180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx10e5DT180)

If you're like Mary Lucia and love the Rolling Stones, then Mary has a documentary for you: "Every Night's a Saturday Night," that is about the legendary saxophone player, Bobby Keys. Good ol' boy, born outside of Lubbock, Texas. The documentary really goes deep into all those Keys played with, which is astonishing, because his tone and the way he played is so singular, that you can pull it out of almost any recording.

Most prevalent in Keys' career is his time with the Rolling Stones. Keys is lauded by Charlie Watts, and was great friend with Keith Richards. Keys is as much a part of that band as any of them, and even Keith says Keys might be considered the fifth Rolling Stone.
