<p>The Booker-winning author on what Russian short stories can teach us, late-life realisations and why he doesn’t like social media</p><p>George Saunders was born in Texas in 1958 and raised in Illinois. Before his first novel, <em>Lincoln in the Bardo,</em> won the 2017 Booker prize, he was best known as a writer of short stories, publishing four collections since 1996 and winning a slew of awards. In 2006, he was awarded both a Guggenheim and a MacArthur fellowship. His latest book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain-9781526624284.html">A Swim in a Pond in the Rain</a></em>, draws on two decades of teaching a creative writing class on the Russian short story in translation at Syracuse University, where he is a professor. Saunders lives in California but was in the middle of a snowstorm in upstate New York when this interview took place via Zoom.</p><p><strong>What prompted you to turn your creative writing class into a book?<br /></strong>I was on the road for a long time with <em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em>. When I came back to teaching, I just thought, man, after 20 years of this, I really know a lot about these stories. There was also that late-life realisation that if I go, all that knowledge goes too. I thought it would be just a matter of typing up the notes, but of course it turned out to be a lot more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/02/george-saunders-these-trenches-were-in-are-so-deep">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The streaming giants are making bold TV shows but the threat of censorship looms large</p><p>This year’s Emmy awards, one of the biggest nights in global television, was particularly historic for India.

Over the past two years, streaming has radically shifted India’s domestic creative landscape – and created a new global audience for Indian series and films. According to Amazon Prime, 20% of viewers of their original Indian content are now from outside India.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/02/in-the-land-of-storytelling-netflix-and-amazon-prime-reshape-indias-creative-landscape">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Those practices supposed to reduce egoism often encourage feelings of pious superiority</p><p>It would appear that the mindfulness movement is overrun by preening narcissists. Who could have guessed? A Dutch <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2721">study by Roos Vonk and Anouk Visser</a>, entitled An Exploration of Spiritual Superiority: The Paradox of Self-Enhancement, is the first to measure how people feel they’re more advanced than others in terms of wisdom, self-knowledge and psychic intuition.</p><p>An investigation involving around 3,700 people found that practices that are supposed to minimise the ego tend to enlarge it and that those who put extra effort into enhancing spirituality – mindfulness retreats, aura-reading, past life-regression – are the smuggest, most self-aggrandising and unbearable of all (I may be paraphrasing a tad there). Such people cling to unmeasurable and irrefutable claims about their innate superiority, such as greater insights into the human condition, deeper compassion for others and more advanced psychic abilities (they <em>sense</em> things, dontcha know!). Most of us will have come across people like this. Roughly 99% will wish that we hadn’t.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/02/spirituality-is-all-very-well-but-dont-let-it-turn-you-into-a-smug-monster">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hull-based artist <a href="http://instagram.com/carry_a_bag_man">Aaron Thompson’s Instagram project Carry a Bag Man</a> is a trip down memory lane. He first began collecting vintage carrier bags a few years ago, along with other packaging such as chocolate wrappers and crisp packets. It all started when he found an old Kwik Save bag in a shed. “I work in garden maintenance, so every time I had to take sheds or outhouses down, I’d come across bags.” So far, he’s photographed more than 250 for Instagram, from shops such as WH Smith, Topshop and HMV. Many of them are likely to bring back fond memories of the shopping sprees in January sales from years gone by. “The effort put into advertising back then was so much more creative and out-there,” he says. “It’s great to look at a bag and get that burst of nostalgia as soon as you see a design you’ve totally forgotten about.” </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2021/jan/02/plastic-fantastic-vintage-carrier-bags-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The tech giants’ law-free bonanza is coming to an end on both sides of the Atlantic, but let’s speed up the process </p><p>It’s always risky making predictions about the tech industry, but this year looks like being different, at least in the sense that there are two safe bets. One is that the attempts to regulate the tech giants that began last year will intensify; the second that we will be increasingly deluged by sanctimonious cant from Facebook &amp; co as they seek to avoid democratic curbing of their unaccountable power.</p><p>On the regulation front, last year in the US, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/google-parent-company-alphabet-expected-reach-1-trillion-value">Alphabet</a>, Google’s corporate owner, found itself facing major antitrust suits from <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/12/17/google-faces-antitrust-lawsuit-38-states-over-search/3943665001/">38 states</a> as well as from the Department of Justice.

Instead, the unit will decide on a case-by-case basis whether a particular tech company has “strategic market status” if it possesses “substantial, entrenched market power in at least one digital activity” or if it acts as an online “gateway” for other businesses. And if a company is judged to have this status, then penalties and regulations will be imposed on it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/02/all-i-want-for-2021-is-to-see-mark-zuckerberg-up-in-court">Continue reading...</a>

There’s also a vast open-plan central London office, easy camaraderie with staff, lots of plants. He has the enthusiasm and world-changing idealism too. With all these markers of a tech unicorn – a deal last month with Tokyo Gas <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/23/uk-octopus-energy-japan-tokyo-gas" title="">valued it at $2bn</a> (£1.5bn) – it’s easy to forget that Octopus is an energy company. Jackson, 49, says the distinction is increasingly irrelevant.</p><p>Octopus is a new breed of energy supplier, built on cutting-edge technology and unencumbered by the creaking billing systems and fossil-fuel plants that plague the UK’s “big six”. Set up just five years ago, it has been free to view the energy market as a tech startup would: ripe for disruption. This has made Octopus <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/05/tech-unicorn-octopus-energy-to-create-1000-new-uk-jobs" title="">Britain’s fastest-growing energy supplier</a>, and helped it agree that Japanese deal – under which it will supply energy to homes in Japan, while Tokyo Gas takes a near-10% stake in Octopus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/02/energy-needed-a-digital-revolution-and-we-are-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government likes to think the public can’t be trusted – but Britain’s experience in 2020 shows the reverse is true</p><p>I have worked as a psychologist for over 40 years, but Covid-19 has projected the analysis of human behaviour into public discourse in a way I have never before witnessed. The spread of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease Covid-19, depends upon physical proximity between people. Consequently, fighting the infection means changing fundamental aspects of our everyday routines. We have all been challenged to reduce the social contacts and intimacies that we so cherish as social animals.</p><p>Covid has done much to further the study of behaviour by bringing it into people’s homes and day-to-day conversations. In countless radio phone-ins and television news programmes, magazine articles and newspaper reports, discussions of the bases of adherence and resistance to Covid regulations have become commonplace.

But, last year, there was something uncanny about seeing conspiracist attitudes usually reserved for the screen – comment sections, forums, chat boxes on Facebook and on any trending hashtag on Twitter or Instagram – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/24/london-braces-for-fourth-protest-against-covid-19-restrictions">spilling over into the physical world</a> in the form of protests, both individual and collective.</p><p>We’re all familiar to an extent with the Covid-sceptic worldview: one that stretches from claims that the pandemic itself is a “hoax” to the notion that the vaccine rollout is part of a sinister plot by world governments. This, coupled with a number of rightwing commentators in the US and the UK downplaying the threat of Covid-19 to hundreds of thousands of followers, meant that 2020 wasn’t just about navigating a major global health crisis – for many people, it was about partaking in a culture war premised on notions of freedom.

<p>Covid denied her a proper funeral, so it meant a lot to see the love for her from Lin-Manuel Miranda, Kristen Schaal and others</p><p>My cousin Catie Lazarus died last month. She was 44. No, not from Covid – the other big C, which, it turns out, does not take a break even during a pandemic. One of Catie’s and my running jokes was about how Jewish we both look: “We’re like a Nazi propaganda poster,” she said, catching our reflection in her bathroom mirror when I stayed with her in 2014, just after she started chemotherapy. So I like to think she would have got a kick out of the fact that she died in the middle of Hanukah. Although she would have then joked that she wasn’t sure if that made her a good Jew or a very bad one.</p><p>Covid denied her a proper funeral, so it meant a lot to Catie’s family to see all the love for her on social media, from people including <a href="https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/1338643525915832323?s=20" title="">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kristenschaaled/status/1338677872236617728?s=20" title="">Kristen Schaal</a>.

She was a lot of things – a writer, a comedian, a podcaster – and underpinning them all, she was just funny. God, she was funny. Whether she was on stage or just chatting with me, she would throw out funny asides like a catherine wheel spitting sparks. But she always laughed hardest – a big, open-mouthed laugh – at other people’s (less funny) jokes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/02/my-naughty-cousin-catie-lazarus-was-the-funniest-woman-in-any-room-how-ill-miss-her">Continue reading...</a>

It was planted by his father, before Afonso Reis was born. He worked as a driver and “liked trees”, says Reis, who is in his 70s.

Others hawk bananas, oranges, secondhand clothes. Life would change but the tree seemed constant. Then something odd happened. At about 2pm on 14 March 2019, the tree suddenly keeled over and crashed to the ground. No one was hurt, but people were taken by surprise. “There was only a light wind,” Fina says. “Who would have thought that a tree that size would just fall down?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/02/the-sea-is-rising-the-climate-is-changing-the-lessons-learned-from-mozambiques-deadly-cyclone">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From starring opposite Hugh Grant aged 11 to joining the X-Men, does nothing faze the actor? Well, there was one scene for his latest role ...</p><p>Preparing for his role as Emperor Peter III of Russia in the TV show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/13/the-great-review-hulu-elle-fanning" title="">The Great</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/nicholas-hoult" title="">Nicholas Hoult</a> wondered if he should go for the accent. The 31-year-old had just finished filming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/10/the-current-war-review-benedict-cumberbatch-edison-toronto-film-festival-2017-tiff" title="">The Current War</a>, a movie in which he played the inventor Nikola Tesla, and it struck him he could, without too much effort, repurpose his Serbian into a passable Russian. Hoult is thoughtful, conscientious, and takes his job very seriously. “It didn’t flow in the right way,” he says, of his stab at Russian, and back he went to the drawing board, specifically to an exaggerated version of his own accent. “I don’t go the full public schoolboy, but I’m very posh – educated but childish.” A new comic antihero was born.</p><p>Hoult is in London with his girlfriend Bryana Holly, an American model, and their two-year-old son Joaquin, in the midst of filming season two of The Great. It’s a terrific show, written by Tony McNamara – who also penned the Oscar-winning movie <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-yorgos-lanthimos" title="">The Favourite</a>, in which Hoult appeared alongside <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/olivia-colman" title="">Olivia Colman</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-stone" title="">Emma Stone</a> – and co-starring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/elle-fanning" title="">Elle Fanning</a> as Catherine the Great. It’s riotously entertaining, and Hoult, as Peter III, is spoilt, impulsive, infantile and profane, a figure who will summarily execute or pardon on a whim. It is also very funny. Despite being a period piece, there is a vibe of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-thick-of-it" title="">The Thick Of It</a>, mainly because of the amazing levels of swearing and Hoult’s indignant tyranny. His catchphrase – “huzzah!” – is the most benign thing about him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/02/nicholas-hoult-part-of-your-brain-doesnt-want-to-walk-down-a-corridor-naked">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve had more lipstick-free days this year than over the previous three decades. But these products proved indispensable</p><p>At the beginning of each year, I share my most used and loved products of the past 12 months – and this time the task is very different. I can’t pick a lipstick because I’ve had more lipstick-free days in 2020 than over the previous three decades. Foundation was another thing I left aside, except for high days and holidays, as I was either in pyjamas inside or a mask outside.</p><p>Skincare, though, channelled our greater need for self-care, and used up newfound free time. And for me, some products still proved indispensable in this most freakish, high-anxiety, low-maintenance of years. At the time of writing, I have used <a href="https://www.skinandme.com/" title=""><strong>Skin+Me’s prescription cream</strong></a> every night for almost four months – a personal record for someone who must frequently abandon beloved products in the name of testing the next. I answered a questionnaire, uploaded some bare-faced selfies, entered my card details (£3.50 for month one, £19.99 thereafter) and waited for a real-life dermatologist to prescribe precisely the right formula to tackle my self-selected hitlist: melasma (brown patches of pigmentation); age-inevitable loss of firmness; general texture and dullness (a trademark of pandemic-related agoraphobia). Within a week I’d received my first monthly night cream (vegan), containing niacinamide, prescription-strength azelaic acid and tretinoin, the ante of which is raised with each delivery of the plastic-free click-doser. The effect on my skin is undeniable: tone is more even, pores are noticeably smaller and the very subtle increments in active ingredients meant I did not have a day’s redness or irritation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jan/02/sali-hughes-favourite-skincare-products-of-2020">Continue reading...</a>

Yet as cases in the UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/31/covid-turning-point-pandemic-unstoppable">continue to spiral</a>, with stricter social restrictions being implemented every few days, a key question remains: is anyone complying any more?</p><p>Compliance has been one of the most misunderstood and misrepresented concepts of this pandemic. During the first wave of the virus back in the spring, there was concern that a lengthy lockdown would lead to “behavioural fatigue” and diminishing compliance with social restrictions.

## After our 112-mile hike in the Sierra Nevada, I won’t underestimate my kids again

<p>Looking for a big adventure? A challenging Californian trek taught me and my boys the value of patience, trust and bottomless snacks</p><p>We were less than three minutes into our backpacking trip when the first tantrum erupted. Herbie, our eight-year-old, moaned that his pack was too heavy and threw it on to the floor of the car park. Only 112 miles to go, I thought. We might be embarking on a nightmare.</p><p>We knew our two-week hike through the Sierra Nevada was ambitious, but we’d been working towards it for some time. My husband, Will, and I are hardy campers, and have gradually won the enthusiasm of the kids (Herbie and his older brother, Artley, 11) when it comes to day hikes of 10 to 15 miles. Backpacking demands a love of camping and the outdoors, a high tolerance of dirt and discomfort, and some advanced organisational skills – including food planning, map reading and a near-obsessive preoccupation with lightweight kit. For this trip, we will be carrying everything our family needs to survive: tent, sleeping stuff, clothes, food (in bear-proof canisters), torches, first aid and water filters. For backpacking with kids, we also bring generous amounts of patience, most of our annual quota of optimism and a determination to enjoy it. And snacks. Lots of snacks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/02/after-our-112-mile-hike-in-the-sierra-nevada-i-wont-underestimate-my-kids-again">Continue reading...</a>

## There's no need to peel ginger | Waste not

<p>There’s so much waste when you peel fresh ginger, and it’s really not necessary – either scrape off the outer skin, or just chop it up peel and all</p><p>I used to peel my ginger badly, trimming off chunks of skin until I was left with a hexagonal prism and throwing a good third of the original unpeeled knob in the bin. Then a friend gave me this brilliant tip: instead of using a peeler, simply rub off the outer layer of skin with the back of a knife or spoon. These days, however, I rarely peel ginger at all; instead, I grate or finely chop it skin on, so now I waste nothing and get the benefits from the extra fibre, too. The skin is so papery, it all but disappears as it cooks, anyway.</p><p>In my experience, ginger keeps best unwrapped at room temperature in a dry place out of direct sunlight. That way, instead of moulding, it slowly dries out, preserving it for ever more (if you do want to store it in the fridge, it keeps best in an airtight container). If you have an abundance of ginger, you can preserve it by finely chopping it, freezing it on a plate, then crumbling it into a plastic tub and storing in the freezer for as long as is needed. Alternatively, preserve it by pickling it sushi-style.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/02/theres-no-need-to-peel-ginger-sushi-recipe-waste-not-tom-hunt">Continue reading...</a>
