Hospitals across the UK should prepare for London levels

Case numbers will increase next week

Case numbers were mild compared to where they would be in a week

Doctors were really worried

Almost half of the major hospital trusts in England are dealing with more Covid-19 than at the peak of the first wave

NHS having its busiest winter ever

There's no doubt that Christmas is going to have a big impact,

the new variant is also going to have a big impact, 

we know that is more infectious, more transmissible, 

so I think the large numbers that we're seeing in the South East, in London, in south Wales, is now going to be reflected over the next month, two months even, over the rest of the country

London's Nightingale emergency hospital is ready to admit patients

Other sites currently not in use are being readied
 
Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant

When we see the daily figures - we know that will sting us in about 10-12 days

Stop mixing with other households because it is spreading like wildfire - and we haven't got much more space in the hospitals left
