I honestly couldn't tell you what it's doing. Rings is going into it and pushed a bunch of buttons on it and then sent it a lot of modulation.\n\nPachinko is driving most of the sequence here, with some of its outputs going to a brancher and dual quantizer in u0_C. Rings goes to Data Bender and then Monsoon on the Loopable Delay mode. Plaits goes to Rainmaker. Rample is doing the voice snippets and going to Rainmaker too. VPME QD is doing the rest of the drums.\n\nBass is Dixie into Blades. Additional reverb voice is TS-L going into Polaris and the z5000. The Ensemble oscillator is doing some background work.\n\nFun feel.\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching. My name is Jeremy, and this is Red Means Recording. I've been making music for a few decades now, and this channel is a place to make music and to talk about the tools and techniques to make music with. We'll use synths, drum machines, modular gear, and software. \n\nIf you'd like to support the channel, I have a Patreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nI have music as \"Jeremy Blake\" on all the major services: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nI have some merch here: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nAnd you can connect with me here: \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSfhTh9hFV8", "date_published": "2021-01-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
