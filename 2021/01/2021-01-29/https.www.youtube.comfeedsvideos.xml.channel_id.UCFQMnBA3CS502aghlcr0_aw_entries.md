This is a response to the disgusting blackmail that I've been dealing with for 1 year that Swag Academy stumbled upon and put out on his channel as if it was true a few days ago. To Swag Academy's credit, upon learning that the information was 100% wrong, immediately deleted his video and issued an apology. Because of this, there is no feud between me and Swag Academy. This is not Internet drama, it's a disgusting tactic used by anonymous 'gurus' who are angry that their predatory lies have been exposed. I believe at the end of the day that Swag Academy made an unbelievably stupid error, but that he wouldn't have published the info had he known it was false. He has apologized to my wife and I, and while his initial response was COMPLETELY unwarranted and out of proportion, this is over between myself and him.  

The second part of this video is dedicated to the anonymous harassment and blackmail campaign I've been on the receiving end of since early 2020ish, the dates are a bit fuzzy at this point.  I've been hunting down the perpetrators of this and have IP logged some of them, received blackmail and other emails suggesting this is the work of some fragile millionaires upset with the work that I do on this channel.

this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.
