WHO official investigating pandemic warns world to 'manage expectations' as team leaves quarantine

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/27/official-investigating-pandmeic-origins-warns-world-manage-expectations/?WT.mc_id=e_DM1330317&WT.tsrc=email&etype=Edi_GHS_New_Daily&utmsource=email&utm_medium=Edi_GHS_New_Daily20210128&utm_campaign=DM1330317

Now in Wuhan, team of 13

Dutch virologist, Marion Koopmans

I think we really have to manage expectations, 

if you look at some of the earlier quests for the origins of outbreaks, 

they have taken years to complete.

has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019,

before the first identified case, 

with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses

In participants who received two doses of vaccine, 

median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts

18–55 years (n = 39)

56–69 years (n=26)

more than 70 years (n=47)

By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (more than 99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. 

T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19

Professor John Bell, Oxford University vaccine team

I’m not sure where he got that from

Other studies proved elderly people responded just as well in other age groups

there's really persuasive evidence that this is a protective vaccine in those populations

Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine Demonstrates 89.3% Efficacy in UK Phase 3 Trial

First to Demonstrate Clinical Efficacy Against UK and South Africa Variants

51% of phase 3 participants had new UK variant

Efficacy against old strain = 95.6% 

Efficacy against new variant = 85.6% 

Based on 62 cases

56 cases in the placebo group

6 cases in the vaccine group

Of the 62 cases, 61 were mild or moderate, and 1 was severe (in placebo group).

Safety

Interim analysis

Severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events occurred at low levels

Balanced between vaccine and placebo groups

Clive Dix, Chair, UK Vaccine Taskforce

These are spectacular results 

The efficacy shown against the emerging variants is also extremely encouraging

Also about South Africa

Prior infection with COVID-19 may not completely protect against subsequent infection by the South Africa escape variant

Vaccination with NVX-CoV2373 provided significant protection
