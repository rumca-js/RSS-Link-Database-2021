Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | January 29, 2021\nMuzz are dear, old friends who make fuzzy, thoughtful songs. So when they gathered at Reade's Old Kingston Theater in New York's Hudson Valley after seven months of separation, minus hugs and wearing masks, I trust it was joyful but also kind of awkward.\n\nPaul Banks and Josh Kaufman have known each other since childhood. You likely know Paul Banks as the singer for Interpol; Josh Kaufman is a producer and one-third of Bonny Light Horseman. They are both friends with drummer Matt Barrick, who played a Tiny Desk concert in 2012 with his band The Walkmen.\n\nThe songs here come from the trio's excellent self-titled debut album. Josh Kaufman told me via email that \"Paul was stuck in Glasgow and Matt and I were quarantining with families in Philadelphia and Brooklyn, respectively. At the very end of a long couple of days of rehearsal and taping, we \u2014 very late at night, Paul jet-lagged and the rest plain exhausted \u2014 stayed awake a little longer to try a campfire style strum along to some of the songs from our new LP. The result here is our Tiny Desk.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Bad Feeling\"\n\"Knuckleduster\"\n\"Trinidad\"\n\"Summer Love\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJosh Kaufman: guitar\nMatt Barrick: drums, percussion, keys\nPaul Banks: vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo/Recording/Mixing: D.
