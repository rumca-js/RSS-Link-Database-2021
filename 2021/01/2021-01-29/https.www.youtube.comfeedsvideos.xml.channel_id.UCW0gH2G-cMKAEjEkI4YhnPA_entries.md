In this first of two parts, we look at Morgoth's origins as Melkor, the mightiest Vala created by Ilúvatar, who rebels in the creation of the world and goes on to wreak havoc upon the Valar, the world, and its elf, man, and dwarf inhabitants.  Today, we cover everything from his discord during the Music of the Ainur to his destruction of the Two Trees with the giant spider Ungoliant.  His actions during this time, destroying the works of the Valar and manipulating the elves will set the stage for an Age of wars to come!
