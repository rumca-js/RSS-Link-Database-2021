In theory, it was a great idea that would allow any Call Of Duty player to engage in any mode and carry progress across games. In reality Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is a more traditional Call Of Duty title with a different audience from the mil-sim inspired Modern Warfare, so the merger has resulted in Warzone challenges that don\u2019t appeal to Cold War players, erased or made meaningless progress for Modern Warfare players, overpowered guns like the Mac-10 and DMR 14 in Warzone, and created unlocks that some players can\u2019t use unless they purchased the other title.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we talk about what we feel Activision was trying to achieve, why it\u2019s a good idea in theory, why it isn\u2019t working yet, and what they can focus on next. Call Of Duty titles published by Activision are developed by multiple studios including Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Raven Software, and Sledgehammer Games. This is the first time progress has been linked across two separate games and a standalone free-to-play battle-royale. We have yet to see if this shared ecosystem will be used moving forward for all Call Of Duty titles, but there are lessons to be learned either way.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZKZ6EGMqbY", "date_published": "2021-01-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "What The Heck Is Going On With GameStop", "description": "GameStop's stock value has been all over the place the past few days.
