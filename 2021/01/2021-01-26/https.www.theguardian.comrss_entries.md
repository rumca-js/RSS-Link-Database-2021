<p>When it comes to customer service, 2020 was a rollercoaster of a year for business, posing any number of challenges. So how do company owners feel they fared?</p><p>The last year has ripped up the rule book and made companies big and small rethink how they do business. We asked three company owners about the most valuable lessons they’ve learned when it comes to delivering great customer service: what went well, what went wrong, and how they put things right. Here are five key learnings from a year that made students of everyone.</p><p><strong>Keep communicating<br /></strong>If one thing has been necessary (and not always forthcoming) in this tumultuous year it’s good communication. With shops closed, staff furloughed and orders upended, customers needed clear explanations like never before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-business-of-customer-service/2021/jan/26/what-a-year-of-change-has-taught-me-retailers-five-top-tips-and-mistakes-revealed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a year of digital disruption, customers are clear about what they value. How do you get people raving about your business?</p><p>In a year of rapid change for businesses, the ability to adapt to new ways has quickly become the key to success – and customer service has proved to be one of the biggest areas for change. While good customer service has always been vital, in times of uncertainty, flux and complexity, it is critical.</p><p>“Customer expectations are so high that if you deliver bad customer service you get punished,” says Peter Lorant, chief operating officer EMEA of the customer service software company Zendesk. Its latest <a href="https://www.zendesk.co.uk/customer-experience-trends/?utm_source=press_release&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=2021_q1_emea_guardian_labs_cx_trends_report" rel="nofollow">Customer Experience Trends report</a> looks at companies that excel at customer service, so Lorant has a lot of information at his fingertips. “We’ve seen that half of customers will switch to a competitor after just one bad experience. Customers are ready to vote with their feet. And the kind of habits that customers have developed in the pandemic, they’re sticking with.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-business-of-customer-service/2021/jan/26/if-firms-arent-agile-theyll-be-left-behind-five-ways-customer-service-has-changed-forever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Messaging platforms are proving a big hit among companies keen to take customer service levels to new heights. Find out how two of them have transformed life for a sustainable travel firm and a champion of ethical clothing</p><p>It might seem an odd time to launch a travel company, but Cat Jones, founder of <a href="https://www.byway.travel" rel="nofollow">Byway</a>, a startup championing flight-free holidays, says it is actually turning out to be the right time. “With so much grounded, it’s almost been like a grand experiment in what happens if you don’t fly. There have been a lot of people keen to do more of this sort of travelling.”</p><p>Key to Jones’s vision is the personalised customer support she and her team provide through WhatsApp. Most of the trips so far have been in the UK but, even so, the team has been hard at work keeping customers updated in the light of ever-changing local restrictions and closures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-business-of-customer-service/2021/jan/26/people-really-want-that-human-connection-how-messaging-apps-are-giving-businesses-the-personal-touch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From wine shops to builders’ merchants, businesses are finding that customers expect quick and easy digital transactions – and rapid solutions if they reach out for help</p><p>For Kirby Bryant, the latest lockdown feels different from the first. For most of the 16 years she has run Cambridge Wine Royston, in Hertfordshire, Bryant saw e-commerce as directly conflicting with being local. But at the start of the Covid pandemic, she added a simple price list to the shop’s social media pages and invited orders by phone. She was promptly inundated “to the point where we had to unplug the connection”.</p><p>Since then, Bryant and her team have not only developed a simple website but have invested in connecting with customers via social media, email and phone, alongside other forms of remote interaction such as virtual tasting events. “The pandemic dragged us into the 21st century,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-business-of-customer-service/2021/jan/26/know-and-care-about-your-customers-why-online-communication-is-key-to-great-service">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The tactical modernist is very different from his predecessor at Stamford Bridge but could be just what Chelsea need now</p><p>According to the Thomas Tuchel playbook, managing a football team is “something you need to learn and understand, not a thing you do because there’s nothing else left or because it seems like the logical next step after 400 professional matches”. Tuchel wasn’t talking about Frank Lampard when he said these words.</p><p>Although it would surely make his likely arrival at Stamford Bridge a little spicier if he could rehash this statement for his opening remarks at the unveiling-station – ideally while wagging his finger and brandishing his economics diploma, his youth coaching medals, and all the other evidence of a coaching hinterland, a life spent outside the inner circle, that separates him from his immediate predecessor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/26/in-thomas-tuchel-chelsea-have-pivoted-to-a-kind-of-anti-frank-lampard">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Captivity, secrets and the spirit of Raymond Chandler lurk in remarkable new titles from Will Dean, Abigail Dean, Jane Harper and Steph Cha</p><p><em>Hodder &amp; Stoughton, £12.99, pp256</em><br /><br />Will Dean’s narrator “can feel bone shards scraping together, six-year-old shards” in her ankle, as <em>The Last Thing </em><em>to Burn</em> opens. She hobbles across the fields, desperate to escape the hell in which she has been living. But the vast flats of the east Midlands defeat her, and her captor drives up in a tractor to take her back to his tumbledown cottage. Thanh Dao, Dean’s heroine, is a Vietnamese woman who has illegally entered the UK with her sister, and found herself sold to a farmer who calls her Jane and treats her as his wife. She has been there for years, her life utterly controlled and utterly bleak, kept from escaping by the thought of what it would mean for her beloved sister. Any transgression means the farmer, Lenn, will burn one of her scant remaining possessions. Broken and drugged, she nonetheless finds some scrap of hope remaining. <em>The Last Thing to Burn </em>is one of the best thrillers I have read in years: I consumed it in great gulps, desperate to find out how Thanh Dao’s story played out, and then read it again, more slowly, savouring her courage and her unvanquished sense of self, despite everything.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/26/the-best-recent-thrillers-review-roundup-will-dean-abigail-jane-harper-steph-cha">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With care workers, nurses and bus drivers among those most likely to die, drastic action is needed by the state</p><p>Britain’s class system determines who is wealthy, who has power, and even who lives. Before Covid-19 arrived, if you were a man in one of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492">England’s poorest communities</a>, you could expect to live nine years fewer than someone in one of its most affluent areas. Those living in the poorest parts of Britain have a greater chance of suffering from <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(19)30045-2/fulltext">heart</a> and <a href="https://www.blf.org.uk/sites/default/files/British%20Lung%20Foundation%20-%20Lung%20disease%20and%20health%20inequalities%20briefing.pdf">lung disease</a>, and their children are more than <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-40731356">twice as likely</a> to be obese as those in the richest parts. People condemned to poor-quality housing are more likely to have illnesses <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(14)70279-6/fulltext">such as asthma</a>, and with mental health disproportionately damaged by the <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/Poverty%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf">stresses of poverty</a>, the poorest men are <a href="https://media.samaritans.org/documents/Samaritans_Dying_from_inequality_report_-_summary.pdf">up to 10 times</a> more at risk of suicide than the richest.</p><p>From the very start, the pandemic was always going to be shaped by the inequalities that define contemporary Britain. This is a virus that disproportionately inflicts the worst illness – and death – on those with underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, which disproportionately affect the poor. While middle-class professionals have the luxury of working in Covid-compliant homes, millions of working-class Britons cannot perform their tasks remotely. Many have no option but to cram into public transport en route to workplaces which often <a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/many-uk-workplaces-still-not-covid-secure-tuc-poll-reveals">do not enforce</a> safe social distancing to protect them. Recent <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregisteredbetween9marchand28december2020">statistics from the Office for National Statistics</a> show that care-home workers and nurses are among those most likely to die from coronavirus, alongside machine operatives, home carers, chefs, restaurant managers, nurses and bus drivers. These figures do not surprise, but they should still shock. Many of the key workers who people applauded from porches, windows and balconies during the first lockdown were cheered to their deaths.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/26/combination-covid-class-devastating-britain-poorest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At some point last season, Jürgen Klopp’s side adopted a measured approach based around control and drilled patterns but they mislaid a part of themselves in the process</p><p>What came first, the football or the fun? Does excellence on the pitch beget its own virtuous circle of good times, good vibes and good decisions? Or is successful football simply an expression of deeper traits: curiosity, ingenuity, outlook, an urge to move and be moved? Either way, these are probably the sorts of questions worth pondering as we address Liverpool’s current predicament. Because Liverpool’s biggest problem right now isn’t their league position or their front three or their cover at centre-half. It’s the absence of fun.</p><p>Results will bounce back soon enough. The underlying performance against Manchester United on Sunday was good, undone by some individual errors and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/24/manchester-united-liverpool-fa-cup-match-report" title="">brilliant free-kick from Bruno Fernandes</a>. They are neither as bad as they look now nor as good as they looked a month ago when many sensible observers were predicting they would win the league by 10 points. The centre-half issue, too, will work itself out. Injured players will return to fitness.

<p>The film producer on how having a son with Down syndrome inspired him to promote inclusion in the industry</p><p>Award-winning film producer Ken Ross is calling for more people with disabilities to be seen on TV and film screens all around the world. “If we never give individuals these roles, we’ll never move forward. We don’t need to change people to be the part we want them to be, and we don’t need to be worried about casting someone with a disability,” he says. “You would never ask someone to ‘black up’ to play Nelson Mandela – so why would you ask an actor to ‘impersonate’ someone with a disability?”</p><p>Ross has spent the past two decades working with the UK government, the NHS, Bafta and various other institutions to promote greater diversity and inclusion of people with disabilities. And although much has changed for the better (the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/24/bafta-tries-to-increase-diversity-with-120-changes-to-its-awards">Baftas</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/08/oscars-academy-awards-diversity-race-gender">Oscars</a> both recently revamped their diversity requirements, and actors such as <a href="https://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/elevate/tommy-jessop">Tommy Jessop</a>, who has Down syndrome, are increasingly gaining industry-wide recognition), there is still serious work to be done. Ross says: “We need to get sales agents feeling more comfortable screening films that have people with disabilities. And we’ve got to see people writing their own stories, too.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/26/ken-ross-disabled-person-as-famous-as-brad-pitt-on-screen-down-syndrome">Continue reading...</a>

That sum could apparently vaccinate every adult on Earth, as well as restore the income lost in 2020 to the world’s poorest people. </p><p>These figures emerged on the opening day of the Davos World Economic Forum, which is taking place virtually this year. They have not, I suspect, been peer-reviewed.

The backdrop of the screen industry suggests that his casual misogyny is symptomatic of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jun/02/artsfeatures.dvdreviews2">wider social disease</a>. Fifteen years later, Miike released Over Your Dead Body, a sort of companion piece, following a group of theatre actors in and out of rehearsals. Like Audition, the film – whose Japanese title is Kuime – explores deception and vengeance with slow-burning and increasingly grisly intensity. Amid its schlock and horror, it vividly retains a traditional theatricality that left me longing to see a proper production of the play at its centre.</p><p>That play is the ghost story <a href="http://www.kabuki21.com/yotsuya_kaidan.php">Yotsuya Kaidan</a>, about a ruthless samurai who is haunted by his rejected wife, Oiwa. The samurai is portrayed in the play by the cruel Kosuke who abandons his lover, the established stage performer Miyuki (who plays Oiwa in their production), and starts an affair with a younger actor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jan/26/takashi-miike-over-your-dead-body-best-films-set-in-the-theatre">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He partied with high society America but caused outrage when he spilled their secrets. Ebs Burnough talks us through his new film about Answered Prayers – the ‘smart, salacious’ novel Capote never finished</p><p>When Truman Capote died in 1984, he left the remains of a novel he had been hatching for nearly two decades, and talking about for almost as long. Answered Prayers, the story of a budding writer screwing his way through polite society, was intended to be Capote’s most explosive achievement. He likened it to a deadly weapon. “There’s the handle, the trigger, the barrel, and, finally, the bullet,” he told People magazine. “And when that bullet is fired from the gun, it’s going to come out with a speed and power like you’ve never seen – wham!” Having bragged about the book for years, all he had to do now was write it.</p><p>A contract was signed in 1966, but advance chapters published in Esquire magazine nine years later proved to be far below the standard of his defining successes, Breakfast at Tiffany’s and the “non-fiction novel” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/16/truman-capote-in-cold-blood">In Cold Blood</a>. There was a cost to his social reputation as well as his literary one. As soon as the socialites and wealthy wives with whom he had mingled happily for years – including Slim Keith, Babe Paley and Gloria Vanderbilt, whom he called his “swans” – saw how casually he had spilled their most intimate secrets, those friendships were dead. Capote hadn’t bitten the hand that fed him. He’d gnawed it off at the wrist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/26/truman-capote-tapes-answered-prayers-ebs-burnough-salacious">Continue reading...</a>

A complex and controversial character, he was a writer and political activist who was influential in both the American war of independence and the French Revolution.</p><p>An inscription on the plinth describes him as an “Englishman by birth; French citizen by decree; American by adoption.” The statue, by Charles Thomas Wheeler (1892-1974), was unveiled on 7 June 1964, gifted to the town of Thetford by the Thomas Paine Foundation in New York.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jan/26/the-great-british-art-tour-thetford-thomas-paine-statue">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One of Britain’s greatest designers, she has dressed everyone from Princess Diana to Diana Ross. She discusses punk, pink hair and staying creative after serious illness </p><p>Zandra Rhodes was doing a yoga session with a friend in the early weeks of the pandemic when she realised that something was wrong. “It’s a funny story,” she says. “We were lying on our lilac mats in my rainbow penthouse, and I was breathing deeply – and my stomach felt full. And I thought, why is it full? I haven’t had a meal today.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/nov/26/zandra-rhodes-reveals-lockdown-cancer-diagnosis">It turned out she had a tumour</a>. “It was in the bile [duct] and going into whatever’s near it,” she says, vaguely. Treatment involved weeks travelling across a locked-down London for chemotherapy, followed by an immunotherapy regime that she is still on, even though she is happy to say that the tumour is in full remission. Her first thought after diagnosis was “to get my will in order with a power of attorney that included a do-not-resuscitate order. I was very lucky because I had no pain whatsoever. I just got very tired while I was having the chemo.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jan/26/cancer-made-me-pull-my-life-together-zandra-rhodes-on-fun-fashion-and-freddie-mercury">Continue reading...</a>

## China's new animal health rules alone won't stop zoonotic outbreaks, experts warn

<p>Enforcement of rules and boosting numbers of vets to help with inspections, quarantines and general animal health seen as critical</p><p>China’s attempts to prevent another zoonotic disease outbreak will fail without deep changes in enforcement, oversight, and extensive investment to ramp up veterinary capacity, say experts.<br /><br />China’s top lawmakers last week approved revisions to the country’s law on preventing the spread of animal diseases. Amendments to the <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-01/20/c_139684651.htm">Animal Epidemic Prevention Law</a>, due to come into force in May, were accelerated in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. <br /><br />The outbreak of the deadly pig disease African swine fever (ASF), which has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/27/unstoppable-african-swine-fever-deaths-to-eclipse-record-2019-toll">decimated as much as 40%</a> of China’s pig production since 2018, has been an added impetus for reform.</p><p>The new measures include a system of quarantine standards for captive bred wildlife; revisions to a system for classifying animal epidemics based on their potential impact on human health, the economy and the public; compulsory vaccinations; and stipulations for veterinarians to pass qualification tests. <br /><br />However, observers said the challenge was poor enforcement of rules, rather than the need for new ones. “If China is truly to prevent and tackle future viruses, it is immensely important that the revised law is not simply adopted or revised and then ignored,” Peter J Li, a China policy specialist at the Humane Society International, told the Guardian.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/26/chinas-new-animal-health-rules-alone-wont-stop-zoonotic-outbreaks-experts-warn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At two months old, Maria Diemar was flown to Sweden to be adopted. Years later, she tracked down her birth mother, who said her baby had been taken against her will. Now investigations are showing that she was one of thousands stolen from their parents<br /></p><p>For as long as she can remember, Maria Diemar has known she was adopted. Her Swedish parents were always open about her Chilean heritage, and growing up in Stockholm in the 1970s and 80s with brown skin and dark hair, it was impossible not to notice she was different.</p><p>When she was 11, Diemar’s parents showed her the papers that arrived with her in Sweden as a two-month-old baby in 1975. The file on her parentage offered a brief, unflattering portrait of a teenage mother who sent her newborn girl to be raised by strangers on the other side of the world. “They said she was a live-in maid, that she had a son who lived with her parents, and that she was poor,” recalled Diemar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jan/26/chile-stolen-children-international-adoption-sweden">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Several national surveys suggest people from black, Asian and minority backgrounds are far more likely to reject having the Covid-19 vaccine than their white counterparts. Nazia Parveen and Annabel Sowemimo explain the root causes of this hesitancy</p><p>There are now more than 6 million people in the UK who have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as efforts to speed up the inoculations process continue to intensify. But as more of those in the highest risk age groups get their jabs, there are growing concerns in government about the rates of vaccine hesitancy in some black and minority ethnic communities. </p><p>The Guardian’s communities correspondent <strong>Nazia Parveen </strong>tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys </strong>that, despite evidence that those in minority groups were hit hardest by the first wave of Covid-19 last year, they are among the least likely to take up the offer of a vaccine. Misinformation circulating on social media including false rumours that the vaccine may contain alcohol or pork have spread widely and are proving difficult to counter. But perhaps more challengingly, there are structural, cultural and language barriers to overcome too. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2021/jan/26/vaccine-hesitancy-what-is-behind-the-fears-circulating-in-bame-communities-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

But according to new research these are some of the possible misfortunes to have befallen those in centuries gone by.</p><p>An analysis of bones from 314 individuals aged 12 or older, dating from around 1100 to the 1530s, and found in three different sites across Cambridge, reveals that bone fractures were common among those buried in a parish cemetery – where many ordinary workers would have been laid to rest. But the team also found evidence of horrific injuries among those buried in an Augustinian friary, suggesting the clergy were not protected against violent events.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jan/26/friar-crushed-by-cart-bone-analysis-hints-at-causes-of-medieval-deaths">Continue reading...</a>
