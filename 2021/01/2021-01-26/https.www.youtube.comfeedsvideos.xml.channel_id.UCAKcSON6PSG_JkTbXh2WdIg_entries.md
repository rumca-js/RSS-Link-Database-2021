## Listen to Looch: the story of Rolling Stones sax player Bobby Keys
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx10e5DT180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx10e5DT180)

If you're like Mary Lucia and love the Rolling Stones, then Mary has a documentary for you: "Every Night's a Saturday Night," that is about the legendary saxophone player, Bobby Keys. Good ol' boy, born outside of Lubbock, Texas. The documentary really goes deep into all those Keys played with, which is astonishing, because his tone and the way he played is so singular, that you can pull it out of almost any recording.

Most prevalent in Keys' career is his time with the Rolling Stones. Keys is lauded by Charlie Watts, and was great friend with Keith Richards. Keys is as much a part of that band as any of them, and even Keith says Keys might be considered the fifth Rolling Stone.

## Half Moon Run - three songs at The Current (2020)

When Montreal band Half Moon Run visited The Current studio on Jan. 23, 2020 , frontman Devon Portielje said something unexpected about something that inspired him to pursue music. "About 10 years ago, 2008, I think I saw Yeasayer on The Current [YouTube channel]," Portielje recalls, "and I was like, 'What is that style of music? What are they doing?' They had this weird drum beat and all these vocal effects and I thought, 'I want to do that.'"

Portielje explains he was simply following a thread YouTube was suggesting to him, but yes indeed, it was through The Current that he found sessions by Bon Iver, Tegan and Sara and others. "I started to be like, 'Oh — so this is indie music!'" Portielje said.

At the time Half Moon Run visited The Current, they were Juno Award nominees. In June of 2020 — following a cancelled live Junos ceremony that ultimately went virtual — Half Moon Run took home the Juno Award for Adult Alternative Album of the Year for their 2019 release, "A Blemish in the Great Light." Watch Half Moon Run perform two songs from that album, along with one from their 2012 release "Dark Eyes," from their session recorded in The Current studio in January 2020.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Full Circle"
3:03 "Favourite Boy"
7:01 "Jello On My Mind"
