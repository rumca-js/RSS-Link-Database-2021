*HUGE DISCLAIMER* I do NOT own any gamestop stock (although I wish I had bought in early), but I DO NOT advise it now or ever. This is a meme tribute to all the idiots over at r/wallstreetbets. I REPEAT, do NOT buy GameStop unless you are prepared to lose 100% of the money. Itâ€™s straight up gambling at this point.

this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.

I"M NEVER SELLING. DAN LOK'S HOUSE IS MINE AND I'M KEEPING IT! DAN LOK literally could offer me millions of $$$ and I would refuse. 

A REVIEW OF EARTH 2
VERDICT ON Earth2.io 
This is NOT an investment. MOST people will NOT make their money back and you should look at it as an investment into an extremely RISKY idea with no alpha and a young development team.

Brian Rose Is the King of the ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡'s
But  now he's using this "arrest" (it was just a fine) to try to stir up sympathy. He's lying about why though.. it wasn't for campaigning, it was for legitimately being irresponsible.
