The situation in Portugal is horrible

We are now in lockdown but until last week the Government insisted in keeping schools open... 

We are staying at home for a year working from home because I never trusted our numbers. 

And yet the planes keep coming and the Hospitals at 300 per cent occupation rate.

We have concern about the mutation that’s in South Africa

It is clearly different and more ominous than the one in the U.K.

Mr. Biden

1.5 million per day

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-vaccine-coronavirus/2021/01/25/f1ce56dc-5f2e-11eb-9430-e7c77b5b0297_story.html

I think with the grace of God . . . we’ll be able to get that to 1.5 million a day

(Now close to 1 million per day)

By spring, everyone who wants a vaccine should be able to get one.

It’s going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we’ve ever tried in this country, but I think we can do that

I feel confident that by summer we’re going to be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity. I feel good about where we’re going, and I think we can get it done

We will still be talking about this into the summer

We’re still going to be dealing with this issue in the early fall

Death toll could rise to 600,000 or even 660,000
