When Boris Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/03/coronavirus-restrictions-probably-about-to-get-tougher-says-boris-johnson\">interviewed</a> by Andrew Marr today it was striking to see so much of the conversation devoted to schools, but there was a wearying familiarity to the vagueness of the prime minister\u2019s position on urgent issues. The fact that there is no clear line even on the proposed opening of all schools in England a fortnight from now hardly answers people\u2019s need for clarity and leadership.</p><p>Yet again councils, who are only too aware of local realities, have objected to edicts from Whitehall. In London, boroughs that rejected the demand that their primary schools open on 4 January forced yet another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/02/the-governments-u-turns-on-education-in-england\">government U-turn</a>. Meanwhile, as concerns grow about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc9e53ff-fbda-4be2-8bdf-24ae2cf1c569\">new variant</a> spreading via schools, talk of \u201ca switch to online learning\u201d is now common \u2013 yet this could exacerbate many hard realities that have emerged during the pandemic. For plenty of families, \u201cconnectivity\u201d amounts to a pay-as-you-go smartphone running on a mobile network; in millions of cases, remote learning is a completely vain hope.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/03/england-children-schooling-pandemic-schools\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/03/england-children-schooling-pandemic-schools", "date_published": "2021-01-03 15:32:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Naturists criticise Durham police over Facebook post about arrest", "description": "<p>Naturist group say post suggested public nudity was illegal and could put them at risk of harassment<br /></p><p>A group of naturists have accused police of putting them at risk after wrongly suggesting it was illegal to walk around naked.</p><p>Three Rivers Outdoor Club, a naturist club based in the north-east of England, complained about a Facebook post by Durham constabulary, following reports of a naked man walking around Waldridge Fell, near Chester-le-Street.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/03/naturists-criticise-durham-police-facebook-post-nudity-arrest\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/03/naturists-criticise-durham-police-facebook-post-nudity-arrest", "date_published": "2021-01-03 15:10:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Greta Thunberg at 18: 'I'm not telling anyone what to do'", "description": "<p>Environmental activist says she has stopped buying new clothes but will not criticise those who fly or have children</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\">Greta Thunberg</a> says she has stopped buying new clothes but does not sit in judgment on others whose lifestyle choices are less environmentally friendly than her own, in an interview to mark her 18th birthday.</p><p>Thunberg, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis\">solo school strike in 2018</a> snowballed into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/27/climate-crisis-6-million-people-join-latest-wave-of-worldwide-protests\">global youth movement</a>, stopped flying several years ago, travelling instead by boat.
