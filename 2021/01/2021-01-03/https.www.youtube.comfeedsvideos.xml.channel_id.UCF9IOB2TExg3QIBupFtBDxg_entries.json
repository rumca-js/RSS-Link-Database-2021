good news", "description": "Journal of Infection\n\nhttps://www.journalofinfection.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0163-4453%2820%2930781-7\n\nPre-proof, accepted manuscript\n\nMain points\n\nWhether SARS-CoV-2 infection confers immunity to reinfection is uncertain \n\nThe \u2018second wave\u2019 of transmission offered an opportunity to examine this \n\nWe observed no symptomatic reinfections in a cohort of healthcare workers \n\nThis apparent immunity to re-infection was maintained for at least 6 months \n\nFurther studies are required to define immunological mechanism(s) and durability \n\nAlso\n\nImmunity to seasonal coronaviruses is (probably) maintained for up to 12 months \n\nThe study\n\nN = 11,103 healthcare workers, documented evidence of previous infection status\n\nFirst wave\n\nMarch to April 2020\n\nSecond wave\n\nOctober to November 2020\n\nNewcastle and North Tyne\n \nRT-PCR testing, all HCWs with symptoms, since early March 2020\n\nExtensive IgG antibody testing, 937 / 11,103\n\nInfected group\n\nN = 1,038, with evidence of previous infection (positive PCR and/or Ab)\n\nNon infected group\n\nN = 10,137 without (negative Ab, without positive PCR)\n\nEndpoint analysis, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nUp to 20th Nov 2020\n\n2,243 HCWs underwent PCR testing for symptoms\n\n128 had previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\n2,115 had not had previous infection\n\nIn those previously infected, median of 173 (IQR: 162-229) days from first positive PCR/antibody result\n\nPrevious infection group\n\nTest positivity rates, 0% (0 out of 128)\n\nNo previous infection group\n\nTest positivity rates, 13.7% (290 out of 2,115)\n\n(less than 0.0001 \uf0632 test)\n\nOne in 10,000\n Asymptomatic PCR screening\n\nN = 481 HCWs\n\nWith past infection\n\nN = 106\n\nPositivity rate = 0% (0 out of 106)\n\nWithout past infection\n\nN =  375\n\nPositivity rate = 5.9% (22 out of 375)\n\nConclusion\n\nImmunity is maintained for at least 6 months\n\nInfection appears to result in protection against symptomatic infection in working age adults, at least in the short term. \n\nThis is consistent with\n\nThe low rates of reinfection reported in the literature\n\nThe reported ability of vaccines to protect with high efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3kQoyCCLmY", "date_published": "2021-01-04
