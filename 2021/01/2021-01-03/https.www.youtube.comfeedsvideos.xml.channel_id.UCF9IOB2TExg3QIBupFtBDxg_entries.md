Journal of Infection

https://www.journalofinfection.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0163-4453%2820%2930781-7

Pre-proof, accepted manuscript

Main points

Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection confers immunity to reinfection is uncertain 

The ‘second wave’ of transmission offered an opportunity to examine this 

We observed no symptomatic reinfections in a cohort of healthcare workers 

This apparent immunity to re-infection was maintained for at least 6 months 

Further studies are required to define immunological mechanism(s) and durability 

Also

Immunity to seasonal coronaviruses is (probably) maintained for up to 12 months 

The study

N = 11,103 healthcare workers, documented evidence of previous infection status

First wave

March to April 2020

Second wave

October to November 2020

Newcastle and North Tyne
 
RT-PCR testing, all HCWs with symptoms, since early March 2020

Extensive IgG antibody testing, 937 / 11,103

Infected group

N = 1,038, with evidence of previous infection (positive PCR and/or Ab)

Non infected group

N = 10,137 without (negative Ab, without positive PCR)

Endpoint analysis, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection

Up to 20th Nov 2020

2,243 HCWs underwent PCR testing for symptoms

128 had previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection

2,115 had not had previous infection

In those previously infected, median of 173 (IQR: 162-229) days from first positive PCR/antibody result

Previous infection group

Test positivity rates, 0% (0 out of 128)

No previous infection group

Test positivity rates, 13.7% (290 out of 2,115)

(less than 0.0001 2 test)

One in 10,000
 Asymptomatic PCR screening

N = 481 HCWs

With past infection

N = 106

Positivity rate = 0% (0 out of 106)

Without past infection

N =  375

Positivity rate = 5.9% (22 out of 375)

Conclusion

Immunity is maintained for at least 6 months

Infection appears to result in protection against symptomatic infection in working age adults, at least in the short term. 

This is consistent with

The low rates of reinfection reported in the literature

The reported ability of vaccines to protect with high efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2

## Vaccinations slow, new variant fast

Hospitals across the UK should prepare for London levels

Case numbers will increase next week

Case numbers were mild compared to where they would be in a week

Doctors were really worried

Almost half of the major hospital trusts in England are dealing with more Covid-19 than at the peak of the first wave

NHS having its busiest winter ever

There's no doubt that Christmas is going to have a big impact,

the new variant is also going to have a big impact, 

we know that is more infectious, more transmissible, 

so I think the large numbers that we're seeing in the South East, in London, in south Wales, is now going to be reflected over the next month, two months even, over the rest of the country

London's Nightingale emergency hospital is ready to admit patients

Other sites currently not in use are being readied
 
Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant

When we see the daily figures - we know that will sting us in about 10-12 days

Stop mixing with other households because it is spreading like wildfire - and we haven't got much more space in the hospitals left

UK, Schools

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55511662

NEU, All schools in England should shut for two weeks after the Christmas break

As well as London
