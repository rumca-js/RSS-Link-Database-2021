Instead we should be working out how to keep everyone in education safe<br /></p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jan/01/all-primary-schools-in-london-to-remain-closed-after-u-turn">crisis</a> enveloping schools, and the noisy resentment it has sparked, reflect just about every aspect of England’s Covid-19 story. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has taken the government’s grim mixture of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/03/meet-the-new-breed-of-cabinet-minister-too-rubbish-to-fail">arrogance and incompetence</a> to new depths. When Boris Johnson was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/03/coronavirus-restrictions-probably-about-to-get-tougher-says-boris-johnson">interviewed</a> by Andrew Marr today it was striking to see so much of the conversation devoted to schools, but there was a wearying familiarity to the vagueness of the prime minister’s position on urgent issues. The fact that there is no clear line even on the proposed opening of all schools in England a fortnight from now hardly answers people’s need for clarity and leadership.</p><p>Yet again councils, who are only too aware of local realities, have objected to edicts from Whitehall. In London, boroughs that rejected the demand that their primary schools open on 4 January forced yet another <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/02/the-governments-u-turns-on-education-in-england">government U-turn</a>. Meanwhile, as concerns grow about the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dc9e53ff-fbda-4be2-8bdf-24ae2cf1c569">new variant</a> spreading via schools, talk of “a switch to online learning” is now common – yet this could exacerbate many hard realities that have emerged during the pandemic. For plenty of families, “connectivity” amounts to a pay-as-you-go smartphone running on a mobile network; in millions of cases, remote learning is a completely vain hope.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/03/england-children-schooling-pandemic-schools">Continue reading...</a>

## Covid has made 'voice notes' the perfect way to stay connected | Magdalene Abraha

<p>During these alienating times, verbal messages helped us to communicate quickly while maintaining intimacy and friendship<br /></p><p>As the pandemic transformed the world in 2020, we leaned further into our reliance on technology, which continued to alter and tweak how we engage with each other. There were obvious winners; the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/zoom">Zoom app</a> thrived; another <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/can-the-houseparty-app-help-us-stay-sane-in-quarantine-i-downloaded-it-to-find-out">app called Houseparty</a> was the biggest thing for all of two weeks before it was never heard of again. Amid all these crazes, however, a quietly unassuming communication tool also flourished – the small but mighty “voice note”.</p><p>First introduced by WhatsApp in 2013, and later adopted by iMessage, Facebook and Instagram, the voice note – a short recorded message – became an instant success among millennials. Initially its rise was spoken of as a passing fad, but time has shown it has in fact become a major communicative asset.<em><strong> </strong></em>Seen by many as the perfect medium between phone calls, texts and unwanted voicemails, the voice note fits seamlessly into the modern world in a way that its cousins the phone call and voicemail do not. At some point in the past five years, “let me voice note you” has become one of my most-used phrases, as I try to explain something in detail and depth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/03/covid-voice-notes-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

## Slash and Burn by Claudia Hernández review – challenging and vivid

<p>Stream of consciousness and indirect speech bring life and layers to a sharp evocation of women caught up in civil war</p><p>Salvadorian writer Claudia Hernández’s immersive novel, superbly translated by Julia Sanches, explores war and its aftermath from a female perspective. Hernández never states the setting is El Salvador, places are referred to as “the farm named after a horse” or “that place named after insects”, and her characters are unnamed. During the conflict, “not knowing a person’s real name or where they were from was a safety measure”. Instead, they are referred to as “mothers”, “daughters” and “sisters”. This lends a universality to the text, reminding us that the brutalities of war are the same the world over.</p><p>As a young girl, Hernández’s main narrator follows her beloved father into the hills and becomes a guerrilla, fighting for the rights of the poor. There, she conceives her first daughter with a fellow combatant, but is forced to give her up for safe keeping. When the war ends, she discovers the nuns have sold her baby to a childless couple in France, “to help fund the cause”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/03/slash-and-burn-by-claudia-hernandez-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sparks fly between Thompson and Nnamdi Asomugha in this glossy period melodrama set in 1950s Harlem</p><p>Sylvie (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/16/tessa-thompson-interview-decided-not-to-work-until-i-burned-for-something">Tessa Thompson</a>) has been taught by her mother to stand tall, shoulders back and chin lifted, like a proper lady. Unobserved, she’s considerably looser, freer, grooving to Bill Haley’s See You Later, Alligator in the back of her father’s record store. It’s this uninhibited joy that catches the eye of struggling jazz saxophonist Robert (NFL player turned actor Nnamdi Asomugha) in Eugene Ashe’s glossy period romance.</p><p>Set in Harlem between 1957 and 1962, the lusty spark between the pair combusts despite Sylvie’s engagement to the more respectable Lacy (Alano Miller). An unexpected pregnancy and a career-making gig in Paris are further obstacles. Thompson and Asomugha have great chemistry, but the film stalls a little in the second half, when the focus pivots towards the couple’s careers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/03/sylvies-love-review-tessa-thompson-nnamdi-asomugha-harlem-50s">Continue reading...</a>

We eat (or perhaps I should say “wolf”) our parcels as each becomes ready, bobbing to the surface, the grated vegetables turned into crisp, unruly fritters.</p><p>Another day, we eat chips cooked in the oven, each long, fat finger of potato in a coat of semolina – I use fine polenta – and Lebanese za’atar with its notes of dried wild thyme, sesame and oregano. As they rustle on to our plates, there is a tiny bowl of garlic sauce, a dip of red pepper, olive oil and egg at their side.

<p>With no wriggle room left at the inn for our slippery friends, Christmas Eve won’t be the same again</p><p>An eel farmer in Gloucestershire who exports eels to continental Europe, and who voted for Brexit, may lose his business because of eel paperwork incurred by the red-tape-removing Brexit he voted for. One can only pity him, and his eels. The time for filthy Remainer schadenfreude has passed. But regular readers will remember that I was among many in the liberal commentariat ridiculed for flagging up the post-Brexit fate of eels. Indeed, to highlight the issue in the spring of 2016, I and Bob Geldof swam the full length of the Severn estuary dressed as eels, while Nigel Farage bombarded us with scoops of mash from an amphibious vehicle. Our gesture was, predictably, dismissed as part of “Project Fear” by Dan Hananananan in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, and yet our projected fears have come true. Before the eel farmer voted, he should have sought eel advice from a source better equipped than him to understand the eel issues. An eel perhaps. Brexit! It’s like eels voting for some kind of religious festival where everyone eats eels.</p><p>Why did the bleary-faced Brexit gangmaster Michael Gove have such contempt for eels and their future outside the single market? Is it revenge, because his telescopic eyes, beak-like rostrum and aquatic pallor make him look like an out-of-focus underwater photograph of an eel? Old school friends at Robert Gordon’s college say that, for the otherwise icy Gove, being mocked in the showers for his resemblance to the tasty fish was his achilles eel. It is even rumoured on the dark web that Gove himself was once mistaken for an eel by his co-Brexiter Mark Francois while frolicking in a culvert, leading to a shameful incident involving a scoop of mash and some liquor that it took all of his wife Sarah Vine’s press connections to conceal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/03/this-deal-is-enough-to-make-an-eel-squeal">Continue reading...</a>

I want the same as everyone else: to see my family more; to hug friends; to move through life unencumbered by an awareness of every particle that lands on my skin; to squeeze once more through tight-packed crowds of sweaty, bleating strangers. It’s been a massive blow to my brand to realise that I – me! – miss large gatherings on wet days, or mediocre pints in dreary pubs, or gardens teeming with people shushing you for talking during Ireland football matches, even though talking during Ireland matches is the only way it is medically possible to get through Ireland matches.</p><p>In March, I joked that, when this all ends, I intend to french kiss every one of my friends for 45 minutes apiece. That seemed like a funny length for a snog, presuming an affection gap lasting, say, 12 weeks. How naive I was. After nine months, I now see I criminally underestimated my pangs.

It is not something that might happen in the future; we are already seeing terrible hurricanes and floods and fires. It is building up into an inferno. When you think globally like that, it is very, very depressing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/03/jane-goodall-change-is-happening-there-are-many-ways-to-start-moving-in-the-right-way">Continue reading...</a>

## Do we have to age?

<p>The biologist Andrew Steele thinks ageing is a disease that can be treated. But if we had a cure for getting old, what would that mean for us?</p><p>When the biologist Andrew Steele tells people his thoughts on ageing – that we might one day cure it as if it were any other disease – they are often incredulous and sometimes hostile. Once, at a friend’s wedding, he left a group of guests mildly incensed for suggesting that near-future humans might live well into their 100s. A similar thing happens at dinner parties, where the responses are more polite but no less sceptical. He understands the reaction. We think of ageing as an inescapable fact of life – we’re born, we grow old, so it goes. “That’s been the narrative for thousands of years,” he says, on a video call. But what if it didn’t have to be?</p><p>Steele began professional life as a physicist. As a child, he was fascinated by space, the way many scientists are. But he has spent the past three years researching a book about biogerontology, the scientific study of ageing, in which he argues the case for a future in which our lives go on and on. Steele considers ageing “the greatest humanitarian issue of our time”. When he describes growing old as “the biggest cause of suffering in the world,” he is being earnest. “Ageing is this inevitable, creeping thing that happens,” he says. He is wearing a button-down shirt and, at 35, a look of still-youthful optimism. “We’re all quite blind to its magnitude. But what do people die of? Cancer. Heart disease. Stroke. These things all occur in old people, and they primarily occur <em>because of</em> the ageing process.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jan/03/observer-magazine-do-we-have-to-age-biologist-andrew-steele">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A rare white-out in London, captured by Peter Marlow in 2009, found sledgers running for the hills as the city ground to a halt<br /></p><p>In the 30-odd years that I’ve lived in London, I can think of only half a dozen proper sledging days. The capital’s comical lack of preparedness for white-outs is, of course, a source of amusement for other, snowier parts of the country. But then, why prepare for something that never happens? (Until it does.)</p><p>Peter Marlow’s picture of Greenwich Park from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/gallery/2009/feb/06/weather">February 2009</a> recalls a day on which schools were closed for all the right reasons and public transport slithered to a predictable halt. The headline in the London <em>Evening Standard</em> read: “It’s -5 and we’re going snowhere!” But that wasn’t quite true. Everyone with a tea tray in the cupboard or an underused toboggan in the attic fetched it out and trudged to the nearest hill.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2021/jan/03/the-big-picture-the-right-kind-of-snow-london-2009">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gary Taubes argues persuasively that ‘those who fatten easily’ should abandon carbs altogether</p><p>The investigative journalist Gary Taubes is known for his painstakingly researched and withering demolitions of the “eat less, move more” diet orthodoxy, but his latest book is personal. <em>The Case for Keto</em> is aimed at “those of us who fatten easily”. Taubes locates himself in this beleaguered group, “despite an addiction to exercise for the better part of a decade” and a diet of “low-fat, mostly plant ‘healthy’ eating”. “I avoided avocados and peanut butter because they were high in fat and I thought of red meat, particularly steak and bacon, as an agent of premature death. I ate only the whites of egg.” Yet still he remained overweight.</p><p>Taubes started to shed those pounds when he realised that one-size-fits-all diet advice fails, among other reasons, because people are metabolically different. Some of us can eat fattening carbohydrates and sugar and get away with it; others can’t.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/03/the-case-for-keto-review-why-a-full-fat-diet-should-be-on-the-menu">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New ventures by chefs in the suburbs promise a return to vitality for the restaurant sector</p><p>Let’s start with the good news. For the UK’s restaurant sector, 2021 will be better than 2020. This is only because, short of your actual Godzilla rising from the depths just off Folkestone at the same time as a chunky asteroid wilfully redirects itself to slam into, say, Birmingham, laying waste to everything within a 500-mile radius, it’s hard to imagine it being worse. And even then, it will only be better for the ones who have survived. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/18/uk-restaurants-and-pubs-call-for-help-as-72-fear-closing-permanently" title="">recent survey</a> by various industry bodies found more than 70% of hospitality businesses expected to close, if the current Covid-19 restrictions stayed in place unchanged. We have already seen a number of casualties. Michel Roux Jr’s restaurant at Parliament Square has gone, for example and, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/22/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-tramshed-project-london-it-is-so-now" title="">reported here</a> recently, chef Mark Hix has seen his whole London restaurant group close.</p><p>Happy days. A look forward to the coming year should, of course, be full of lip-smacking accounts of twists on double-fried Korean chicken wings, deep dives into the compelling cooking styles of hitherto neglected regions of west Africa or India, or nerdy experiments with live fire cooking. And in the next 12 months, I hope there will be lots of that. A great meal out can also be an education.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/03/eating-out-is-one-of-the-bright-sparks-to-look-forward-to-this-year">Continue reading...</a>
