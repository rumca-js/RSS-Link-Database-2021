pandemic\n\nhttps://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/opening-remarks-for-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19-5-january-2021\n\nOver the past 24 hours, members of the international scientific team on COVID-19 virus origins began traveling from their home countries to China. \n\nToday we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team\u2019s arrival in China. \n\nWe are eager to get the mission underway as soon as possible.\n\nChina CDC researcher Wu Zunyou\n\nQingdao outbreak (October)\n\nVirus could survive long trips in a deep freeze and still infect people\n\nImports from abroad caused the spread and transmission of this outbreak\n\nBackground\n\nTop-secret Wuhan Institute of Virology, 11 miles from the market\n\nSpecialises in the study of bat-borne viruses \n\nUS officials who visited the lab two years ago warned about safety weaknesses and the risks of a new Sars-like epidemic emerging from the site\n\nWorking with prominent Western experts and supported financially by the National Institutes of Health\n\nDeputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger\n\nOfficials within China have rejected the theory that the virus originated from a wet market in Wuhan.\n\nCritics fear the probe will be a whitewash given China's influence on the WHO\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9106951/Lab-leak-credible-source-coronavirus-outbreak-says-government-official.html\n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/growing-body-of-evidence-coronavirus-leaked-from-chinese-lab-top-trump-official-claims?=\n\nThere is a growing body of evidence to say that a laboratory leak or accident is very much a credible possibility\n\nEven establishment figures in Beijing have openly dismissed the wet market story\n\nSmoking associated with increased risk of COVID-19 symptoms\n\nhttps://thorax.bmj.com/content/early/2021/01/05/thoraxjnl-2020-216422\n\nhttps://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-smoking-risk\n\nBackground \n\nAssociation between current tobacco smoking\n\nRisk of developing symptomatic COVID-19\n\nSeverity of illness\n\nMethods\n\nDemographics\n\nAnthropometrics\n\nSmoking status\n\nMedical conditions\n\nAnyone feeling unwell\n\nAsked about 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms\n\nand about hospital attendance\n\nAssociation between symptoms was also compared between smokers and non-smokers.\n\nResults\n\nBetween March 24th  and 23rd April 2020\n\nN = 2,401,982 participants\n\nMean age 43.6\n\nFemale, 63.3%\n\nOverall smoking prevalence 11.0%\n\n(14.1%, 2019)\n\nFeeling unwell, 834,437 (35%), entered one or more symptoms\n\nCurrent smokers were more likely to report symptoms suggesting a diagnosis of COVID-19\n\nOR = 1.14\n\nMore than 5 symptoms, OR = 1.29\n\nMore than 10 symptoms, OR = 1.50\n\nInterpretation\n\nSmokers at an increased risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19\nSmokers had more severe symptoms\n\nMario Falchi\n\nSome reports have suggested a protective effect of smoking on COVID-19 risk.\n\nHowever, studies in this area can easily be affected by biases in sampling, participation and \nresponse. \n\nOur results clearly show that smokers are at increased risk of suffering from a wider range of COVID-19 symptoms than non-smokers\n\nClaire Steves, lead researcher and consultant physician\n\nAs rates of COVID-19 continue to rise and the NHS edges towards capacity, \nit\u2019s important to do all we can to reduce its effects and find ways to reduce hospital admissions. \n\nOur analysis shows that smoking increases a person\u2019s likelihood to attend hospitals, \nso stopping smoking is one of the things we can do to reduce the health consequences of the disease\n\nUK\n\nhttps://covid.joinzoe.com/data#levels-over-time\n\nhttps://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases\n\nData, 7th Jan
