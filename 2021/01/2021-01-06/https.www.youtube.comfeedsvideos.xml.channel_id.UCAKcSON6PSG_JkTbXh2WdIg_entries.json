The film shows how Carter's lifelong passion for music gave him an unexpected edge as a presidential candidate as he tapped into a force that transcended racial and generational divides, and often party lines. Carter\u2019s appreciation for all genres of music and friendships with the likes of Bob Dylan, Gregg Allman, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, and Willie Nelson helped to define his administration. \n\n\"I cannot think of a better recommendation for this time,\" Mary says, \"this day, this moment in history, for you to watch and feel hopeful and charmed and believe in the goodness of government.\"\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#jimmycarter #cnnfilms #marylucia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhMQFIvODQI", "date_published": "2021-01-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
