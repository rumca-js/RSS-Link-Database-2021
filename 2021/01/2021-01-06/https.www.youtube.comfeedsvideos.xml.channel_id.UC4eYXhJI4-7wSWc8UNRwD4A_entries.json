Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nJanuary 6, 2021 | Bob Boilen\nFrom a stunning room overlooking the San Gabriel Mountains in Pasadena, Calif., we hear the ethereal sounds of Active Child. \"I chose this space, as this is where I've written nearly every piece of music for my active child project. my music and this house / this view are completely intertwined.\"\n\nActive Child is the music of Patrick Grossi. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he layers his choral-styled voice on top of melodic harp and piano. Electronic beats propel selections from his latest album, In Another Life, as well as one of his earliest and well-known songs, \"Hanging On,\" that we featured on NPR Music back in 2011. Active Child makes music like no one else, and this Tiny Desk (home) concert is a perfect way to experience his music.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Hanging On\"\n\"In Another Life\"\n\"Cruel World\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nActive Child (Patrick Grossi): vocals, harp, piano, beats\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Audio: Patrick Grossi\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle Smith\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9hZFjbOsWg", "date_published": "2021-01-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
