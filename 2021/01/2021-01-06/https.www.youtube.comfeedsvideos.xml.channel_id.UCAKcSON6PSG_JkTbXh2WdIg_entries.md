Seven years ago, Milwaukee band Field Report's "Marigolden" was our Album of the Week. Field Report's latest album, "Brake Light Red Tide," was released in April 2020, but naturally, Chris Porterfield and friends couldn't tour in the midst of a pandemic. In the before times, Field Report visited our studio on a few occasions; here are two performances recorded in our studio. 

SONGS PERFORMED

Mary Lucia talks about a new documentary from CNN Films, 'Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President.' The film shows how Carter's lifelong passion for music gave him an unexpected edge as a presidential candidate as he tapped into a force that transcended racial and generational divides, and often party lines. Carterâ€™s appreciation for all genres of music and friendships with the likes of Bob Dylan, Gregg Allman, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, and Willie Nelson helped to define his administration. 

"I cannot think of a better recommendation for this time," Mary says, "this day, this moment in history, for you to watch and feel hopeful and charmed and believe in the goodness of government."
