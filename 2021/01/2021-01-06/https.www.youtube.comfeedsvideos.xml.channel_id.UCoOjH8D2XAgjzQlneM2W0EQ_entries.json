The thought of Silicon Valley being a giant ponzi scheme never really crosses your mind. And that\u2019s perhaps exactly why Silicon Valley has grown to be perhaps one of the biggest ponzi schemes in human history.\n\nIt all starts with an idea, a new app, a new platform. A disruptive idea that will for sure turn this industry upside down. So the founder manages to get the startup going but they run into a problem. Their revolutionary idea needs a lot more up-front capital to get to the next stage. Luckily, that\u2019s where the Venture Capital firms, or VC\u2019s for short come in.\n\nYou come in and say \u201cwe wanna partner with you, you\u2019re awesome, we backed this company\u201d. You are what amounts to a fund manager who knows a lot of rich people. In exchange for a fee, Investors hand the VC firm money to be locked up in a fund for 10 years or more. So, if you raise a $100m fund, you\u2019re guaranteed to make a minimum of $17m.\n\nGrow super fast. The founders take the millions you gave them and shove it into things like Facebook ads, Instagram ads, YouTube ads, Amazon services. Basically, you want them to do whatever it takes to \u201cgrow\u201d on paper. VC firms tell startups to not run at a profit.\n\nRunning out of money! So a year or so passes by and the founders have spent all your money. The startup you picked grew their user base by 400%! So you go back to the board meeting and say \u201chey guys, good job, but if we wanna keep this train going we\u2019re gonna need to raise more money\u201d Then they tell their buddies \u201clook at the growth, you should invest in B\u201d.\n\nThe Series B round, the second funding round a startup goes through is logically called the Series B. Series B money goes into FB, Goog, Amzn, buying more unprofitable growth, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s sustainable, you\u2019ve been told to grow.\n\nRun out of money + Series C. So your friend, VC Bob, shows off their \u201creturns\u201d to his friends at another VC firm, and they raise a few more millions for the Series C funding round completing Step 7. And throughout all these funding rounds, since all the VC firms are buddy-buddy, they can value these companies at whatever valuation they want! \n\nLook like a genius. That means on paper to your investment had a 4x ROI!\n\nSo for step 9, you start a second fund to invest in more startups, to have more money under management, collecting those management fees, starting the process all over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
