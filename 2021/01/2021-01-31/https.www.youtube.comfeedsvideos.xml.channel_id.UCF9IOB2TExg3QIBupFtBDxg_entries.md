Fever threshold

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/fever-and-temperature

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.21250480v1

Uninfected volunteers (twins), n = 1,089

Hospitalised, n = 1,227

Community based positives, n = 3,972

Results 

Among unaffected volunteers

Lower BMI (p=0.001), and older age (p less than 0.001) associated with lower basal temperature

Basal temperature showed a heritability of 47%

In COVID-19+ participants

Increasing age associated with lower temperatures (p less than 0.001)

For each additional year of age, participants were 1% less likely to demonstrate a fever

Ageing affects temperature in health and acute infection

Older people with COVID-19 were also less likely to have a fever reaching 37.8°C

Current health guidelines, 37.8°C or more should self-isolate

Using a threshold of 37.4°C for over 65s is as sensitive and specific a sign of infection as 37.8°C in adults under 65

Novavax trial, Previous infection did not provide full immunity to B.1.351

https://www.novavax.com/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-updates

Efficacy against old strain = 95.6% 

Efficacy against UK variant = 85.6% 

Efficacy against SA variant = 60% 

United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil all in US

U.K. variant, B.1.1.7, 430 cases

Jay Butler, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

If a more transmissible strain becomes dominant, herd immunity, 80 to 85 %

Marc Lipsitch, Harvard, School of Public Health

We will not be for decades dealing with a pandemic

The concern is whether it will be a year or three years until we can make enough vaccines against enough strains to get this under control

Thank you very much Dr. Tom Robb, this is a most valuable contribution.

What's your risk of COVID hospitalisation?

Predictions based on data from the first wave data

Simple charts, nomograms, to identify risk of severely illness

Requiring oxygen and other treatments

Factors

Number of symptoms experienced over the first five days of illness

Sex and age

Symptoms

Loss of smell (anosmia)

High temperature (fever)

Persistent cough

Severe tiredness (fatigue)

Headache

Abdominal pain

Chest pain

Sore throat

Severe shortness of breath

Skipping meals

How to use this information 

Medical professionals and the public

Identifying people with COVID, who might be most likely to need medical care

Monitored appropriately and get to hospital quickly should it become necessary

If you’re in the red or dark red zone you should contact your doctor for advice

Ask if they can send you a pulse oximeter

Check HR and temp regularly

Wherever you fall on the chart, 

if you are struggling to breathe, 

have pain in your chest, 

become very confused or drowsy

or your lips or face are turning blue, 

you should call an ambulance
