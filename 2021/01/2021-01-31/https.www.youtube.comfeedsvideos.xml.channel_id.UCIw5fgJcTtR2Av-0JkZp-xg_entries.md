Here's the instrumental live looping jam of You Sonofa...
I decided to leave out the vocals, just to try an instrumental for once.

Equipment used:
- Elektron Octatrack MkII
- Korg Minilogue
- 1010 Blackbox
- Korg Microkorg XL+
- Korg Nanokey Studio
- Roland JU06
- Gibson LPJ
- Singular Sound Aeros Loop Studio
- iConnect MioXM

Music-nerd stuff:
This jam is DAWless. All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.
The master clock signal comes from a Disaster Area MidiBaby, which acts as tap tempo so I can just tap out the tempo that I want to jam in by feel, rather than follow a number. The master clock signal is then distributed by the Octatrack through the MioXM.
The Octatrack is sending a MIDI arp sequence to the Microkorg, since the Microkorg itself doesn't have a arp step sequencer by itself.
The rest of the instruments (Minilogue, JU06, Guitar) are sampled and played back by the Octatrack via Flex Machines.
The 1010 Blackbox supplies the drum samples, and all the instruments go through the Octatrack, so they can be effected (eq/filtered mostly) with the cross fader.
The Aeros loop studio is a fantastic looper and is clocked to the Octatrack/MidiBaby, but not used for this jam since I don't have the need to overdub. It would be perfect for making looping overdubs like percussion stuff and harmonies. It is still connected and running though, as you can see from the screen.
