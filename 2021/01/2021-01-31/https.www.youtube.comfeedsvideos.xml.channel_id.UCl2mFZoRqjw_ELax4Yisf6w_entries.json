The person they linked me to was /u/laminar_flo , someone who had provided a very complete and accurate take on the mess with the CMBS issue last year when discussing NYC real estate. I learned a lot from this so I wanted to share his perspective on everything that has been going on. \n\nSeveral of you realized other users were posting identical stuff and pinging each other back and forth, which made it seemed like astroturfing using alt accounts to bolster the reputation of what was being said. The moment you realized this and called /u/shark_bones out for reposting the material, he deleted his entire post history. This made me highly suspicious of everything being said. https://imgur.com/gallery/DKm7Szo\n\nWhen he got called out on it, he deleted the account. https://i.imgur.com/cXUm92u.png https://i.imgur.com/ZixNFxH.png and he just autodeleted all his stuff. Someone caught him on it right before he did it. See below.\n\nIf he is correct in his viewpoint, I am unsure the point in people astroturfing it across several accounts and then deleting it when being found it. This makes me wonder if this is FUD entirely. However, I will leave this up for you all to decide what you think of the post, WITH THE DISCLAIMER TO TAKE THIS WITH A SERIOUS GRAIN OF SALT DUE TO THE MANNER WITHIN WHICH THIS CONTENT WAS BEING POSTED.\n\nHere is more stuff to go on. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l9pr43/zuckerberg_mad_that_apple_is_protecting_its/glkku5e?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\nIhttps://imgur.com/gallery/DKm7Szo\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QnNgeZo.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DOdtrI0.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nnWKuj0.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cXUm92u.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZixNFxH.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QdefU32.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QnNgeZo.png\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/DKm7Szo\n\n\n------\nHere are the links to the posts I had read in my prior video from laminar_flo that you said matched shark_bones.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l6i0cs/wall_street_bets_taken_down/gl0yyx0/?context=3\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l6i0cs/wall_street_bets_taken_down/gl1neet/?context=3\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/l7wbvd/billionaire_blasts_robinhood_market_as_jon/glb98vx/?context=3\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/l855yk/meme_stock_rally_rescues_amc_theaters_from_600m/glbbl52/?context=3\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/l855yk/meme_stock_rally_rescues_amc_theaters_from_600m/glbfrr7/?context=3\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/l855yk/meme_stock_rally_rescues_amc_theaters_from_600m/glbgz9w/?context=3\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/l7wbvd/billionaire_blasts_robinhood_market_as_jon/glbqlpo/?context=3\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/l855yk/meme_stock_rally_rescues_amc_theaters_from_600m/glbsen0/?context=3\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/l7wbvd/billionaire_blasts_robinhood_market_as_jon/glbsyu2/?context=3\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/l7wbvd/billionaire_blasts_robinhood_market_as_jon/glcbtxi/?context=3\n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/l7wbvd/billionaire_blasts_robinhood_market_as_jon/glioerh/?context=3\n\n\nWe are not financial services or investment professionals and this is not investment advice.
