They started the round second behind Exeter, winning their first three matches before being awarded the fourth and they were unfortunate to leave here with nothing after forcing Bristol to plunder their deep reserves. It is little wonder that some of the Premiership\u2019s more established brethren are trying to use the pandemic as an excuse to pull up the trap-door marked relegation.</p><p>The Falcons took the game to Bristol from the start even if their first attack ended with the Bears scoring when Tom Arscott\u2019s off-balance pass was picked off by Callum Sheedy on his 10-metre line for Ratu Naulago to score. Bristol had a potent back division with Charles Piutau, playing his first match for three months, Siva Naulago and Semi Radradra in harness for the first time, but they were underpowered at forward and spent much of the first half in retreat as they gave away penalties under pressure, so many that Dave Attwood was sent to the sin-bin after 30 minutes.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jan/01/bristol-newcastle-premiership-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jan/01/bristol-newcastle-premiership-match-report", "date_published": "2021-01-01 17:12:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Journalist dies in Afghanistan as targeted killings continue", "description": "<p>Violence increases amid stalled Taliban peace talks, with Isis claiming it was behind earlier journalist killing<br /></p><p>An Afghan journalist and human rights activist has been shot and killed by unidentified gunmen in western Afghanistan, the fifth journalist to be killed in the war-ravaged country in the past two months, a provincial spokesman said.</p><p>Bismillah Adil Aimaq was on the road near Feroz Koh, the provincial capital of Ghor, returning home to the city after visiting his family in a village nearby, when gunmen opened fire at the vehicle.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/01/journalist-dies-in-afghanistan-as-targeted-killings-continue\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/01/journalist-dies-in-afghanistan-as-targeted-killings-continue", "date_published": "2021-01-01 17:06:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "MF Doom: a hip-hop genius who built his own universe of poetry", "description": "<p>The underground rap icon, who has died aged 49, was a voice like no other, plundering and splicing pop culture to deliver wilful, elliptical lines</p><p>It makes twisted sense that we\u2019re only learning of the death of Daniel Dumile, better known as MF Doom, two months after his passing, with scant accompanying detail.

By the age of six, I was reading braille at an unheard-of speed, to the point where the teacher at my blind school accused me of lying when I said I had finished the three books she had given me that morning. It was the start of a lifelong problem: braille books were scarce, but I could not get enough of them.</p><p>The school had devised a particularly cruel and subtle form of torture for someone like me: they kept just one title of a child\u2019s favourite author in the school library; for example, just one Famous Five book, one Billy Bunter, one Just William. As I grew older and my tastes changed, the problem remained the same: one Raymond Chandler, one PG Wodehouse, just one even mildly dirty book when puberty hit.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/01/no-one-can-read-50-books-a-week-so-why-was-i-buying-or-borrowing-that-many\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/01/no-one-can-read-50-books-a-week-so-why-was-i-buying-or-borrowing-that-many", "date_published": "2021-01-01 07:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "10 good news stories for UK travel and tourism in 2021", "description": "<p>From cleaner rivers to greener cities and community projects, there are signs the industry will come out of lockdown travelling in the right direction</p><p>Amid all the challenges, last year\u2019s forced pause sent some hopeful ripples across the travel industry.
