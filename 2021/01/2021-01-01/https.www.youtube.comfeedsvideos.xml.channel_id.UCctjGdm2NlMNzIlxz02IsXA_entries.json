Happy New Year, everyone!\n\nLast year sucked. Popular opinion, I know, but that's because it's true. We're all getting older, the world's getting more and more unpredictable, and Snapple refused to admit that glass bottles taste better. But at least we have each other to guide us through the harrowing darkness. So let's take a look back at 2020, the good, the bad, and ugly. My first musical was to the tune of \"We Didn't Start The Fire,\" but I genuinely can't think of a year more deserving of a version of it's own. \n\nHope you enjoy! I'll be making more of these this year. Stay tuned, babycakes. That's your nickname now, babycakes. Why are you still reading this? I'm not some novelist here to wax your cerebrum with whimsical words and rambunctious tales of a yesteryear long since past. Get some help, creep. \n\nSHIRTS \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/chris-ray-gun\r\nTWITTER \u25ba https://twitter.com/ChrisRGun\r\nFACEBOOK \u25ba http://on.fb.me/15OyE7z\r\nTWITCH \u25ba http://www.twitch.tv/chrisraygun\r\nPATREON \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/ChrisRay\r\nSUBREDDIT \u25ba https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisRayGun/\r\nSACRED SYMBOLS  \u25ba https://apple.co/2Rqmklc\r\nSECOND CHANNEL \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiNediqB-JC_TjbsB4hJuHA", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE00AYkkYhc", "date_published": "2021-01-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
