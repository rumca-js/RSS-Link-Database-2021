Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | January 19, 2021\nIf Gabriel Garz\u00f3n-Montano's solo Tiny Desk back in 2017 was an exercise in restraint and vulnerability, his home set is the polar opposite. It beams ingenuity and unveils multiple layers, figuratively and literally. Taking advantage of of the rare opportunity to gather musicians in quarantine times, he says \"It's like being a child who's allowed to do what they always wanted to do when they didn't wanna get up for school, and it's also felt like an adult who didn't know what to do at 3 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon. I'm focusing on oscillating between those states with ease.\"\n\nThat sounds like the same approach he applied to his latest album, last year's genre-snubbing Ag\u00fcita. In this performance he brought the full band, sporting all white from mask to toe and bringing to life all the sonics we hear on the record. Garz\u00f3n-Montano morphs into three different characters from Ag\u00fcita and stretches the boundaries even more, adding salsa flavor to \"Mu\u00f1eca\" and delivering some bonus bars on the set opener, \"With A Smile.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"With A Smile\"\n\"Mu\u00f1eca\"\n\"Tombs\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nGabriel Garz\u00f3n-Montano: vocals, guitar, piano\nLenny \"The Ox\": drums\nNicholas Semrad\" Wurlitzer, synth\nJustin \"Jhawk\" Hawkins: guitar, synth\nItai Shapira: bass, synth, guitar\nGracie Sprout: harp\nDaniel Rodriguez: drums, percussion\nKROMA Quartet: strings\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: July Holdings, Tommy Nowels\nAudio: Ed McEntee, Brittney Orinda, Josh Pleeter\nAssistant Producers: Jackson Perry, Stephanie Hanson\nDirector of Photography: Andrew Fronczak\nProduction Designer: Greg Yaro\nSpecial Thanks: Gold Diggers Sound, Andrekza, Jagjaguwar and Esteban Cortazar\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle Smith\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMN99gLK424", "date_published": "2021-01-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Nora Brown: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "Every January, I attend globalFEST at a New York City nightclub and see some of the most fantastic music I'll experience all year. Now, given the pandemic's challenges and the hardening of international borders, NPR Music and globalFEST moved the 2021 edition from the nightclub to your screen of choice and shared the festival with the world. We called it Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST. We presented 16 artists in intimate settings (often behind desks donning globes) representing more than a dozen countries.\n\nThirty feet below the surface in Brooklyn, 10th grader Nora Brown brings incredible, surprising depth to the Appalachian music she plays. Over the course of her Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST concert, surrounded by innumerable globes and instruments, she infuses new life and energy into the traditional songs of Addie Graham, Virgil Anderson and Fred Cockerham. Nora weaves together songs and storytelling, speaking of the great history of the music that came before her and at which she excels. This performance took place on the second night of our 2021 festival. --globalFEST\n\nSET LIST\n\"The Very Day I'm Gone\"\n\"Miner's Dream\"\n\"Little Satchel\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNora Brown: vocals, banjo\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Nora Brown\nProducer: Benton Brown\nVideo: Benton Brown\nAudio: Joseph \"joebass\" DeJarnette at Studio808A\nPost Supervisor: Peter McCabe Pictures\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nGLOBALFEST TEAM\n\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, and Bill Bragin\n2021 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, and Viviana Benitez\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nHost: Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo\nSocial Media Manager: Valerie French\nPublicity: Brendan Gilmartin, Chart Room Media\nLegal Services: Tamizdat\nLegal Services: Duane Morris\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film\nVideo Production: MODEMA Studios", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxjyFQS2nIY", "date_published": "2021-01-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
