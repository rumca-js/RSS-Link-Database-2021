D\n\nhttps://vitamindforall.org/letter.html\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00513/full\n\nVitamin D modulates thousands of genes and many aspects of immune function, both innate and adaptive. \n\nHigher vitamin D blood levels are associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. \n\n\nHigher D levels are associated with lower risk of a severe case (hospitalization, ICU, or death). \n\nIntervention studies (including RCTs) indicate that vitamin D can be a very effective treatment. \n\nMany papers reveal several biological mechanisms by which vitamin D influences COVID-19. \n\nCausal inference modelling, Hill\u2019s criteria, the intervention studies & the biological mechanisms indicate that vitamin D\u2019s influence on COVID-19 is very likely causal, not just correlation.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3849fI4yIeo", "date_published": "2021-01-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source":

United States of America \n\nCurrent situation \n\nEffective R, greater than 1 in 27 states\n\nEffective R is less than 1 in most of the midwest\n\nEstimated, 22% have been infected as of January 11\n\nUS population, 328 million\n\nTherefore number of infections = 72,160,000\n\nFactor of 3 more\n\nTherefore IFR = 0.48%\n\nCFR = 1,67%\n\nTrends\n\nDeaths, 567,000 by May 1\n\nThis represents 192,000 additional deaths from January 11 to May 1\n\nLikely peak at the beginning of February\n\nDaily deaths will peak at 3,680 on February 1, 2021\n\nSteady decline after the peak\n\nReaching below 500 a day sometime in April\n\nFactors, seasonality and the scale-up of vaccination\n\nBy May 1, some states may be close to herd immunity\n\nIf more transmissible variants spread in the US in the coming weeks\n\nPeak could be delayed by weeks\n\nDeath toll substantially increased\n\nHospitals in many states will be under severe stress in the next four weeks\n\nTo reduce deaths, masks, some social distancing mandates, rapid scale-up of vaccination\n\nDrivers and prevention\n\nMobility continues to decline, 33% lower than the pre-COVID-19 baseline\n\nVisits to restaurants and department stores up substantially from the weeks prior.\n\nAs of January 11, 76% of people always wore a mask when leaving their home\n\nAll states had mask use over 50%. \n\nUS, 52.5% of people say they would accept a vaccine, 24.1% unsure\n\nWe expect, 141 to 179 million people will be vaccinated by May 1\n\nProjections \n\nBy May 1, 2021, we project that 37,800 to 51,100 lives will be saved by the vaccine rollout\n\nCompared to a no-vaccine scenario\n\nIf universal mask coverage (95%), 31,000 fewer cumulative deaths on May 1, 2021\n\nMandates easing scenario, 621,000 cumulative deaths on May 1, 2021\n\nJanuary to May, 42 states will have high or extreme stress on hospital beds\n\nJanuary to May, 45 states will have high or extreme stress on ICU capacity\n\n\nEmergence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7
