When you go into a hospital, this is very, very bad at the moment

with enormous pressure and in some cases it looks like a war zone in terms of the things that people are having to deal with

Vaccines are not doing enough heavy lifting

Secondary school testing

Plans for the daily testing instead of isolation on pause

Public Health England (PHE) and NHS Test and Trace

The balance between the risks and benefits of a daily testing programme in schools was now unclear

Mr Drakeford

There will be no point and certainly it will be logistically very damaging to try to use all of that in the first week and then to have all our vaccinators standing around with nothing to do with for another month

Dr. Rochelle Walensky

Infectious diseases specialist at Harvard Medical School

Currently deployed Covid-19 vaccines should still work against the new variants

However, the more-contagious strains might reduce how effectively the vaccines perform

Dr. Walensky expects total of 500,000 COVID-19 deaths by mid-February

Tens of thousands, recovered uncharacterized syndrome

U.S. has not yet seen the ramifications of what happened from the holiday travel

Will lead to high rates of hospitalizations and deaths thereafter

I think we still have some dark weeks ahead

no evidence of harm resulting from vaccination during the entire pregnancy

In pregnant women who become infected and fall ill with the coronavirus, there is a higher incidence of a severe onset of the disease, than in a similar age population

Open letter on Vitamin D

https://vitamindforall.org/letter.html
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00513/full

Vitamin D modulates thousands of genes and many aspects of immune function, both innate and adaptive. 

Higher vitamin D blood levels are associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 


Higher D levels are associated with lower risk of a severe case (hospitalization, ICU, or death). 

Intervention studies (including RCTs) indicate that vitamin D can be a very effective treatment. 

Many papers reveal several biological mechanisms by which vitamin D influences COVID-19. 

Causal inference modelling, Hill’s criteria, the intervention studies & the biological mechanisms indicate that vitamin D’s influence on COVID-19 is very likely causal, not just correlation.

COVID-19 Results Briefing: United States of America 

Current situation 

Effective R, greater than 1 in 27 states

Effective R is less than 1 in most of the midwest

Estimated, 22% have been infected as of January 11

US population, 328 million

Therefore number of infections = 72,160,000

Factor of 3 more

Therefore IFR = 0.48%

CFR = 1,67%

Trends

Deaths, 567,000 by May 1

This represents 192,000 additional deaths from January 11 to May 1

Likely peak at the beginning of February

Daily deaths will peak at 3,680 on February 1, 2021

Steady decline after the peak

Reaching below 500 a day sometime in April

Factors, seasonality and the scale-up of vaccination

By May 1, some states may be close to herd immunity

If more transmissible variants spread in the US in the coming weeks

Peak could be delayed by weeks

Death toll substantially increased

Hospitals in many states will be under severe stress in the next four weeks

To reduce deaths, masks, some social distancing mandates, rapid scale-up of vaccination

Drivers and prevention

Mobility continues to decline, 33% lower than the pre-COVID-19 baseline

Visits to restaurants and department stores up substantially from the weeks prior.

As of January 11, 76% of people always wore a mask when leaving their home

All states had mask use over 50%. 

US, 52.5% of people say they would accept a vaccine, 24.1% unsure

We expect, 141 to 179 million people will be vaccinated by May 1

Projections 

By May 1, 2021, we project that 37,800 to 51,100 lives will be saved by the vaccine rollout

Compared to a no-vaccine scenario

If universal mask coverage (95%), 31,000 fewer cumulative deaths on May 1, 2021

Mandates easing scenario, 621,000 cumulative deaths on May 1, 2021

January to May, 42 states will have high or extreme stress on hospital beds

January to May, 45 states will have high or extreme stress on ICU capacity

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e2.htm?s_cid=mm7003e2_w


Detected in 10 U.S. states

Potential to increase the U.S. pandemic trajectory in the coming months

Increased transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 variant

Warrants universal and increased compliance with mitigation strategies

Higher vaccination coverage might need to be achieved to protect the public
