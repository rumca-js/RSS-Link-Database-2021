how long protection lasts. \n\nCrucially, we believe people may still be able to pass the virus on.\n\nyou can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections\n\nbut there is still a risk that you could acquire an infection and transmit to others.\n\nNow more than ever it is vital we all stay at home to protect our health service and save lives.\n\nPrior to
