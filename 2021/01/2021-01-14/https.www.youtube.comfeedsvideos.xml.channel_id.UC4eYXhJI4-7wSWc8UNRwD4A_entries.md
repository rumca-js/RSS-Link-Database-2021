The Tiny Desk is teaming up with globalFEST this year for a thrilling virtual music festival: Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST. The online fest includes four nights of concerts featuring 16 bands from all over the world. From Monday, Jan. 11, through Thursday, Jan. 14, we'll be streaming new performances at 8 p.m. ET on NPR Music's YouTube channel and NPR.org.

Every January, I attend globalFEST at a New York City nightclub and see some of the most fantastic music I'll experience all year. Now, given the pandemic's challenges and the hardening of international borders, NPR Music and globalFEST is moving from the nightclub to your screen of choice and sharing this festival with the world. Each night, we'll present four artists in intimate settings (often behind desks donning globes), and it's all hosted by African superstar Angélique Kidjo, who performed at the inaugural edition of globalFEST in 2004.

For the final night of Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST, we have Edwin Perez's presentation of salsa dura, First Nations advocate and singer-songwriter Elisapie performing in Montreal, 15-year-old Appalachian banjo player Nora Brown, and globalFEST alum Rokia Traoré performing from Mali.

0:00 INTRO
2:26 EDWIN PEREZ
21:43 ELISAPIE
38:23 NORA BROWN
53:08 ROKIA TRAORÉ

Below you'll find short descriptions about each act, written by the globalFEST team.

EDWIN PEREZ
From the basement of the Bowery Electric in downtown Manhattan, composer and vocalist Edwin Perez and his 10-piece band come together to put on a show. With a strong backbeat and enough room to move around, Perez's up-tempo energy brings the party and keeps it going. The theme of the night is salsa dura music, which originated in New York in the 1970s and gained acclaim thanks to acts like the Fania All-Stars and Spanish Harlem Orchestra.

SET LIST
"La Salsa Que Me Crió"
"No Puedo Respirar" (I Can't Breathe)
"Mi Tierra"

ELISAPIE
Elisapie returns to Tiny Desk for a show-stopping performance from Montreal, with the disco globe of our dreams helping to light her set. Elisapie, in both her songs and work, is a resounding advocate of First Nations culture in Canada. In her set, she harnesses an incredible energy with electrifying, emotive vocals.

SET LIST
"Qanniuguma"
"Wolves Don't Live by the Rules"
"Arnaq"

NORA BROWN
30 feet below the surface in Brooklyn, 10th grader Nora Brown brings incredible, surprising depth to the Appalachian music she plays. Over the course of her Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST concert, surrounded by innumerable globes and instruments, she infuses new life and energy into the traditional songs of Addie Graham, Virgil Anderson and Fred Cockerham. Nora weaves together songs and storytelling, speaking of the great history of the music that came before her and at which she excels.

SET LIST
"The Very Day I'm Gone"
"Miner's Dream"
"Little Satchel"

ROKIA TRAORÉ
Rokia Traoré performed at globalFEST in 2005, the music festival's second year, and it's a thrill to present her meditative performance as part of Tiny Desk meets globalFEST. Her work is rooted in the Malian musical tradition, but defies the confines of a single culture. Born in Mali to a diplomat father, Traoré had a nomadic upbringing that exposed her to a wide variety of international musical influences. She joins us from Blues Faso, a theater inside her Foundation Passerelle in Mali, which she created to support emerging, interdisciplinary artists, from music and the performing arts to visual arts and photography.

SET LIST
"Souba Lé"
"Tiramakan"
"Fakoly"

## mxmtoon: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

January 15, 2021 | Bob Boilen
"Hi, I'm mxmtoon, and I'm doing my Tiny Desk at the world's biggest desk!" And so it begins, from an eerily empty New York City office building, mxmtoon sings songs filled with dreams and anxieties. Much of the music comes from her recent 2020 EPs, Dawn and Dusk. Those EPs included collaborations with Carly Rae Jepsen and Tune-Yards' Merrill Garbus. For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, her sweet voice and ukulele are accompanied by Nicole Wakabayashi on piano and Cale Hawkins on guitar.

It's been almost two years now since we first played the Oakland-based mxmtoon on All Songs Considered. She was just 18 then, singing about crying in her "prom dress" (which I'm thrilled she is performing here). Her melodies are simple, with the words up front mighty and personal. One of the first songs she released is called "Feelings Are Fatal," which she also performs. It's a candid song about emotions and why we're often afraid to share them. It's a model for what mxmtoon does so well: humble, honest songs, sung here behind a massive desk.

SET LIST
"Fever Dream"
"Prom Dress"
"Feelings Are Fatal"
"Wallflower"
"Bon Iver"

MUSICIANS
mxmtoon: vocals, ukulele
Nicole Wakabayashi: piano
Cale Hawkins: guitar

Below you’ll find short descriptions about each act, written by the globalFEST team.

VOX SAMBOU
There are few performers as “alive” as Vox Sambou, whose energy and soul transcends the virtual space. He starts his performance at Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST with a short moment between himself and his son, overseen by a painting of his mother, highlighting the ways we pass down traditions from generation to generation. Based in Montreal, Quebec, Vox Sambou writes and performs in Hatian-Creole, French, English, Spanish and Portuguese. His music is a joyous fusion of Haitian funk, reggae and hip-hop. 

SET LIST
"African Diaspora"
"My Rhythm" 
"Everyone"

ADITYA PRAKASH ENSEMBLE
Performing from their home base in Los Angeles, Aditya Prakash Ensemble highlights songs borne from South India's Carnatic tradition. Aditya uses his voice as an instrument to tell powerful, emotive stories -- which he reimagines in a fresh, dynamic way.  Aditya Prakash Ensemble’s modern take on traditional music mixes in jazz and hip-hop and features a diverse L.A. ensemble.

SET LIST
"Greenwood"
"Vasheebava" 
"Payoji"

RACHELE ANDRIOLI
Recording from southern Italy, Rachele Andrioli’s performance highlights her mix of old and new, of traditional music and modern technology. Her trance vocals and loop pedals create a sound all her own, mixing music from Italian, Indian, Lebanese, Albanian and Romani cultures and traditions.

SET LIST
"Te Spettu"
"Pranvera Filloi Me Ardh"
"Ederlezi"

MARTHA REDBONE
https://www.martharedbone.com/
Martha Redbone performs her Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST performance from her home studio in Brooklyn’s Navy Yards. Native and African-American singer-songwriter Martha Redbone is known for her mix of folk, blues and gospel from her childhood in Harlan County, Ky., which she  infuses with the eclectic grit of pre-gentrified Brooklyn. Inheriting the powerful vocal range of her gospel-singing African-American father and the resilient spirit of her mother’s Cherokee, Shawnee and Choctaw culture, Redbone broadens the boundaries of American Roots music. 

SET LIST
"The Garden of Love"
"Talk About It"
"Underdog"
