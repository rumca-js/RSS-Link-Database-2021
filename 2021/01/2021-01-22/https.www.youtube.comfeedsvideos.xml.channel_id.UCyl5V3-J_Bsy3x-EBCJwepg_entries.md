Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, Kyle and Ethan talk about the week’s biggest stories like Skynet being a private company so their Terminator robots can do whatever they want to you, Democratic states are suddenly following the science on lockdowns, and how the right is learning from the left’s past four years on how to cope when they feel like the president is not their president. There’s weird news, glorious hate mail, and Kyle can’t say the word “dang.”
