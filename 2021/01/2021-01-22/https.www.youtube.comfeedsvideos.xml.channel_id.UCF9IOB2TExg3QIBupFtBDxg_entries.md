Without this variant, we would be in really good shape

If you just look at the reproduction number, you just wouldn’t see that it was in growth underneath at all

Dominant strain of the virus, by mid-February

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, B.1.1.7 could be prevalent by March

Daily coronavirus cases in Denmark could quadruple by the beginning of April

Tyra Grove Krause, Scientific Director, sequencing institute

This period is going to be a bit like a tsunami

Mathematicians comparing death rates

It's largely the impact of this new variant that means the NHS is under such intense pressure

R = 0.8 – 1.0

Realistic possibility that the virus had become more deadly, but this is far from certain

Patrick Vallance

There is evidence that there's an increased risk for those who have the new variant

New variant spreads between 30% and 70% faster

Hints it is about 30% more deadly

For example, with 1,000 60-year-olds infected

Re – WHO

You had the authority, you had the ability to challenge China, 

to question China as to what they were doing, and you needed to do that for global health

You failed to do it

An independent panel

https://theindependentpanel.org

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/independent-pandemic-review-panel-critical-china-who-delays-n1254598

Criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) for not declaring an international emergency until Jan. 30.

Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark

Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf

What is clear to the Panel is that public health measures could have been applied more forcefully by local and national health authorities in China in January

As evidence emerged of human-to-human transmission, in far too many countries, this signal was ignored

Although the term pandemic is neither used nor defined in the International Health Regulations (2005), 

WHO first uses the P word, 11th March

its use does serve to focus attention on the gravity of a health event. 

The panel called for a global reset

Make recommendations in a final report to health ministers from the WHO's 194 member states in May

Government of Canada has purchased more vaccines per capita than anyone

Supplies temporarily been halted by Pfizer, as they expand their facilities in Belgium
