Here is an updated video as promised of my Valve index after 2000 hours and about a year and a half of usage. I have been through a lot and I have learned a lot about the index and how to make it last a long time, so buckle up and enjoy!\n\nBTW, im super sorry, this this video took me way longer to do than normal, Im using multiple different camera setups with different lighting etc, definitely is not my best video ever, but It will get better.
