Seems like the death of Flash is finally real. The older plugin had already been reviled and cast out since smartphones started poking their noses and creating a mobile web, but now, most if not all browsers have officially dropped support for it, including Firefox.

Nvidia released a new version of their stable driver for Linux, which is nothing special, except that this new release supports the Vulkan ray tracing API. This drivers supports a lot of Vulkan ray tracing extensions, and should improve performance as they increased the OpenGL and Vulkan shader disk cache, which means that there will be less need to rebuild these shaders on the fly. Still no news on the support of the necessary vulkan extension for Cyberpunk 2077, though.
