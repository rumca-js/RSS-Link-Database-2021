10 days\n\n30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms\n\n75% of these are as infectious as symptomatics\n\nProportions of transmissions\n\nFrom infected people who never develop symptoms, 24% of all transmission\n\nFrom presymptomatics, 35% of all transmission\n\nTherefore 59% of all transmission\n\nTherefore 41% of all transmission from symptomatics\n\nConclusions and
