Curfew riots

9 pm to 4.30 am

Bars and restaurants closed since October

Schools and non-essential shops shut since December

Cases going down

National Institute for Health (RIVM) warned another new variant powered wave

Filipa in Portugal

The situation in Portugal is horrible

We are now in lockdown but until last week the Government insisted in keeping schools open... 

We are staying at home for a year working from home because I never trusted our numbers. 

And yet the planes keep coming and the Hospitals at 300 per cent occupation rate.

We have concern about the mutation that’s in South Africa

It is clearly different and more ominous than the one in the U.K.

Mr. Biden

1.5 million per day

I think with the grace of God . . . we’ll be able to get that to 1.5 million a day

(Now close to 1 million per day)

By spring, everyone who wants a vaccine should be able to get one.

It’s going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we’ve ever tried in this country, but I think we can do that

I feel confident that by summer we’re going to be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity. I feel good about where we’re going, and I think we can get it done

We will still be talking about this into the summer

We’re still going to be dealing with this issue in the early fall

Death toll could rise to 600,000 or even 660,000

CDC

The CDC has reached out to UK officials and is reviewing their new mortality data associated with variant B.1.1.7

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/23/health/uk-variant-cdc-review/index.html

Only 195 cases so far, but in 22 states
 
Many more cases are going undetected

California and Florida

Michael Osterholm, Epidemiologist, Coronavirus transition team

Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, University of Minnesota

From public and non-public data, convinced that the new variant is deadlier

The data is mounting -- and some of it I can't share -- that clearly supports that B.1.1.7 is causing more severe illness and increased death

Already we know this variant has increased transmission, and so this is more very bad news

President Biden, impose a ban on most non-U.S. citizens entering the country who have recently been in South Africa

High-transmission variants in Canada

January 25, 2021 

What happens if a high-transmission variant becomes established, and is transmitted in the general community in Canada? 

http://www.sfu.ca/magpie/blog/high-transmission-variant-modelling.html

Trajectory we may see, higher-transmission variant

B.1.1.7, 40-80% increase in the reproduction number

Variant with a 40+% increase in transmission rate, likely would not be contained with current measures

What does it mean?

Failure to prevent or contain this now spells disaster in March. 

While we don't see much impact for ~6 weeks

when it comes it comes steeply,

doubling time of 1-2 weeks

(Current about 30-40 days recently in provinces like Ontario)

Exponential growth

When you're halfway to the maximum capacity you can tolerate, you only have one doubling time left.
But it might have taken 8 doubling times to get to halfway

So what can we do? 

Few detected B.1.1.7 cases already in Canada, (hope that community spread has not yet been established)

Prevent introductions of new variants into Canada

Step up quarantine and isolation of travellers

Improve detection

Be willing to act to curtail the spread of high-transmission variants already in Canada

If and when we find out that COVID-19 vaccines can impact transmission -- and we think it is likely that they will -- we could 

Use vaccination as one of the tools in the transmission toolkit, e.g. truckers, Canada/US border

Reduce travel within Canada

Consider screening domestic travellers

Vaccination is not going to impact transmission in the 6-8 week time frame 

Does homeopathy have a role in preventing and treating CoViD?

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/24/homeopaths-have-crossed-line-peddling-dangerous-vaccine-myths/

A FB post, dated January 5, diluted duck heart and liver extract, had been distributed to 953,416 families

The Covid-19 prevention study received spectacular results in one million people

viable modality in the treatment of Covid-19

coronavirus as a unique opportunity to use the current crisis for strengthening the foundations of 
homeopathy

Professor Stephen Powis, NHS medical director

It's one thing for homeopaths to peddle useless but harmless potions, 
but they cross a dangerous line when making ridiculous assertions about protecting people from Covid infection.

We urge everyone to ignore misleading claims and get vital protection against Covid when they are invited for their vaccine
