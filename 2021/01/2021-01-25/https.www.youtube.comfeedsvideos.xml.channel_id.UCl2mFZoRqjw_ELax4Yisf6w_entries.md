To be clear, I disagree with a lot of the people posting there and some of the investing decisions I see made there are insane. They have actually deleted posts I've made with suggestions that would've helped people not FOMO & make more money. This is not an endorsement of WSB, but an explanation of why the people criticizing them in bad faith are full of shit, in my opinion.
