It's popular with local archeologists (both ameteur \"treasure hunters\" and professionals) as they wade through New York City's past. \n \nBut this year, a darker side of the city's history has emerged: traces of radon gas and gamma radiation exceeding ambient levels. As parts of the beach have been closed off, locals are worried: will their artifacts and their history now just wash out to sea? And when trash becomes treasured, do we have a responsibility to preserve it? \n\n\nDrone footage courtesy of Justin Brooks.
