But when it comes down to it, the energy of the future is going to be the cheapest energy. So in this video we compare energy production by the Levelized Cost of Energy, or LCOE - the formula that will determine our energy future.\n\nSome of the main sources for this video include:\n\nhttps://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf\n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/08/f25/LCOE.pdf\n\nhttps://openei.org/apps/TCDB/#blank\n\nWant to support the channel?
