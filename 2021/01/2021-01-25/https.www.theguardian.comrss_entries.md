Like many late millennials, I grew up a fan of the books – more accurately, I grew up <em>with</em> the books, from some of my earliest reading memories through the time I literally crashed my car while listening to the sixth installment on tape for the fourth time. But my appetite for wizarding content has waned over the last eight years or so, as unquestioned Potter standom (self-proclaimed Gryffindors and Slytherins) soured into generational parody, creator JK Rowling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/08/daniel-radcliffe-jk-rowling-transgender-tweets">doubled down</a> on her <a href="https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/">transphobic views</a>, and the Potterverse expansion seemed less interested in the earnest fun of fan culture – the midnight premieres, the trivia board games, the rangy wikis – than the consistent wringing out of a highly lucrative franchise for paced output.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/03/harry-potter-fan-sites-distance-themselves-from-jk-rowling-over-transgender-rights">Harry Potter fan sites distance themselves from JK Rowling over transgender rights</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/25/harry-potter-tv-series-hbo-max">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scotland’s moves towards independence have panicked the UK government, but its hasty plans for reform may be too late</p><p>The potential breakup of Britain has crept up on Boris Johnson in plain sight. Cavalier inattention in Downing Street to the souring political mood towards Whitehall in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as in parts of northern England, has been increasingly reckless. It may already be impossible for the Conservatives to retrieve the situation and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/24/scotland-independence-referendum-nicola-sturgeon-snp-wins-may-">keep the United Kingdom together</a> much longer.</p><p>Nevertheless, although it is late in the day, and in spite of the fact that ministers are arming themselves with policy responses that may prove ineffective, the Johnson government now claims to be on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jan/25/uk-covid-live-universal-credit-borders-schools-travel-boris-johnson-coronavirus-latest-updates?page=with:block-600ec1818f0858097c63dfc1#block-600ec1818f0858097c63dfc1">full alert</a> over the threat to the union.

## The Tory fixation on wokeness is all about division. Labour must build bridges instead | Zoe Williams

<p>The government’s version of identity politics has proved potent. The only response is to change the nature of the debate</p><p>I never thought I’d miss the 2010s, but I do have some nostalgia for them. At least last decade’s “opposite world” meant what it said: whatever the truth was, ministers would blame the opposite. In the creation of poverty, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/priti-patel-says-tory-government-not-to-blame-for-poverty-in-uk">the culprit</a> was the poor rather than the rich; in the nightmare of Brexit, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/07/architects-leave-act-self-destruction-brexit-remainers">problem was remainers</a> rather than leavers; in a runaway climate crisis, the root cause was Extinction Rebellion rather than fossil fuels and all those who’d hitched their finances to them.</p><p>It was pretty tedious, but it was preferable to today’s opposite world, in which, despite whatever is important – from Covid rates to customs turmoil – ministers will be trying their level best to talk about what is petty. (A piquant, if tangential, example: Monday’s Daily Telegraph, the little drummer boy of the endless culture war, reported approvingly the idea of an “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/01/25/citizens-advice-service-launches-help-employees-woke-workplaces/">anti-woke Citizens Advice</a> service”.) They create pantomimes, patriots battling straw men over trivia. This would make no sense if it came from a state in the grip of a crisis, but it makes every sense from a state with only one aim – the survival of its ruling party. To the modern conservative, all government business is party business.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/25/tories-wokeness-labour-identity-politics-government">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dom Bess and Jack Leach delivered under pressure to bowl out Sri Lanka, but will India’s batsmen be so accommodating?</p><p>The Test was in the balance early on the fourth morning. Sri Lanka’s openers had rattled off 15 quick runs from the opening overs of their second innings, and their team’s lead was just up above 50. And all the time, in the back of the mind, there was the nagging flashback to all the ham-fisted collapses England have endured over the years, and their early struggles having been set 74 to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jan/18/cricket-sri-lanka-england-first-test-day-five-report" title="">win the first Test</a> on this same ground in the fourth innings last week. The way Lasith Embuldeniya had been bowling so far this series, you wondered how many more runs he would need up his sleeve to run through them again in the fourth innings here. Would 100 be enough?

<p>Actor turned writer whose stylishly desolate plays and TV series were often suffused with dark-edged humour</p><p>Philip Martin, who has died aged 82, was a writer whose work for television synthesised gritty, often bleak and sometimes violent subjects with sly, offbeat humour and an innovative approach to the medium.</p><p>His groundbreaking series Gangsters (1976-78) began as a one-off Play for Today on BBC, shot on location in Birmingham, where Martin had embedded himself for weeks in order to authentically capture the city’s underbelly. A revenge story, it had a backdrop of seedy strip clubs and dodgy business deals as Maurice Colbourne, playing the anti-hero John Kline, uncovered a web of crime and illegal immigration. It was a raw, violent work with the odd surreal twist (including a pair of standup comedians acting as a chorus), deftly directed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/philip-saville-obituary">Philip Savile</a> with an unusually strong and well written array of leading parts for black and Asian actors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/25/philip-martin-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Slovenian orchestrated the 3-0 thrashing of Serie A leaders Milan and proved his side can compete without Papu Gómez</p><p>There are no medals for Serie A’s ‘Winter Champions’. Every year, that title is foisted on the team thattopsthe table at the season’s midway stage, and every year the players and manager point out that it does not mean a great deal.

<p>The pandemic has underlined how broken the UK’s model for urban development is. It’s time to build something new</p><p>Anyone in any large British city has only to look out of the window to see how their environment is being constantly reshaped in the interests of capital.

In Leeds, Birmingham, Cardiff or Manchester, you’d see luxury flats joined by high-rise student housing, with their rabbit-hutch flats. The tallest edifices in any city will tell you who and what actually rules. Here in Britain, it’s financial institutions and property speculation.</p><p>It is hard to see now amid the depression and anger, but the pandemic did briefly show cities acting on the basis of general human need: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/17/pandemic-housing-england-divide-owners-tenants">rough sleepers being housed, mutual aid groups being set up, evictions being suspended.</a> Yet the possibility of any long-term change is rapidly being lost.

<p>Frank Lampard's tenure as Chelsea manager is over, with Thomas Tuchel being lined up to replace him. The Englishman has had a successive run of poor games. The 42-year-old was brought back to the club that he served for well over a decade. During his first season in charge he did well; developing some of Chelsea's young players, reacting an FA Cup final and secured Champions League football. The former midfielder was also restricted due to the club's transfer ban. However, in season two the expectations changed.

## Aaron Rodgers' brilliance is clear but history may judge him unfairly

<p>The Green Bay Packers quarterback fell short in a championship game once again. There is a risk his extraordinary talent will be obscured</p><p>The ball was in Aaron Rodgers’s hands – until it wasn’t. It was fourth down, with a little over two minutes left in the NFC Championship game and the Green Bay Packers needed a touchdown and a successful two-point conversion to tie the game. Still, Rodgers will almost certainly be named the 2020 NFL MVP in the coming weeks. If anyone had earned this opportunity, it was Rodgers. Yet, Packers head coach Matt LaFleur decided instead to bring out Mason Crosby for a field goal that cut the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ lead from eight points to five. This gave the ball back to Tom Brady with two minutes left to go. To practically nobody’s surprise, Rodgers did not get the ball back. He instead was relegated to a mere spectator as he watched another Super Bowl dream die. The Buccaneers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jan/24/nfc-championship-game-tampa-bay-buccaneers-green-bay-packers-nfl-football">defeated the Packers 31-26</a>.</p><p>Rodgers is an all-time great quarterback. He’s a two-time league MVP – and almost certainly will be named MVP again this year – and has been elected to the Pro Bowl nine times. A list of his statistical accomplishments takes up two whole paragraphs of the three-paragraph introduction to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers">extremely long Wikipedia page</a>. There you can learn, among many other things, that Rodgers is the fastest player to get to 400 passing touchdowns and has the highest single-season passer rating (122.5 back in 2011). It’s ridiculous to think that his career could be considered a disappointment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jan/25/aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-quarterback-nfl-championship-game">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Luke Shaw is proving José Mourinho wrong, while West Ham could have European football on their minds next season</p><p>“He was in front of me and I was making every decision for him. He has to change his football brain,” José Mourinho said of Luke Shaw after a game in 2017. “We need his fantastic physical and technical qualities, but he cannot continue to play with my brain.” Few could have imagined four years later that the former Southampton defender could be first choice left-back at Old Trafford and eyeing up a return to the England squad. There is no arguing that Shaw looks far fitter now than four years ago but he has heeded Mourinho’s advice to “change his football brain”. Against Liverpool, Shaw was superb in defence and attack; going forward he made key overlapping runs, aiding Marcus Rashford to ensure United dominated that flank in a battle that was crucial to the victory. The arrival of Alex Telles seems to have spurred Shaw on to build on last season’s form. Gareth Southgate will have taken notice. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/25/fa-cup-fourth-round-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The year’s first grand slam will not produce a fair competition with many players forced to compete without a proper warmup</p><p>No tennis player across the world attracts drama like Yulia Putintseva. The story goes that at just 16, she lost in the finals of the US Open junior event, stormed off the court and when officials beckoned her to return she dramatically proclaimed: “It’s not safe to be around me.” She once flipped off an Australian Open crowd on her way out after a loss.

## In this seemingly endless lockdown, will we finally run out of TV? | Rebecca Nicholson

<p>We’ve watched the best shows, we’re bored of binge-watching and productions have been put on hold. But there is still hope</p><p>It is no great surprise that during the first lockdown people spent more time stuck to their screens. Last year, <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/lockdown-leads-to-surge-in-tv-screen-time-and-streaming#:~:text=A%20surge%20in%20screen%20time,of%20the%20nation%27s%20media%20habits">Ofcom reported</a> that in April we were watching around a third more television and online video than we had been a year before that, and that was when the weather was good. Netflix and Amazon Prime have both recently reported <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/27/netflix-amazon-and-disney-push-uk-to-more-than-32m-tv-streaming-customers">record numbers</a> of subscribers signing up over the past 12 months, with newcomers such as Disney+ attracting big audiences, too.</p><p>During that first lockdown, I was lucky enough to be able to work from home, and I set myself some TV goals. I would rewatch The Sopranos, because I had not seen it for at least 10 years, and I wanted to know if it still stood up as the best show in TV history. It does, and plenty of people had the same idea: it was one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/19/sopranos-hit-social-media-generation-mafia-series-emotional-struggles">breakout hits of 2020</a>. I would catch up with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/15/schitts-creek-netflix-pop-tv">Schitt’s Creek</a>. I would use documentaries to educate myself, probably starting with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/26/the-vietnam-war-review-a-complex-story-made-immediately-comprehensible">Ken Burns</a>, and I would make sure at least some of what I watched was not in English, because it’s easier not to be on your phone when you’re watching something Icelandic. (One Instagram scroll equals several crucial plot-points missed.) I thought there would be a new season of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/succession">Succession</a> soon enough.

<p>Conversations featuring the likes of Noam Chomsky, Brian Eno and Slavoj Žižek imagine a more communal world after Covid</p><p>In Giovanni Boccaccio’s <em>Decameron</em>, 10 friends escape from the city of Florence when it is shut down by the Black Death and hole up in a villa in the hills, where each night for a fortnight they tell one another stories of love and tragedy. Something of the same spirit animates this collection of conversations that occurred in the strangest of fortnights in our own times: the weeks at the end of March and the beginning of April last year when the whole world was first forced behind closed doors by Covid-19.</p><p>The conversations, conducted over Zoom, are mostly convened by the Croatian activist and writer Srećko Horvat who, along with Yanis Varoufakis, is the driving force behind <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/10/yanis-varoufakis-launches-pan-european-leftwing-movement-diem25">DiEM25</a>, a radical initiative that aims to more fully democratise the EU. The storytellers in this case, isolated in their studies and sitting rooms across the world, include leading figures of the intellectual left such as Noam Chomsky and Richard Sennett; critics of surveillance capitalism like Shoshana Zuboff and Evgeny Morozov; artists, musicians and actors including Brian Eno and Gael García Bernal; and, inevitably, contrarians like Tariq Ali and Slavoj Žižek. Their subject is the opportunity presented by the pandemic to reshape society, to “build back better” as the politicians’ phrase goes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/25/everything-must-change-review-avila-horvat-chomsky-zizek-covid-conversations-future">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A factory with more than 800 plants has been discovered in a building beside the Bank of England – and the news had an unexpected effect on me<br /></p><p>There’s always a detail in apocalypse fiction that looms horrifically in your subconscious from your first encounter with the genre, when you were a bit too young for it. Mine is plants bursting through concrete, that stark reminder that mankind is evanescent and nature is stronger. As a child, it was the most terrible thing I could imagine: grass growing through pavement, creepers tendrilling out of defunct offices. I think I got this phobia from The Day of the Triffids, possibly the only book in the British canon where the plants are the bad guy.</p><p>It’s easy to imagine it happening in the City of London, which is deader than every other dead place, eerie and full of foreboding. What happened instead was that someone <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/cannabis-factory-bank-of-england-city-of-london-b1790191.html">established a cannabis factory of “significant size”</a> (according to the police) right next to the Bank of England. It wasn’t the gigantic tent with the 826 plants that gave it away, but rather the strong smell commonly associated with the class B drug. Can you call a smell a smell when there’s nobody around to smell it? Philosophically, maybe not, but yes, in the eyes of the law.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/25/how-a-cannabis-farm-cured-my-fear-of-nature">Continue reading...</a>

The part-time author talks about the inspiration for her thriller about siblings who flee abusive parents and their ‘house of horror’</p><p>Abigail Dean was about to turn 30 when she suddenly realised that her job as a lawyer was using up all the oxygen in her life. “If I didn’t make a change,” she says, “I was going to still be there on my 40th birthday.” She took three months off, writing every day at Dulwich library in London, and ended up with the seeds of what would become her debut novel, Girl A.</p><p>“You don’t know me,” Lex, or Girl A, tells us as the novel opens, “but you’ll have seen my face.

But the story and its protectors grew weary, and in the danker corners of the internet we became easy to find.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/25/abigail-dean-girl-a-thriller-debut-google-lawyer">Continue reading...</a>

When she was able to finally access the treatment she needed, she began a slow recovery – which she is still coming to terms with </p><p>For as long as she can remember, the Guardian’s <strong>Jenny Stevens</strong> has had a difficult relationship with food and a feeling of being ill at ease with her body. As she moved through her teens into her 20s, these feelings intensified until she found herself skipping more and more meals while in the grip of anorexia. </p><p>She tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys </strong>that having recognised the problem herself, it was far from easy to get the treatment she needed. Faced with an obstructive GP, she was unable to get the referral she required for specialist care. Eventually she was referred to the eating disorder unit at the Maudsley hospital, south London, where she was able to begin the gradual road to recovery. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2021/jan/25/the-fight-for-recovery-from-a-lifelong-eating-disorder">Continue reading...</a>
