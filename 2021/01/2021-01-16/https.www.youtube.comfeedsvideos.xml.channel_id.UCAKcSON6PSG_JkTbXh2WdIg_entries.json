Lissie has certainly visited our studio and our booth at the Minnesota State Fair since this session, but here are two songs from that \"My Wild West\" session back in 2016.  \n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Don\u2019t You Give Up On Me\"\n4:01 \"Hero\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nLissie \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar\nStephen Howard \u2013 lead guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Anna Weggel; Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2009 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2009/11/13/lissie\n2011 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/01/20/lissie-live\n2012 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/07/10/lissie\n2013 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/05/23/lissie\n2018 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/01/26/hear-songs-from-lissie-s-new-album-castles\n2018 Minnesota State Fair session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/08/27/watch-lissie-perform-at-the-minnesota-state-fair\n2020 virtual session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/04/01/live-virtual-session-lissie\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#lissie #lissiemusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCjbQyKOiNw", "date_published": "2021-01-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
