treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 \n\n15 January 2021\n\nhttps://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-recovery-trial-chief-investigators-15-january-2021-recovery-trial-closes-recruitment-to-convalescent-plasma-treatment-for-patients-hospitalised-with-covid-19\n\nRECOVERY trial is being conducted by the registered clinical trials units with the Nuffield Department of Population Health in partnership with the Nuffield Department of Medicine\n\n176 hospitals across the whole of the UK\n\nSince May 2020, randomised comparison of convalescent plasma vs. usual care alone\n\nConvalescent plasma has been widely used as a treatment for COVID-19 but\n\nTo date there has been no convincing evidence of the effect of convalescent plasma on clinical outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19\n\nOn the advice of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), recruitment to the convalescent plasma arm of the RECOVERY trial has now closed\n\nNo convincing evidence that further recruitment would provide conclusive proof of worthwhile mortality benefit\n\nEither overall or in any pre-specified subgroup\n\nN = 10,406 randomised patients\n\nDeaths, 1,873 \n\nNo significant difference in the primary endpoint of 28-day mortality\n\nConvalescent plasma group (Experimental group)\n\n18%\n\nUsual care alone group (Control group)\n\n18%\n\nRisk ratio 1.04 (p = 0.34)\n\nFollow-up of patients is ongoing\n\nFinal results will be published ASAP\n\nRecruitment to all other treatment arms \u2013 tocilizumab, aspirin, colchicine, and Regeneron\u2019s antibody cocktail \u2013 continues as planned.\n\nProfessor Martin Landray, (Oxford)\n\nOnce again, the RECOVERY trial is demonstrating the value of large randomised trials to properly assess the role of potential treatments. \n\nProfessor Peter Horby\n\nThis is the largest ever trial of convalescent plasma and it was only possible thanks to the generous donation of plasma by recovered patients \n\nand the willingness of current patients to contribute to advancing medical care. \n\nWe owe them all a great debt of gratitude\n \nWhilst the overall result is negative, we need to await the full results before we can understand whether convalescent plasma has any role in particular patient subgroups\n\nDr Gail Miflin\n\nWe await the full results with interest, there is no doubt that this trial will provide a real answer to an important question\n\nNHSBT has helped deliver the largest ever randomised control trial of convalescent plasma\n\nThe story so far\n\nhttps://www.recoverytrial.net/news\n\nRECOVERY trial finds no benefit from azithromycin in
