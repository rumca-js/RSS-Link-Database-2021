Five years ago, singer-songwriter Lissie visited our studio to perform songs from her then-forthcoming album, "My Wild West." It was a pivotal time for Lissie; she had not long beforehand moved back to Iowa from California, and she had launched her own label, Lionboy. Lissie has certainly visited our studio and our booth at the Minnesota State Fair since this session, but here are two songs from that "My Wild West" session back in 2016.  

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Don’t You Give Up On Me"
4:01 "Hero"

PERSONNEL
Lissie – vocals, rhythm guitar
