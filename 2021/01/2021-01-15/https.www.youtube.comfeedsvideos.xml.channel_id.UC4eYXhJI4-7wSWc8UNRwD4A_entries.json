The Ukranian band's first globalFEST performance was in 2014, and their 2015 Tiny Desk concert remains a favorite. We've had them in our spaces, so it's a real treat to see them in theirs, the Dakh Theater in Kiev. Coming together, their performance maintains the energy and joy that define their music, bouncing off each other musically and emotionally. DakhaBrakha aims to keep Ukraine's musical and storytelling tradition alive by making it more accessible to a younger, international audience, a kind of self-proclaimed \"ethno-chaos.\" They craft stunning sonic worlds for traditional songs, reinventing their heritage with a keen ear for contemporary resonances.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Komora\"\n\"Vynnaya ya\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nIryna Kovalenko: vocals, keys, percussion\nMarko Halanevych: vocals, accordion\nNina Garenetska: vocals, cello\nOlena Tsybulska: vocals, drums\n\nCREDITS\n\nDirector: Vladyslav Troitskyi\nArt Manager: Iryna Gorba\nMixing Engineer: Maksym Taran\nAudio: Andrii Nidzelskyi\nPhotography: Stefanyak Juryj\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\nTINY DESK TEAM\n\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nGLOBALFEST TEAM\n\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, and Bill Bragin\n2021 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, and Viviana Benitez\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nHost: Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo\nSocial Media Manager: Valerie French\nPublicity: Brendan Gilmartin, Chart Room Media\nLegal Services: Tamizdat\nLegal Services: Duane Morris\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film\nVideo Production: MODEMA Studios", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX8dyBKGGD4", "date_published": "2021-01-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Dedicated Men Of Zion: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "Dedicated Men of Zion come to you from their backyard barbecue in North Carolina, bringing with them an electrified version of sacred Gospel soul music.

The online fest includes four nights of concerts featuring 16 bands from all over the world. From Monday, Jan. 11, through Thursday, Jan. 14, we'll be streaming new performances at 8 p.m. ET on NPR Music's YouTube channel and NPR.org.\n\nEvery January, I attend globalFEST at a New York City nightclub and see some of the most fantastic music I'll experience all year. Now, given the pandemic's challenges and the hardening of international borders, NPR Music and globalFEST is moving from the nightclub to your screen of choice and sharing this festival with the world. Each night, we'll present four artists in intimate settings (often behind desks donning globes), and it's all hosted by African superstar Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, who performed at the inaugural edition of globalFEST in 2004.\n\nFor the final night of Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST, we have Edwin Perez's presentation of salsa dura, First Nations advocate and singer-songwriter Elisapie performing in Montreal, 15-year-old Appalachian banjo player Nora Brown, and globalFEST alum Rokia Traor\u00e9 performing from Mali.\n\n0:00 INTRO\n2:26 EDWIN PEREZ\n21:43 ELISAPIE\n38:23 NORA BROWN\n53:08 ROKIA TRAOR\u00c9\n\nBelow you'll find short descriptions about each act, written by the globalFEST team.\n\nEDWIN PEREZ\nFrom the basement of the Bowery Electric in downtown Manhattan, composer and vocalist Edwin Perez and his 10-piece band come together to put on a show. With a strong backbeat and enough room to move around, Perez's up-tempo energy brings the party and keeps it going. The theme of the night is salsa dura music, which originated in New York in the 1970s and gained acclaim thanks to acts like the Fania All-Stars and Spanish Harlem Orchestra.\n\nSET LIST\n\"La Salsa Que Me Cri\u00f3\"\n\"No Puedo Respirar\" (I Can't Breathe)\n\"Mi Tierra\"\n\nELISAPIE\nElisapie returns to Tiny Desk for a show-stopping performance from Montreal, with the disco globe of our dreams helping to light her set. Elisapie, in both her songs and work, is a resounding advocate of First Nations culture in Canada. In her set, she harnesses an incredible energy with electrifying, emotive vocals.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Qanniuguma\"\n\"Wolves Don't Live by the Rules\"\n\"Arnaq\"\n\nNORA BROWN\n30 feet below the surface in Brooklyn, 10th grader Nora Brown brings incredible, surprising depth to the Appalachian music she plays. Over the course of her Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST concert, surrounded by innumerable globes and instruments, she infuses new life and energy into the traditional songs of Addie Graham, Virgil Anderson and Fred Cockerham. Nora weaves together songs and storytelling, speaking of the great history of the music that came before her and at which she excels.\n\nSET LIST\n\"The Very Day I'm Gone\"\n\"Miner's Dream\"\n\"Little Satchel\"\n\nROKIA TRAOR\u00c9\nRokia Traor\u00e9 performed at globalFEST in 2005, the music festival's second year, and it's a thrill to present her meditative performance as part of Tiny Desk meets globalFEST. Her work is rooted in the Malian musical tradition, but defies the confines of a single culture. Born in Mali to a diplomat father, Traor\u00e9 had a nomadic upbringing that exposed her to a wide variety of international musical influences. She joins us from Blues Faso, a theater inside her Foundation Passerelle in Mali, which she created to support emerging, interdisciplinary artists, from music and the performing arts to visual arts and photography.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Souba L\u00e9\"\n\"Tiramakan\"\n\"Fakoly\"\n\n---\n\nTINY DESK TEAM \nProducer: Bob Boilen \nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey \nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann \n\nGLOBALFEST TEAM \nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, and Bill Bragin\n2021 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, and Viviana Benitez\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake \nHost: Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo\nSocial Media Manager: Valerie French\nPublicity: Brendan Gilmartin, Chart Room Media \nLegal Services: Tamizdat\nLegal Services: Duane Morris\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film \nVideo Production: MODEMA Studios \n\nTHE OFFICE performing arts + film consists of Diane Eber, Rachel Chanoff, Laurie Cearley, Olli Chanoff, Erica Zielinski, Gabrielle Davenport, Catherine DeGennaro, Noah Bashevkin, Lynn Koek, Bruna D'Avila, Chloe Golding, Kyla Gardner, Zion Jackson, Tess Peppis, Scout Eisenberg \n\nMODEMA Studios consists of Jammal Lemy (director and editor), Matt Deitsch (producer), Theo Braun (audio), and Gary Blake (editor) \n\nSpecial Thanks: Joshua Feigenbaum, Mona Golub, Steven Kirkpatrick, Daniel C.

Much of the music comes from her recent 2020 EPs, Dawn and Dusk. Those EPs included collaborations with Carly Rae Jepsen and Tune-Yards' Merrill Garbus. For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, her sweet voice and ukulele are accompanied by Nicole Wakabayashi on piano and Cale Hawkins on guitar.\n\nIt's been almost two years now since we first played the Oakland-based mxmtoon on All Songs Considered. She was just 18 then, singing about crying in her \"prom dress\" (which I'm thrilled she is performing here). Her melodies are simple, with the words up front mighty and personal. One of the first songs she released is called \"Feelings Are Fatal,\" which she also performs. It's a candid song about emotions and why we're often afraid to share them. It's a model for what mxmtoon does so well: humble, honest songs, sung here behind a massive desk.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Fever Dream\"\n\"Prom Dress\"\n\"Feelings Are Fatal\"\n\"Wallflower\"\n\"Bon Iver\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nmxmtoon: vocals, ukulele\nNicole Wakabayashi: piano\nCale Hawkins: guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Derrick Belcham\nAudio: K.
