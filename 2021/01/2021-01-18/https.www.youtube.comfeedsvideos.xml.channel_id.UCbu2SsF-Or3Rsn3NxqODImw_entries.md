IO Interactive's stealth game Hitman 3 is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Stadia.

How would you describe the dialogue in Cyberpunk 2077? You might say that it sounds mostly natural... unless you noticed a particular quirk with the way nearly every character speaks. As it turns out, most characters in Cyberpunk 2077 chop off the subject at the beginning of their sentences, something they have in common with CD Projekt Red's own Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher 3. 

In this video, Jake Dekker breaks down the possible reason why CDPR's characters talk this way. Both Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3 were written in Polish and translated into English, and in Polish, it's actually very common to drop the subject of a sentence because they're often unnecessary. There's a brief but (hopefully) simple explanation of how this works if you don't speak any languages that do this, so buckle up and be ready to learn. 

If you didn't notice this before, you probably won't be able to un-hear it after this video. Let us know in the comments if you noticed this about Cyberpunk 2077 and what you think of this dialogue style.
