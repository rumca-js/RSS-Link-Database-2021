Edith - a Holocaust survivor and a specialist in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Her latest book The Gift - 12 Lessons To Save Your Life, shows us how to stop destructive patterns and imprisoning thoughts in order to find freedom and enjoy life. It is available now.\n\nI think it is important at this time of crisis, chaos and conflict to hear a voice from someone who survived the most extreme situation in recent history, The Holocaust. At a time of much division and hateful rhetoric, confusion from all sides, here is a voice that can be truly unifying.\n\nYou can listen to all my Under The Skin podcasts on Luminary - there is a new podcast out every Saturday:\nhttp://luminary.link/russell\n\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/russellbrand/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/rustyrockets\n\nProduced by Jenny May Finn (Instagram: @jennymayfinn)", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRa6niMqZCY", "date_published": "2021-01-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
