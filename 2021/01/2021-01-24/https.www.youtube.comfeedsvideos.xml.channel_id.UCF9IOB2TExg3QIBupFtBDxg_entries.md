CDC

The CDC has reached out to UK officials and is reviewing their new mortality data associated with variant B.1.1.7

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/23/health/uk-variant-cdc-review/index.html

Only 195 cases so far, but in 22 states
 
Many more cases are going undetected

California and Florida

Michael Osterholm, Epidemiologist, Coronavirus transition team

Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, University of Minnesota

From public and non-public data, convinced that the new variant is deadlier

The data is mounting -- and some of it I can't share -- that clearly supports that B.1.1.7 is causing more severe illness and increased death

Already we know this variant has increased transmission, and so this is more very bad news

South Africa travel ban

South African variant, 501Y.V2 

50% more infectious

In at least 20 countries

Not yet found in US

President Biden, impose a ban on most non-U.S. citizens entering the country who have recently been in South Africa

Last week, entry ban, Brazil, United Kingdom, Ireland, 26 countries in Europe that allow travel across open borders


High-transmission variants in Canada

January 25, 2021 

What happens if a high-transmission variant becomes established, and is transmitted in the general community in Canada? 

http://www.sfu.ca/magpie/blog/high-transmission-variant-modelling.html

Trajectory we may see, higher-transmission variant

B.1.1.7, 40-80% increase in the reproduction number

Variant with a 40+% increase in transmission rate, likely would not be contained with current measures

What does it mean?

Failure to prevent or contain this now spells disaster in March. 

While we don't see much impact for ~6 weeks

when it comes it comes steeply,

doubling time of 1-2 weeks

(Current about 30-40 days recently in provinces like Ontario)

Exponential growth

When you're halfway to the maximum capacity you can tolerate, you only have one doubling time left.
But it might have taken 8 doubling times to get to halfway

So what can we do? 

Few detected B.1.1.7 cases already in Canada, (hope that community spread has not yet been established)

Prevent introductions of new variants into Canada

Step up quarantine and isolation of travellers

Improve detection

Be willing to act to curtail the spread of high-transmission variants already in Canada

If and when we find out that COVID-19 vaccines can impact transmission -- and we think it is likely that they will -- we could 

Use vaccination as one of the tools in the transmission toolkit, e.g. truckers, Canada/US border

Reduce travel within Canada

Consider screening domestic travellers

Vaccination is not going to impact transmission in the 6-8 week time frame 

Does homeopathy have a role in preventing and treating CoViD?

viable modality in the treatment of Covid-19

coronavirus as a unique opportunity to use the current crisis for strengthening the foundations of 
homeopathy

Professor Stephen Powis, NHS medical director

It's one thing for homeopaths to peddle useless but harmless potions, 
but they cross a dangerous line when making ridiculous assertions about protecting people from Covid infection.

We urge everyone to ignore misleading claims and get vital protection against Covid when they are invited for their vaccine

Post vaccine contagion

Prof Jonathan Van-Tam

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55784199

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/23/exclusive-five-million-vaccinated-britons-told-carry-have-virus/

Could still pass the virus on to others

Should continue following all rules, zero behavioural change

Carry on as if you have the virus

You could still be spreading the virus

Do not yet know the impact of the vaccine on transmission

No vaccine has ever been 100% effective

Possible to contract the virus, 2 to 3 weeks after vaccination

Better to allow at least three weeks in older people

Transmission possible after 2 doses

British Medical Association

Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine

Twelve weeks policy, difficult to justify

Reduced gap to six weeks

Prof Van-Tam

What none of these will tell me is: 

who on the at-risk list should suffer slower access to their first dose so that someone else who's already had one dose can get a second?
