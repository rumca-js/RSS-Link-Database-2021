She was best known for playing Lilo Lil in the BBC sitcom Bread (1986-91), about the Liverpudlian Boswell family. The role was originally written as native Liverpool, so Polly tried out her Scouse on her taxi driver. When he asked what part of Australia she came from, she decided to stick to Irish. She loved playing the character, but other work meant more to her.</p><p>I first met Polly in the heady days of late-1970s feminism and ructions between the right and left in our union, Equity. Alternative theatre was booming. Polly worked with the political group Belt &amp; Braces, but the lack of women\u2019s roles led her to co-found the feminist companies <a href=\"http://www.unfinishedhistories.com/history/companies/bloomers/\">Bloomers</a> and Camouflage, and write much of their material. In 1989, she was a fiery Mother Jones in Fight Like Tigers, about the Irish-American union activist. Polly was an articulate, passionate campaigner and outspoken socialist-feminist. As a friend said, she \u201ccould make the toughest of activists cower for an unguarded remark\u201d.
