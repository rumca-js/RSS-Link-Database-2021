More than just a tide-pod. I had this idea when watching through some old coffee break advertising videos combined with perhaps the most memorable superbowl ad of the last decade. The TIDE Superbowl LII ad by satchi and satchi. 

Mark Ritson's Analysis of Tide is amazing as well, I reference him here: https://www.marketingweek.com/mark-ritson-tide-super-bowl-ad-effectiveness/

this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.
