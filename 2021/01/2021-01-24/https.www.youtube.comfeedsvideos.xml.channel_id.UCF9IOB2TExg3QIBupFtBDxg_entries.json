is reviewing their new mortality data associated with variant B.1.1.7\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/23/health/uk-variant-cdc-review/index.html\n\nOnly 195 cases so far, but in 22 states\n \nMany more cases are going undetected\n\nCalifornia and Florida\n\nMichael Osterholm, Epidemiologist, Coronavirus transition team\n\nDirector of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, University of Minnesota\n\nFrom public and non-public data, convinced that the new variant is deadlier\n\nThe data is mounting -- and some of it I can't share -- that clearly supports that B.1.1.7 is causing more severe illness and increased death\n\nAlready we know this variant has increased transmission, and so this is more very bad news\n\nSouth Africa travel ban\n\nSouth African variant, 501Y.V2 \n\n50% more infectious\n\nIn at least 20 countries\n\nNot yet found in US\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-travel-exclusi-idUSKBN29T0P6\n\nPresident Biden, impose a ban on most non-U.S. citizens entering the country who have recently been in South Africa\n\nLast week, entry ban, Brazil, United Kingdom, Ireland, 26 countries in Europe that allow travel across open borders\n\n\nHigh-transmission variants in Canada\n\nJanuary 25, 2021 \n\nWhat happens if a high-transmission variant becomes established, and is transmitted in the general community in Canada? \n\nhttp://www.sfu.ca/magpie/blog/high-transmission-variant-modelling.html\n\nTrajectory we may see, higher-transmission variant\n\nB.1.1.7, 40-80% increase in the reproduction number\n\nVariant with a 40+% increase in transmission rate, likely would not be contained with current measures\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nFailure to prevent or contain this now spells disaster in March. \n\nWhile we don't see much impact for ~6 weeks\n\nwhen it comes it comes steeply,\n\ndoubling time of 1-2 weeks\n\n(Current about 30-40 days recently in provinces like Ontario)\n\nExponential growth\n\nWhen you're halfway to the maximum capacity you can tolerate, you only have one doubling time left.\nBut it might have taken 8 doubling times to get to halfway\n\nSo what can we do? \n\nFew detected B.1.1.7 cases already in Canada, (hope that community spread has not yet been established)\n\nPrevent introductions of new variants into Canada\n\nStep up quarantine and isolation of travellers\n\nImprove detection\n\nBe willing to act to curtail the spread of high-transmission variants already in Canada\n\nIf and when we find out that COVID-19 vaccines can impact transmission -- and we think it is likely that they will -- we could \n\nUse vaccination as one of the tools in the transmission toolkit, e.g. truckers, Canada/US border\n\nReduce travel within Canada\n\nConsider screening domestic travellers\n\nVaccination is not going to impact transmission in the 6-8 week time frame \n\nDoes homeopathy have a role in preventing and treating CoViD?\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/24/homeopaths-have-crossed-line-peddling-dangerous-vaccine-myths/\n\n4Homeopathy\n\nRepresenting 11 leading homeopathic organisations and

people\n\nviable modality in the treatment of Covid-19\n\ncoronavirus as a unique opportunity to use the current crisis for strengthening the foundations of \nhomeopathy\n\nProfessor Stephen Powis, NHS medical director\n\nIt's one thing for homeopaths to peddle useless but harmless potions, \nbut they cross a dangerous line when making ridiculous assertions about protecting people from Covid infection.\n\nWe urge everyone to ignore misleading claims and get vital protection against Covid when they are invited for their vaccine\n\nDuck extract product selling on eBay\n\nMHRA, \n\ncannot be
