Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | January 25, 2021\nIt's been 10 years since the band Future Islands performed its first Tiny Desk concert. Now its four members are gathered not too far from their Baltimore base in Carroll Baldwin Memorial Hall, sans desk. \"We lost the desk,\" singer Sam Herring tells us with a smile. With drummer Michael Lowry on the tiny stage, the rest of the band \u2014 including bassist William Cashion and Gerrit Welmers on electronics \u2014 took to the floor, allowing Sam Herring to make his moves and sing his heart out. This music is clearly for the head and the feet.\n\nThe songs are from their sixth and very recent album, As Long As You Are. Along with themes of loneliness and love, we also hear songs about race, which is most evident in \"The Painter,\" a song about how we can all look at the same thing and see it so differently. We end with a song that came out shortly after visiting NPR in 2011 called \"Balance.\" It's one of those tunes that feels repurposed for the 2020s: \"This is a song for anybody who's struggling through their lives,\" Sam Herring says, \"and I know there are a lot of you all out there, just trying to get by, but it's going to take a little bit more time.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Hit the Coast\"\n\"The Painter\"\n\"Thrill\"\n\"Balance\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nSam Herring: vocals\nWilliam Cashion: bass\nGerrit Welmers: keyboards\nMichael Lowry: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Marisa Gesualdi\nAudio: Steve Wright of Wright Way Studios\nDirector: Marisa Gesualdi\nDirector of Photography: Jake DeNicola\nCameras: Jake DeNicola, Hil Steadman, Marisa Gesualdi\nEngineer: Paul Mercer\nMonitors Engineer: Matthew Ricchini\nCovid-19 Compliance Officer: Tosha Potter\nCovid-19 Compliance Assistant: Jerry Potter\nProduction Assistant: Melany Rochester\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle Smith\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8fbjYgGouM", "date_published": "2021-01-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Edwin Perez: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "Every January, I attend globalFEST at a New York City nightclub and see some of the most fantastic music I'll experience all year.

With a strong backbeat and enough room to move around, Perez's up-tempo energy brings the party and keeps it going. The theme of the night is salsa dura music, which originated in New York in the 1970s and gained acclaim thanks to acts like the Fania All-Stars and Spanish Harlem Orchestra.\n\nSET LIST\n\"The Garden of Love\"\n\"Talk About It\"\n\"The Underdog\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMartha Redbone: vocals, percussion\nAaron Whitby: keys\nMarvin Sewell: guitars\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Martha Redbone\nVideo and Audio: Martha Redbone and Aaron Whitby\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nGLOBALFEST TEAM\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, and Bill Bragin\n2021 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, and Viviana Benitez\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nHost: Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo\nSocial Media Manager: Valerie French\nPublicity: Brendan Gilmartin, Chart Room Media\nLegal Services: Tamizdat\nLegal Services: Duane Morris\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film\nVideo Production: MODEMA Studios", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S77KlsGlbCI", "date_published": "2021-01-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Elisapie: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "Every January, I attend globalFEST at a New York City nightclub and see some of the most fantastic music I'll experience all year.

Her work is rooted in the Malian musical tradition, but defies the confines of a single culture. Born in Mali to a diplomat father, Traor\u00e9 had a nomadic upbringing that exposed her to a wide variety of international musical influences. She joins us from Blues Faso, a theater inside her Foundation Passerelle in Mali, which she created to support emerging, interdisciplinary artists, from music and the performing arts to visual arts and photography.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Qanniuguma\"\n\"Wolves Don't Live by the Rules\"\n\"Arnaq\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nElisapie: vocals\nJean-S\u00e9bastien Williams: guitar\nJoshua Toal: bass\nJason Sharp: saxophone\nRobbie Kuster: drums\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Edwin Perez\nVideo: Francis Maheu, Dominic Boudreau\nAudio: Alexandre Fallu, Pierre Girard\nProduction Coordinator: Sophie Bernier-Blanchette\nArtistic Director, Lights: Julie Basse\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nGLOBALFEST TEAM\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, and Bill Bragin\n2021 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, and Viviana Benitez\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nHost: Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo\nSocial Media Manager: Valerie French\nPublicity: Brendan Gilmartin, Chart Room Media\nLegal Services: Tamizdat\nLegal Services: Duane Morris\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film\nVideo Production: MODEMA Studios", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpY060dYQgM", "date_published": "2021-01-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
