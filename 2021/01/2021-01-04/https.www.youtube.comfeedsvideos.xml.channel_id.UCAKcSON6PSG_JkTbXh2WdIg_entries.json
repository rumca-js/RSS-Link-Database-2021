During that show, Pres Hall creative director and bassist Ben Jaffe shared a cool bit of information with the audience. \"We were just reminded a few moments ago that the first time that the Preservation Hall Jazz Band ever played a show outside of New Orleans was here in Minneapolis in 1963,\" Jaffe said. \"And the second show that the band ever played outside of New Orleans was in Minneapolis in 1964.\"\n\nWatch three selections from the 2018 show by the legendary Preservation Hall Jazz Band.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n00:00 \"Santiago\"\n06:23 \"La Malanga\"\n13:12 \"Convergence\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nCharlie Gabriel \u2013 saxophone\nWalter Harris \u2013 drums\nBen Jaffe \u2013 bass\nRonnell Johnson \u2013 trombone\nBranden Lewis \u2013 trumpet\nClint Maedgen \u2013 sax\nKyle Roussel \u2013 piano\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Jim McGuinn\n\nFIND MORE:\n2013 interview and session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/07/21/preservation-hall-jazz-band-live\n2015 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/03/27/preservation-hall-jazz-band-perform-live-in-the-current-studio\n2018 MicroShow at the Dakota:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/01/02/preservation-hall-jazz-band-perform-a-spirited-microshow-at-the-dakota-jazz-club\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#preservationhalljazzband #preshallband #preshalljazz", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB88X_JCTAI", "date_published": "2021-01-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
