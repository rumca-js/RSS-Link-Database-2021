"description": "<p>As in March, the prime minister has been culpably slow to respond to a new phase of the crisis </p><p>Last March, as the public clamour for stricter measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 became impossible to ignore, the government fretted over the country\u2019s willingness to sign up to a national lockdown. As it turned out, most people were far more hawkish than the government in supporting draconian restrictions on everyday life. By waiting until late in the month, crucial ground was lost and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52955034\" title=\"\">so</a>, unnecessarily, were thousands of lives.</p><p>As the new Covid variant strengthens its grip across the country, it has become clear that the lessons of March were not learned. In Scotland, where rates of infection are lower than in England, Nicola Sturgeon has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/04/scotland-to-go-into-full-lockdown-at-midnight-sturgeon-announces\" title=\"\">announced</a> a national lockdown, beginning at midnight. By contrast, amid total confusion over the reopening of schools, Boris Johnson has prevaricated and procrastinated. The tougher restrictions for England are finally being introduced almost a week after this newspaper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/30/the-guardian-view-on-responding-to-the-covid-19-surge-not-enough\" title=\"\">called for</a> a lockdown.

Long-suffering, virtuous Kirsty Miller was arrested for modern slavery crimes committed not by her, but by her new husband, the unscrupulous, controlling builder Philip Moss. The storyline is an example of what the soap opera, the longest-running in the world, is particularly adept at achieving: throwing light on a pressing social issue of the day by playing out its consequences in real time. Indeed, time itself is perhaps the most crucial ingredient of The Archers, as its listeners eavesdrop, for 12 minutes a day, on the comings and goings, the heartbreaks and scandals, the tragedies and comedies, of a fictional village called Ambridge.</p><p>The writer on social history David Kynaston, in a Radio 4 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000qxd4\" title=\"\">documentary</a> marking the drama\u2019s milestone, elegantly charted how the programme has tracked social change in rural England. Even the 1960s happened, up to a point, in Ambridge, courtesy of the scandal of Jennifer Archer\u2019s illegitimate baby in 1967. That illegitimate baby is Adam, now a married, gay farmer and the father, via a surrogate, of a toddler \u2013 a family arrangement unthinkable when he was born. Kynaston also noted that The Archers has a history of strong, competent women: Peggy Archer, played since 1951 by 101-year-old June Spencer, defied convention and took control of the village pub in the 1950s when her husband was too drunk and incompetent to do it himself. Even Jennifer, who eventually married new money, and who is not exactly a career woman, is portrayed with surprising depth and sensitivity by the writers: she has flaws and layers and a great deal of inner grit. In the early 1980s, Pat Archer, champion of organic farming, enrolled on a women\u2019s studies course, becoming the show\u2019s first feminist. She also changed the family newspaper from the Express to the Guardian, which, undoubtedly, she still takes.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-archers-happy-birthday-to-the-worlds-oldest-soap\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-archers-happy-birthday-to-the-worlds-oldest-soap", "date_published": "2021-01-04 19:27:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Democrats ask FBI to investigate Trump's Georgia phone call", "description": "<p>Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice say: \u2018We believe Donald Trump engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes\u2019</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jan/04/donald-trump-georgia-votes-joe-biden-brad-raffensperger-senate-covid-coronavirus-us-politics-live\">US politics \u2013 live coverage</a></li></ul><p>Two Democrats have asked the FBI to open a criminal investigation into Donald Trump over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/03/trump-georgia-raffensperger-call-biden-washington-post\">a phone call</a> in which he pressured Georgia state officials to overturn the presidential election in his favour.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/03/trump-georgia-raffensperger-call-biden-washington-post\">'I just want 11,780 votes': Trump pressed Georgia to overturn Biden victory</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/04/trump-georgia-phone-call-democrats-ask-fbi-investigate\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/04/trump-georgia-phone-call-democrats-ask-fbi-investigate", "date_published": "2021-01-04 19:26:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Scottish MP Margaret Ferrier arrested over alleged Covid rule breach", "description": "<p>Alleged incident relates to breaking of regulations between 26 September and 29 September<br /></p><p>The suspended Scottish National party MP Margaret Ferrier has been arrested by police and charged with breaching coronavirus restrictions.</p><p>Police Scotland said Ferrier, 60, had been charged \u201cin connection with alleged culpable and reckless conduct\u201d for allegedly failing to observe the regulations limiting travel and social contact.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/04/scottish-mp-margaret-ferrier-arrested-over-alleged-covid-rule-breach\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/04/scottish-mp-margaret-ferrier-arrested-over-alleged-covid-rule-breach", "date_published": "2021-01-04 19:25:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus live news: Brazil detects new UK variant;

Not the most charismatic way to start a column, I know, especially the first of the year \u2013 happy new year! \u2013 but it is the truth, and a significant part of my eating life. As a child, I discovered that liking cabbage carried a risk: that of being called smelly, although this didn\u2019t stop me eating all my school lunch, then offering to finish my friend\u2019s. Young trauma faded into twentysomething worries about my sulphurous hair, although this didn\u2019t stop me eating the cabbage soup I prescribed myself. But then, in my early 30s, I found myself living in a building that, thanks to a trattoria serving a typically Roman and therefore cruciferous menu, smelled more strongly of cabbage (also of broccoli, chicory and spinach) than I did. It was like meeting a kindred spirit, only made of bricks and cement; I fitted right in.</p><p>I am exaggerating, of course \u2013 but only slightly. Our building is a cabbage and broccoli bong much of the time; the sulphurous scent hanging around the courtyard and communal stairwells like fruit flies around half a melon in high summer. The smell is not alone: the bread shop, the bar dispatching espressos, bins and various degrees of home cooking all compete for airspace. But the scent of cabbage prevails. And I like the pong as much as the flavour of this great, green vegetable named after a head, especially deep-green savoy, with its blasted leaves and tree-like rib that taste like chlorophyll, iron, mustard and nutty butter.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/04/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-rice-and-cabbage-soup\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/04/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-rice-and-cabbage-soup", "date_published": "2021-01-04 11:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'We tortured families': The lingering damage of Trump's separation policy", "description": "<p>Civil rights groups want to see the Biden administration reunify victims, grant protection in the US and provide restitution</p><p>The US government\u2019s policy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/21/trump-separation-policy-545-children-parents-still-not-found\">separating migrant families at the border</a> has continued to wreak havoc and inflict suffering<strong> </strong>in the final months of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, with parents still missing, reunifications blocked and reunited families struggling to pick up the pieces of their lives.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/04/trump-administration-family-separation-immigrants-joe-biden\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/04/trump-administration-family-separation-immigrants-joe-biden", "date_published": "2021-01-04 11:00:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How the 'shecession' will cause long-term harm for women in the US", "description": "<p>C Nicole Mason, who coined the term to describe a recession that affects women disproportionately, sets out what is needed for an equitable recovery</p><p>For the first time in history, the US is in a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/04/shecession-coronavirus-pandemic-economic-fallout-women\">shecession</a>\u201d \u2013 an economic downturn where job and income losses are affecting women more than men.
