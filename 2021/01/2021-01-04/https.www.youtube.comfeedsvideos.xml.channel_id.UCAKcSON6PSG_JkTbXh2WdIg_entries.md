This week in 2018, we aired a MicroShow performance recorded by the Preservation Hall Jazz Band at the Dakota Jazz Club in Minneapolis. During that show, Pres Hall creative director and bassist Ben Jaffe shared a cool bit of information with the audience. "We were just reminded a few moments ago that the first time that the Preservation Hall Jazz Band ever played a show outside of New Orleans was here in Minneapolis in 1963," Jaffe said. "And the second show that the band ever played outside of New Orleans was in Minneapolis in 1964."

Watch three selections from the 2018 show by the legendary Preservation Hall Jazz Band.
