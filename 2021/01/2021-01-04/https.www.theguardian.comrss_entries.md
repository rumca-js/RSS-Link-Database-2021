## The Guardian view on Boris Johnson: forever behind the Covid curve | Editorial

<p>As in March, the prime minister has been culpably slow to respond to a new phase of the crisis </p><p>Last March, as the public clamour for stricter measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 became impossible to ignore, the government fretted over the country’s willingness to sign up to a national lockdown. As it turned out, most people were far more hawkish than the government in supporting draconian restrictions on everyday life. By waiting until late in the month, crucial ground was lost and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52955034" title="">so</a>, unnecessarily, were thousands of lives.</p><p>As the new Covid variant strengthens its grip across the country, it has become clear that the lessons of March were not learned. In Scotland, where rates of infection are lower than in England, Nicola Sturgeon has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/04/scotland-to-go-into-full-lockdown-at-midnight-sturgeon-announces" title="">announced</a> a national lockdown, beginning at midnight. By contrast, amid total confusion over the reopening of schools, Boris Johnson has prevaricated and procrastinated. The tougher restrictions for England are finally being introduced almost a week after this newspaper <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/30/the-guardian-view-on-responding-to-the-covid-19-surge-not-enough" title="">called for</a> a lockdown.

## The Guardian view on The Archers: happy birthday to the world’s oldest soap | Editorial

<p>Loved and hated in equal measure, its very presence is reassuring and comforting in difficult times</p><p>On New Year’s Day, BBC Radio 4’s serial drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/15/the-archers-weird-genius-peculiarly-english-epic" title="">The Archers turned 70</a> with a satisfying plot twist. Long-suffering, virtuous Kirsty Miller was arrested for modern slavery crimes committed not by her, but by her new husband, the unscrupulous, controlling builder Philip Moss. The storyline is an example of what the soap opera, the longest-running in the world, is particularly adept at achieving: throwing light on a pressing social issue of the day by playing out its consequences in real time. Indeed, time itself is perhaps the most crucial ingredient of The Archers, as its listeners eavesdrop, for 12 minutes a day, on the comings and goings, the heartbreaks and scandals, the tragedies and comedies, of a fictional village called Ambridge.</p><p>The writer on social history David Kynaston, in a Radio 4 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000qxd4" title="">documentary</a> marking the drama’s milestone, elegantly charted how the programme has tracked social change in rural England. Even the 1960s happened, up to a point, in Ambridge, courtesy of the scandal of Jennifer Archer’s illegitimate baby in 1967. That illegitimate baby is Adam, now a married, gay farmer and the father, via a surrogate, of a toddler – a family arrangement unthinkable when he was born. Kynaston also noted that The Archers has a history of strong, competent women: Peggy Archer, played since 1951 by 101-year-old June Spencer, defied convention and took control of the village pub in the 1950s when her husband was too drunk and incompetent to do it himself. Even Jennifer, who eventually married new money, and who is not exactly a career woman, is portrayed with surprising depth and sensitivity by the writers: she has flaws and layers and a great deal of inner grit. In the early 1980s, Pat Archer, champion of organic farming, enrolled on a women’s studies course, becoming the show’s first feminist. She also changed the family newspaper from the Express to the Guardian, which, undoubtedly, she still takes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-archers-happy-birthday-to-the-worlds-oldest-soap">Continue reading...</a>

Film and TV star who found fame as one of Charlie’s Angels and was a Bond girl opposite Roger Moore in A View to a Kill<p>Tanya Roberts, who has died aged 65, was already a film and television star when she was cast as a “Bond girl”, Stacy Sutton, opposite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/23/sir-roger-moore-obituary-james-bond" title="">Roger Moore</a> in A View to a Kill (1985). Moore was 58 at the time, and looking somewhat creaky as he scaled the Golden Gate Bridge during his final outing in the role of James Bond, while Roberts was 30 and having the time of her life commandeering a fire engine during a chase through San Francisco, albeit with a little help from bluescreen technology.</p><p>She was second choice for the part after the film’s producers were unable to secure Priscilla Presley. This hardly fazed Roberts, who had already made her name stepping into another actor’s shoes when she was cast in 1981 as Shelley Hack’s replacement on the fifth season of Charlie’s Angels, the hit television series about a trio of glamorous female crime-fighters. “That’s the way every job is,” she told the talk-show host <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jan/24/usnews.guardianobituaries" title="">Johnny Carson</a> when he queried the show’s personnel changes. “There was someone before, there’ll be someone after you.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/04/tanya-roberts-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

On Radio 4, Emma Barnett took over Woman’s Hour, with Naga Munchetty moving into the slot on Radio 5 live that Barnett occupied until December, bringing two of the finest broadcasters of the younger generation into scheduling competition.</p><p>Barnett started by reading out a letter the show had solicited from the Queen, congratulating Woman’s Hour on its 75th anniversary this year: a counterintuitive traditionalism from a 35-year-old presenter, although segueing to a specially recorded song by the former Spice Girl Mel C suggested a desire to cover the generational bases. Munchetty also started with music, reading her menu of the items coming up over a thumping drum’n’bass track, which seemed mainly designed to make the show sound different from Barnett’s reign, and from Munchetty’s other gig on BBC One Breakfast News.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/04/emma-barnett-and-naga-munchetty-how-did-they-fare-on-their-first-day">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Rodgers and Hammerstein number became a football anthem via the late Gerry Marsden, bringing euphoric determination to every era of Liverpool FC from Shankly to Klopp</p><p>“It never stops creating goosebumps,” is how Liverpool manager <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2017/04/28/59036942268e3e46608b459e.html">Jürgen Klopp describes it</a>. “It never stops feeling really special.”</p><p>Our team’s anthem – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV5_LQArLa0">Gerry and the Pacemakers’ You’ll Never Walk Alone</a> – was not the reason Klopp came to Liverpool, but he’s talked about the moment he first heard it ringing out around the ground, and how that reassured him that he’d made the right choice to move to Merseyside. Indeed, if you could condense Klopp’s entire philosophy into one song – sticking together when times get tough, trust in the abilities of others, a conviction that better days are ahead – it would be You’ll Never Walk Alone. It’s been the club’s anthem since it topped the UK charts in 1963, providing joy and comfort during the triumphs and tragedies of the decades that have followed. Fans are now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/03/gerry-marsden-frontman-of-gerry-and-the-pacemakers-dies-aged-78">mourning the death, at 78, of the man who sang it – Gerry Marsden</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/04/how-youll-never-walk-alone-came-to-define-liverpool-fc-spirit-gerry-marsden">Continue reading...</a>

## 'I did hate TV': Selina Scott on Trump, Prince Andrew, Frank Bough and the BBC

<p>She was one of television’s biggest names, before giving it all up to live on a farm. She talks about her friendship with Princess Diana, the horror of tabloid harassment – and the extraordinary sexism she faced<br /></p><p>Selina Scott has come in from the cold. She lights a fire and makes herself a cup of tea – black, no sugar. The former “golden girl” of the BBC lives on a farm in North Yorkshire with a couple of dogs, a handful of rare belted galloway cattle, a waddle of ducks and swans, and the odd otter. The room looks dark and bleak, and the internet isn’t working well, so we struggle to Zoom. “I’m going to move you into another room.” Scott still pronounces room aristocratically as “rum”, but her voice is different from the old days. Back then, it was more of a stately caress, offset by a youthful giggle. Today, her voice is deeper, more flinty, though still with a hint of grandeur. The Yorkshire roots of her childhood have re-emerged and planted themselves firmly in the peaty soil.</p><p>It’s 40 years since she made her name presenting News at 10, followed by BBC Breakfast Time, The Clothes Show, The Selina Scott Show for NBC, the magazine show West 57th for CBS and a brief stint at Sky. Scott wasn’t any old presenter. She bore an uncanny resemblance to Princess Diana (or, as she prefers it, the younger Diana bore an uncanny resemblance to her) and, like Diana, she became the nation’s sweetheart. Like Diana, she was hounded by the press – in a way that no other journalist has been. And like Diana she decided to walk away from it all at the peak of her fame. Unlike Diana, she lived to tell the tale.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/04/i-did-hate-tv-selina-scott-on-trump-prince-andrew-frank-bough-and-the-bbc">Continue reading...</a>

I would contend that the current generation of humans alive on Earth – having dealt over the past year with a global pandemic, incompetently attempted fascist takeovers, the fracturing and splintering of the world economy, and in some regions, the sky bursting into flame – has a more legitimate claim to that feeling than any that’s come before.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/06/films-set-in-2020-lessons">Apocalypse now-ish: what can we learn from films set in 2020?</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/04/film-movies-2021-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Refusing to extradite Assange to the US on mental health grounds is humane, but it doesn’t protect future whistleblowers</p><p>Julian Assange’s extradition to the US to face charges of espionage and hacking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/04/julian-assange-cannot-be-extradited-to-us-british-judge-rules">cannot take place</a>. This ruling by judge Vanessa Baraitser is a victory, albeit one not won on the principled grounds that should form the basis of opposing his extradition. The legal basis of the ruling is that “extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm”. The WikiLeaks founder has a “recurrent depressive disorder” and he was likely to be imprisoned in a supermax prison, where procedures would not prevent Assange “from finding a way to commit suicide”.</p><p>It is not to critique the soundness of Baraitser’s legal judgment to argue that this was the right decision, but for the wrong reason. That a British court has ruled that the US prison system is too barbaric to guarantee the safety of Assange tells its own story. But this is about something much bigger than Assange: it’s about journalism, the free press, and most importantly of all, the ability to expose atrocities committed by the world’s last remaining superpower.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/04/julian-assange-extradition-ruling-us-mental-health-whistleblowers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Neuropsychologists Chris Moulin and Céline Souchay, 47, fell in love after a conference in 2004. They live with their sons in Grenoble</p><p>Although Chris Moulin and Céline Souchay met at a scientific conference in France in 1999, they didn’t make a lasting impression on each other at the time. “I remember that Chris had long ginger hair,” says Céline. “I asked him some questions about a presentation he gave, but couldn’t understand his response, because my English wasn’t good.” She says he sounded “a bit posh and pretentious”, but it was “probably due to the language barrier”.</p><p>By 2004, Céline had moved from France to Plymouth to work as a lecturer, while Chris was living and working in Leeds. In September that year, he invited her to a British Psychological Society conference he was organising in the city. Although he had read her work, he didn’t recall having met her five years earlier. “She stood right next to me at the evening reception and I assumed she must fancy my PhD student,” says Chris. But Céline thought he was amazing. “I didn’t recognise him, but he looked so trendy and happy. I was frustrated, because I wanted to speak to him, but there were lots of people around. I stood nearby to show I was interested.” Although there was a spark, they kept things professional. “I asked him to read something I had written, as an excuse to keep in touch.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/04/how-we-met-she-stood-right-next-to-me-i-assumed-she-fancied-my-phd-student">Continue reading...</a>

As we learn about the damage ultra-processed foods wreak on our health (and the planet’s), we are also learning about “beneficial” foods to eat. And so to fermentation, an ancient preservation method that happens to be brilliant at stimulating and feeding our good gut bacteria. Chocolate, cheese, wine, kimchi, vinegars, coffee … it’s a happy coincidence, then, that their slowly developed flavours taste quite so good.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/04/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-kimchi-and-tofu-noodles-with-roast-brussels-sprouts">Continue reading...</a>

Wave upon wave of stormtroopers lie at every corner yet none can land a single shot and they topple like dominoes. Luke, Han and Leia use pilfered stormtrooper E-11 rifles, so Vader’s minions can’t even blame their tools.

<p>Somewhere between a soup and a risotto, this soothing dish is one to win over cabbage sceptics</p><p>The problem with liking cabbage so much is that I often smell of it. Not the most charismatic way to start a column, I know, especially the first of the year – happy new year! – but it is the truth, and a significant part of my eating life. As a child, I discovered that liking cabbage carried a risk: that of being called smelly, although this didn’t stop me eating all my school lunch, then offering to finish my friend’s. Young trauma faded into twentysomething worries about my sulphurous hair, although this didn’t stop me eating the cabbage soup I prescribed myself. But then, in my early 30s, I found myself living in a building that, thanks to a trattoria serving a typically Roman and therefore cruciferous menu, smelled more strongly of cabbage (also of broccoli, chicory and spinach) than I did. It was like meeting a kindred spirit, only made of bricks and cement; I fitted right in.</p><p>I am exaggerating, of course – but only slightly. Our building is a cabbage and broccoli bong much of the time; the sulphurous scent hanging around the courtyard and communal stairwells like fruit flies around half a melon in high summer. The smell is not alone: the bread shop, the bar dispatching espressos, bins and various degrees of home cooking all compete for airspace. But the scent of cabbage prevails. And I like the pong as much as the flavour of this great, green vegetable named after a head, especially deep-green savoy, with its blasted leaves and tree-like rib that taste like chlorophyll, iron, mustard and nutty butter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/04/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-rice-and-cabbage-soup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cheap, hygienic and sustainable, the mattresses made by Indian fashion designer Lakshmi Menon also generate income for rural women</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>At the height of the pandemic in the Indian state of Kerala, fashion designer Lakshmi Menon, 46, heard that every new Covid care centre had to have 50 beds. Mattresses were in short supply. Every time a patient was discharged, the mattress had to be incinerated. “I thought: that’s a lot of mattresses and a lot of burning,” says Menon.</p><p>Menon’s solution was to collect the mountains of plastic pieces from factories that make PPE – all the little bits left over after cutting. Women then braid the bits into rope-like plaits 6ft long. The braids are laid out in a zigzag and the ends tied together. The result is a light, soft, washable, hygienic mattress for just 300 rupees (£3) – half the price of a normal one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jan/04/project-turning-india-ppe-offcuts-mattresses-covid-patients">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A man who died falling from an aircraft while attempting to reach the UK had a friend on the same flight who survived and speaks in a new Channel 4 film, The Man Who Fell from the Sky </p><p>An almost unbearably painful moment comes halfway through a new Channel 4 documentary about the extraordinary story of a man who survived stowing away on a flight from Johannesburg to London – and his friend who didn’t make it. It happens when the daughter of the man who died is presented with the first photo of him she has ever seen by the makers of The Man Who Fell from the Sky. The film-makers had travelled to his native Mozambque, attempting to piece together the desperate bid for a new life he made in 2015. </p><p>“She doesn’t recognise him,” says her mother, Anna, as 11-year-old Chemilla looks at a picture of Carlito Vale on a mobile phone.

<p>Life was hard in this remote area of central Asia, until tourism offered new hope. Then Covid-19 struck and the visitors stopped coming</p><ul><li>Photographs by Danil Usmanov</li></ul><p>It has been over a decade since Umar Tashbekov saw his opportunity. His village, Sary-Mogol in Kyrgyzstan, at an altitude of 3,600 metres, is close to<strong> </strong>Lenin’s Peak, a popular mountain destination for tourists. If they were already hiking there, why not attract them to visit his village too?</p><p>Sary-Mogol is a three-hour drive from the nearest city of Osh, in the country’s south-east. Life here is not easy – short summers and unfavourable growing conditions make it hard to grow much more than potatoes and barley. The main source of work is the large livestock market in town. Others find employment as teachers or in the nearby coal mine. Out of its 5,200-strong population, about 500 people have left for Russia where companies welcome factory workers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jan/04/not-enough-work-not-enough-money-can-this-kyrgyz-village-survive-without-tourists-a-picture-essay">Continue reading...</a>

## Subtle and soothing: my obsession with Thai massaman curry – plus the recipe

<p>A literary interview over dinner in Bangkok led to the mild, Muslim-influenced dish becoming a fixture in our writer’s London kitchen</p><p>In 2015 the Observer Magazine sent me to Thailand to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/feb/07/lawrence-osborne-novelist-interview-graham-greene-thailand">interview the novelist Lawrence Osborne</a>. He first went to Bangkok for the cheap dentistry, but found the city so conducive to work that he stuck around. Like many expats, Osborne lives in the central Asoke district, just off the busy Sukhumvit road. He writes late at night, when the chaos and heat of the daytime have died down and the only sounds are tree frogs and the odd barking dog. We conducted the interview over dinner at <a href="http://www.thelocalthaicuisine.com/">The Local</a>, a quiet one-storey Thai restaurant round the corner from his flat, and it was there that I had my first massaman curry, at the grand old age of 28. I’d eaten plenty of Thai food, so I’m not sure how I managed to last so long without trying it, but I succumbed at once. Compared with some of the restaurant’s other dishes, which were so fiery I wanted to call the police, this had a deep warmth that was rich and reassuring rather than a gun to the head.</p><p>Although it has been a Thai staple for hundreds of years, massaman originated in India, or possibly Persia – accounts differ – and often features cumin, cinnamon, cloves and cardamom along with the more familiar galangal, chillis, shrimp paste and lemongrass. “Massaman is not meant to be spicy,” says Sirachai Kularbwong, the chef at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/singburi_e11/?hl=en">Singburi</a> in Leytonstone, east London – quite possibly the UK’s best Thai restaurant. “The ideal profile should be initially slightly sour, then becoming sweet and savoury. The point is to taste the subtle fragrances and spices that went into the dish.” For shop-bought paste, he recommends the Mae Ploy brand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/jan/04/my-obsession-with-thai-massaman-curry-bangkok">Continue reading...</a>

After years of research, he believes he has the answer</p><p><strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> talks to <strong>Dr Andrew Jenkinson</strong>, a consultant in bariatric (weight-loss) surgery. He discusses how his patients’ experiences of failed weight loss led him to spend years researching metabolism and weight reduction. Why is it that although most people consume food with too many calories, only some become obese? </p><p>Genes predispose you to obesity, he says, but your genetics need to be triggered by environmental change for you to become obese. In areas of the world where populations eat local, fresh ingredients, populations do not become obese. But if you change that food supply to processed food, some of that populations will become obese.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2021/jan/04/why-do-some-people-find-it-harder-than-others-to-lose-weight">Continue reading...</a>
