Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan

Unfortunately, we expect this to get worse before it gets better. 

Our health system will not continue to cope with this level of impact

We have also seen a significant increase in positive laboratory tests in recent days reflecting a true increase in the incidence of the disease

South African form, pretty substantial changes in the structure of the protein

My gut feeling is the vaccine will be still effective against the Kent strain.

I don’t know about the South African strain – there’s a big question mark about that

South African strain, 501.V2, two locations in Britain

it’s increased the infectiousness, probably by increasing its ability to bind to the human cells

Perfectly possible, to adjust vaccines in a matter of weeks if necessary
