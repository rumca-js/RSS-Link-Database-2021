Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, Kyle and Ethan talk to comedian, author, and political satirist  Andrew Heaton. Andrew has performed stand up comedy all over the world and hosts two podcasts, one of them featuring Kyle and Ethan. Andrew’s two podcasts are titled The Political Orphanage and Alienating the Audience. Kyle and Ethan dive into Andrew’s strange Oklahoma upbringing that deals with a Prison rodeo, eating a rattlesnake heart, and having unknown ties to a family cave. While on his journey out of Oklahoma, Andrew worked for a time at congress and tells Kyle and Ethan about how that experience helped shape him to become politically homeless.
