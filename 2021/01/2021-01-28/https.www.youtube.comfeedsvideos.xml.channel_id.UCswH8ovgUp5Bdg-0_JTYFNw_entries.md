This week, the World Economic Forum reprised its annual meeting, albeit virtually, organised around “The Great Reset,” its effort to rethink the global economy. How do we separate the various conspiracy theories associated with the WEF from the genuinely dangerous ideas lurking beneath its stated agenda?

Try this 3 minute Kundalini exercise for emotional balance! How did you get on? What would you like to see next?

I am not a kundalini teacher - I am a student like you - let's try this together

Here are a few guidelines:

Before practicing this meditation drink a glass of water.

Sit in easy pose.

MUDRA 
- Place the arms across the chest and lock hands under the armpits, with palms open and against the body. 
- Raise the shoulders up tightly against the earlobes without cramping the neck muscles.
-  Apply Neck Lock.

EYE POSITION: Close the eyes.

BREATH: The breath will automatically become slow.

TIME: Continue for 3 minutes, gradually increasing to 11 minutes.

This meditation is called Sunia(n) Antar. It is very good for women. It is essential at times when one is worried or upset and doesn’t know what to do, or when one feels like screaming, yelling and misbehaving. When out of focus or emotional, attention should be given to the body’s water balance and breath rate. Humans are approximately 70% water, and behaviour depends upon the relation of water and earth, air and ether. Breath, representing air and ether, is the rhythm of life.

Normally we breathe 15 times a minute, but when we are able to rhythmically slow down the breath to only four breaths per minute, we have indirect control over our minds. This control eliminates obnoxious behaviour, promoting a calm mind regardless of the state of affairs.

When there is a water balance in the system and the kidneys are under pressure, it can cause worry and upset. Drinking water, pulling the shoulders up to the ears and tightly locking the entire upper area creates a solid brake that can be applied to the four sides of the brain. After 2/3minutes thoughts will still be there, but one does not feel them. This is a very effective method of balancing the functional brain.
