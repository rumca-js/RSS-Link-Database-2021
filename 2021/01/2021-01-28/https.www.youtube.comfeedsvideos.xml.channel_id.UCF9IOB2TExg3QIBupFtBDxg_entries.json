January - REACT-1 round 8 final report\n\nEngland during January 2021\n\nHigh average prevalence\n\nRegional heterogeneity of trends\n\nSARS-CoV-2 infection in the community \n\nREACT-1 survey of prevalence in the community in England\n\nRepeated cross-sectional samples of the population\n\nBetween 6th and 22nd January 2021\n\nN = 167,642 results\n\nPositive results = 2,282 were positive\n\nGiving a weighted national prevalence of infection of 1.57% \n\n(95% CI, 1.49%, 1.66%)\n\nNo strong evidence for either growth or decay averaged over the period 6th to 22nd January 2021\n\nR number over this period was estimated at 0.98 \n\n(0.92, 1.04)\n\nWhy not more reduction in cases?\n\nHigher average levels of mobility\n\nMore people allowed to physically attend their workplace\n\nA larger number of children eligible to attend school\n\nHigher intrinsic transmissibility of the new variant\n\n\nTrend during 6th Jan to 22nd Jan\n\nPrevalence remained high throughout, with suggestion of a decline\n\nRegional heterogeneity\n\nDecreasing prevalence in South West\n\nIncreasing prevalence in East Midlands\n\nPrevalence during 6th Jan to 22nd Jan\n\nPrevalence highest in London at 2.83%\n\nPrevalence nationally highest in age 18 to 24 year, 2.44%\n\nThose over 65 years, 0.93%\n\nCorrelations for higher prevalence\n\nLarge household size\n\nSingle person households, 1.24% \n\nHouseholds of seven or more people, 3.05% \n\nLiving in a deprived neighbourhood\n\nTwo most deprived quintiles, prevalence of 1.79%\n\nTwo highest quintiles, 1.22%\n\nBlack and Asian

1.35%\n\nOther key workers\n\nContext\n\nPrevalence of infection in early to mid January 2021\u2026\n\nHighest since May 2020\n\nHigh and rapidly increasing prevalence in the second wave\n\nPartly, more transmissible strain\n\nFirst observed in southern England in September 2020\n\nConclusion\n\nInfection remain much higher than those seen during lockdown in May 2020\n\nShallower downward trajectory\n\nUnless the prevalence of infection in the community can be lowered substantially \n\nThe extreme pressure on health services will continue over the coming weeks \u2026 \n\nand possibly months, \n\nuntil the vaccination programme protects sufficient numbers of at-risk individuals \n\nEssential that we continue to observe public health measures,\n\nIncluding social distancing, face covers, hand-washing and isolation of cases \n\nIf sustained lower prevalence is not achieved rapidly in England, pressure on healthcare services and numbers of COVID-19 deaths will remain unacceptably high.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KFIhQsU70", "date_published": "2021-01-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
