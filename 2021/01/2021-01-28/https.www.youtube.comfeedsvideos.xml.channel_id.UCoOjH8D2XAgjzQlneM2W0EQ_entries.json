One year later, that number is at 6.7 trillion dollars. Meaning that over 40% of all US dollars were printed in just the last 12 months. And from the looks of it, no one seems to be in a rush to slow things down. And strangely enough, we haven\u2019t seen much inflation for everyday goods like gas and food? Prices definitely haven\u2019t gone up anywhere near 40%?. Where\u2019s the inflation?\n\nThe reason why we haven\u2019t seen inflation is because the amount of money being printed is only one of the factors that contributes to inflation\nTo get inflation, here\u2019s everything you need:\n1. Industrial Output: how much \u201cstuff\u201d an economy makes\n2. Employment\nToo much employment leads to employers fighting over workers, which leads to higher wages, which leads to higher prices\n3. The Money Supply: the main topic of this video and probably the easiest to understand\nMore money when an economy is producing the same amount or less stuff equals higher prices\nAnd 4. If money is exchanging hands, and if so, how fast is it exchanging hands, or the Velocity of Money\n\nAnd in our case right now, the money supply has shot up a ridiculous amount, but the other factors have been keeping inflation down\nIndustrial Output: It\u2019s been down from businesses not being able to operate, which means less stuff. But there\u2019s also less demand from you and I to buy those things.\nEmployment has also definitely taken a hit. And with less employment comes lower wages, which means lower prices. Not inflation.\nAnd the Velocity of Money. It\u2019s pretty slow for everyone with all the uncertainty in the air. People don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money right now if they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re gonna be able to find a job or keep their job\nBut you know what they are gonna spend it on? The things that only go up! Like Tesla stock, every other stock, real estate, and Bitcoin!\nBut instead of calling it inflation, we call it the stock market rally, \n\n-----------------------\n\nPhilanthrope, Leavv - What Was Before https://chll.to/7764bee5 \n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
