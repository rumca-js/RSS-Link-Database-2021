Ah, Cyberpunk 2077, the worlds least controversial video game. In the making for nearly a decade it is finally here and oh boy, is it an absolute nightmare. In this video I talk at length about CD Projekt Red, The Witcher 3, triple A gaming as a whole, and of course Cyberpunk 2077 at length.

Generally I think of Cyberpunk 2077 pretty positively, as a video game it tries to do too much and some areas fall flat, but generally I can ignore this stuff and focus on the games main story, which is where I think CD Projekt Red did their game proud.

Although I liked Cyberpunk 2077 I ended up focusing mostly on it’s negatives in this video, the series is called “absolute nightmare” after all. This wasn’t entirely intentional, it’s just Cyberpunk 2077 is such a big game that was rushed out there is a lot of issues to find. 

The Cyberpunk 2077 style mask I wear was made by my friend Sam Hoile. It fits the games mood perfectly so I hope you all liked it! All the Cyberpunk 2077 glitch style editing was just done by me using stock footage and jumpcuts.
