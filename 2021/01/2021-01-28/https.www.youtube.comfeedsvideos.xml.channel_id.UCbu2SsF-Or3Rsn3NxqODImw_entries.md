How a great idea to merge Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Warzone, and Modern Warfare lead to confusing purchases, overpowered guns, and challenges that didn’t please either audience.

Call Of Duty recently merged progression, a season pass, and some guns across Cold War, Warzone, and Modern Warfare. In theory, it was a great idea that would allow any Call Of Duty player to engage in any mode and carry progress across games. In reality Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is a more traditional Call Of Duty title with a different audience from the mil-sim inspired Modern Warfare, so the merger has resulted in Warzone challenges that don’t appeal to Cold War players, erased or made meaningless progress for Modern Warfare players, overpowered guns like the Mac-10 and DMR 14 in Warzone, and created unlocks that some players can’t use unless they purchased the other title. 

In this video, we talk about what we feel Activision was trying to achieve, why it’s a good idea in theory, why it isn’t working yet, and what they can focus on next. Call Of Duty titles published by Activision are developed by multiple studios including Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Raven Software, and Sledgehammer Games. This is the first time progress has been linked across two separate games and a standalone free-to-play battle-royale. We have yet to see if this shared ecosystem will be used moving forward for all Call Of Duty titles, but there are lessons to be learned either way.

Thanks to Capcom’s recent Resident Evil showcase, we learned lots of juicy details about the upcoming Resident Evil 8, known as Resident Evil Village. We got our first look at gameplay and have a clearer picture of the game’s plot as well as some of its villains.

In this video, Jean-Luc breaks down all the important details you need to know about Village. When is it coming out? How does this tie into Resident Evil 7? And what's the deal with that tall vampire lady that keeps showing up on my social media feed? All of these questions and more are answered.

Capcom also released the PS5 exclusive Maiden demo, which acts as a visual showcase for Village. If you don’t own a PS5 and would like to see the demo for yourself, we captured the whole thing and you can watch it right here on our YouTube channel. Make sure to come back to GameSpot for more Resident Evil Village coverage as we get closer to the game’s May 7th release for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC as well as PS4 and Xbox One.
