Operation Warp Speed

Engineered viral protein, with a plant-based ingredient

Normal fridge

UK, N = 15,000

Over the age of 65, n = 4,000

NVX-CoV2373 

Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine Demonstrates 89.3% Efficacy in UK Phase 3 Trial

First to Demonstrate Clinical Efficacy Against UK and South Africa Variants

51% of phase 3 participants had new UK variant

Efficacy against old strain = 95.6% 

Efficacy against new variant = 85.6% 

Based on 62 cases

56 cases in the placebo group

6 cases in the vaccine group

Of the 62 cases, 61 were mild or moderate, and 1 was severe (in placebo group).

Safety

Interim analysis

Severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events occurred at low levels

Balanced between vaccine and placebo groups

Clive Dix, Chair, UK Vaccine Taskforce

These are spectacular results 

The efficacy shown against the emerging variants is also extremely encouraging

South Africa Novavax Results

N = 4,400

Phase 2b clinical trial

Approximately 92.6% of cases attributed to South Africa variant 

Triple mutant variant, 3 critical mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD)

Multiple mutations outside the RBD


HIV Negative participants

94% of the study population was HIV-negative

60% efficacy for disease prevention

One severe case in the placebo group

All other cases mild or moderate

HIV-positive participants (19% of adults)

49.4% efficacy

Also about South Africa

Prior infection with COVID-19 may not completely protect against subsequent infection by the South Africa escape variant

Vaccination with NVX-CoV2373 provided significant protection

Novavax, working on a vaccine specifically targeted to the variant

Novavax, US and Mexico phase 3 trial

Significant progress on PREVENT-19 Clinical Trial in US and Mexico

PREVENT-19 has randomized over 16,000 participants

Complete targeted enrolment of 30,000 patients in the first half of February

Phase 3, ENSEMBLE, 29th January

N = 43,783

468 symptomatic cases

Efficacy in preventing disease

66% effective overall in preventing disease

United States, 72% efficacy

Latin America, 66% 

South Africa, 57%

28 days post-vaccination

Onset of protection was observed as early as day 14

Efficacy in preventing severe disease at 28 days

Globally, 85 % 

Demonstrated complete protection against COVID-related hospitalization and death, 28 days post-vaccination. 

In all adults 18 years and older

Efficacy against severe disease increased over time, with no cases in vaccinated participants reported after day 49




Protection

Generally consistent across race, age groups, including adults over 60 years of age (N= 13,610)

Including South Africa where nearly all cases B.1.351 lineage

Safety Data

Independent group of experts

Did not report any significant safety concerns

Vaccine candidate was generally well-tolerated. 

Fever rates were 9%

Overall serious adverse events (SAEs) reported were higher in participants who received placebo as compared to the active vaccine candidate

No anaphylaxis was observed

Rollout

About £7 per dose (not for profit)

UK, ordered 30 million doses

Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) Study

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research-and-impact/groups/react-study/

Imperial College London

Commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care, 

Ipsos MORI

Antigen and antibody testing surveys

Repeated, non-overlapping, cross-sectional surveys, of random samples of the population 

Self-administered throat and nose swabs and questionnaire data 

Irrespective of symptoms

To estimate community-wide prevalence

Unbiased by testing availability or behaviour. 

28 January - REACT-1 round 8 final report

England during January 2021

High average prevalence

Regional heterogeneity of trends

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community 

REACT-1 survey of prevalence in the community in England

Repeated cross-sectional samples of the population

Between 6th and 22nd January 2021

N = 167,642 results

Positive results = 2,282 were positive

Giving a weighted national prevalence of infection of 1.57% 

(95% CI, 1.49%, 1.66%)

No strong evidence for either growth or decay averaged over the period 6th to 22nd January 2021

R number over this period was estimated at 0.98 

(0.92, 1.04)

Why not more reduction in cases?

Higher average levels of mobility

More people allowed to physically attend their workplace

A larger number of children eligible to attend school

Higher intrinsic transmissibility of the new variant


Trend during 6th Jan to 22nd Jan

Prevalence remained high throughout, with suggestion of a decline

Regional heterogeneity

Decreasing prevalence in South West

Increasing prevalence in East Midlands

Prevalence during 6th Jan to 22nd Jan

Prevalence highest in London at 2.83%

Prevalence nationally highest in age 18 to 24 year, 2.44%

Those over 65 years, 0.93%

Correlations for higher prevalence

Large household size

Single person households, 1.24% 

Households of seven or more people, 3.05% 

Living in a deprived neighbourhood

Two most deprived quintiles, prevalence of 1.79%

Two highest quintiles, 1.22%

Black and Asian ethnicity

Black and Asian ethnicity, increased prevalence, 3.07%

White participants, 1.14% 

Healthcare and care home workers

Healthcare and care home workers, 1.48%
Other workers, 1.35%

Other key workers

Context

Prevalence of infection in early to mid January 2021…

Highest since May 2020

High and rapidly increasing prevalence in the second wave

Partly, more transmissible strain

First observed in southern England in September 2020

Conclusion

Infection remain much higher than those seen during lockdown in May 2020

Shallower downward trajectory

Unless the prevalence of infection in the community can be lowered substantially 

The extreme pressure on health services will continue over the coming weeks … 

and possibly months, 

until the vaccination programme protects sufficient numbers of at-risk individuals 

Essential that we continue to observe public health measures,

Including social distancing, face covers, hand-washing and isolation of cases 

If sustained lower prevalence is not achieved rapidly in England, pressure on healthcare services and numbers of COVID-19 deaths will remain unacceptably high.
