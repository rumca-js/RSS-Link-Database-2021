Four years ago, Oregon trio Joseph played at The Current's 12th birthday party show at First Avenue in Minneapolis. Their set featured songs from their 2016 album, "I'm Alone, No You're Not," and six months prior to the show at First Avenue, Joseph visited The Current studio to play songs from that album just ahead of its release.
