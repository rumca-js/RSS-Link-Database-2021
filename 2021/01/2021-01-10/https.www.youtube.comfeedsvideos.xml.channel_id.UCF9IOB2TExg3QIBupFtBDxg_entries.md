Prof Chris Whitty, CMO

Next weeks, most dangerous time

This is everybody's problem. 

Any single unnecessary contact you have with someone is a potential link in a chain of transmission that will lead to a vulnerable person

UK, 1 in 50

London, 1 in 30

Exercise should be minimised with other people

English hospitals

Over 30,000

Peak last April, 18,000

Anybody who is not shocked by the number of people in hospital

has not understood this at all

This is an appalling situation

Essex, Southend Hospital

Oxygen supply, reached a critical situation

Titrating to 88 – 92%

Surrey

Hospital mortuaries have reached capacity

Emergency site, almost 200 bodies 

Government

Reliable data on existing measures in 10 days

Mr Hancock

Two million people in the UK had been vaccinated

England, 200,000 daily

Follow the spirit as well as the letter of the rules

Every time you try to flex the rules that could be fatal

Staying at home, most important thing we can do collectively as a society

Vaccination target

UK, 15 million, by mid-February

Over-70s

Healthcare workers

Shielding

Some 600,000 invitations were due to be sent out over the weekend 

Why not use bigger vials?

Nadhim Zahawi 

Different age groups in this second wave

Infections highest in recent months

Teenagers

Students

Young adults, 20s and 30s

Therefore more getting sick and hospitalised

Overall pattern of seriously illness or death, not changed significantly

Risk of death, doubles about every eight years

## US and Europe, increases

Will get vaccinated next week

Urged people to get the injection

There is a suicidal denial which I cannot explain, but today we have to get vaccinated

I believe that ethically everyone should take the vaccine

It is an ethical choice because you are gambling with your health, with your life, but you are also gambling with the lives of others

SARS-CoV-2 Transmission From People Without COVID-19 Symptoms
(JAMA, 7th January)

US CDC based meta analysis

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=010721

Importance

What are the drivers of infection?

Objective

Assess transmission via:

Presymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic

Results

Incubation period, a median of 5 days

Infectious period duration, 10 days

30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms

75% of these are as infectious as symptomatics

Proportions of transmissions

From infected people who never develop symptoms, 24% of all transmission

From presymptomatics, 35% of all transmission

Therefore 59% of all transmission

Therefore 41% of all transmission from symptomatics

Conclusions and Relevance

Effective control of spread, reducing the risk of transmission from people with infection who do not have symptoms
