drivers of infection?\n\nObjective\n\nAssess transmission via:\n\nPresymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic\n\nResults\n\nIncubation period, a median of 5 days\n\nInfectious period duration, 10 days\n\n30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms\n\n75% of these are as infectious as symptomatics\n\nProportions of transmissions\n\nFrom infected people who never develop symptoms, 24% of all transmission\n\nFrom presymptomatics, 35% of all transmission\n\nTherefore 59% of all transmission\n\nTherefore 41% of all transmission from symptomatics\n\nConclusions and Relevance\n\nEffective control of spread, reducing the risk of transmission from people with infection who do not have symptoms", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1utnG0ohSYQ",
