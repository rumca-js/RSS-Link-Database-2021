As the new year gets fully underway, commercially-available boards for the Compute Module 4 are finally becoming available!

In this video, I talk about two boards I recently received in the mail, the Waveshare Compute Module 4 PoE board, and the Sourcekit PiTray mini.

Find them online:

  - Waveshare PoE board: https://www.waveshare.com/compute-module-4-poe-board.htm
  - Sourcekit PiTray mini: https://sourcekit.cc/#/

Full disclosure: I bought the Waveshare for the full price + shipping, but the PiTray mini was kindly sent to me by Sourcekit for early testing.
