To Swag Academy's credit, upon learning that the information was 100% wrong, immediately deleted his video and issued an apology. Because of this, there is no feud between me and Swag Academy. This is not Internet drama, it's a disgusting tactic used by anonymous 'gurus' who are angry that their predatory lies have been exposed. I believe at the end of the day that Swag Academy made an unbelievably stupid error, but that he wouldn't have published the info had he known it was false. He has apologized to my wife and I, and while his initial response was COMPLETELY unwarranted and out of proportion, this is over between myself and him.  \n\nThe second part of this video is dedicated to the anonymous harassment and blackmail campaign I've been on the receiving end of since early 2020ish, the dates are a bit fuzzy at this point.  I've been hunting down the perpetrators of this and have IP logged some of them, received blackmail and other emails suggesting this is the work of some fragile millionaires upset with the work that I do on this channel.   \ntwitter: https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT\ninstagram: https://www.instagram.com/coffeebreak_yt/\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:22 Part I: Responding to Swag Academy's Accusations\n5:59 Part II: The Harassment and Blackmail Campaign\n7:04 The Harassment Begins\n10:24 The Hunt Begins - Finding Anonymous\n14:01 The First Clue\n15:56 The Two Dan Lok Videos\n19:06 To Catfish a Guru\n23:55 Conclusion", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJCWbv6laHA", "date_published": "2021-01-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
