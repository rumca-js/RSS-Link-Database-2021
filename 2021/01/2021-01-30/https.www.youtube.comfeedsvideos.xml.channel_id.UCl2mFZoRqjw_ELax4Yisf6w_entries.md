To be clear I am not saying that they don't make good points about it being a bad idea to YOLO all of your money into an actual meme stock. I am just tired of the one dimensional, cookie cutter blogger style reporting that is becoming so much more pervasive even on paid outlets. For $40/mo, I demand better. My videos suck but at least they're free!
