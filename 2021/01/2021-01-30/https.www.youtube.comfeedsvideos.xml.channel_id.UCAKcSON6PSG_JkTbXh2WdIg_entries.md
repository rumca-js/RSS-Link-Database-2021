Sunday, Jan. 31, 2021, marks the one-year anniversary of the release of Poliça's fifth studio album, "When We Stay Alive." Around the time of the release, Poliça visited The Current studio to record performances of three songs from the album. The session took a whole new approach: incorporating creative lighting design into the in-studio performance, what emerged was something that looks like music videos or a live stage show. Watch performances from that unforgettable session with Poliça.
