Medical professionals and the public

Identifying people with COVID, who might be most likely to need medical care

Monitored appropriately and get to hospital quickly should it become necessary

If you’re in the red or dark red zone you should contact your doctor for advice

Ask if they can send you a pulse oximeter

Check HR and temp regularly

Wherever you fall on the chart, 

if you are struggling to breathe, 

have pain in your chest, 

become very confused or drowsy

or your lips or face are turning blue, 

you should call an ambulance

WHO official investigating pandemic warns world to 'manage expectations' as team leaves quarantine

Dutch virologist, Marion Koopmans

I think we really have to manage expectations, 

if you look at some of the earlier quests for the origins of outbreaks, 

they have taken years to complete.

undisclosed information

has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019,

before the first identified case, 

with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses

Lab had been carrying out research on a bat coronavirus

The CCP has prevented independent journalists, investigators, and global health authorities from interviewing researchers at the WIV

Chinese authorities, virus was a US military biological weapon

Lancet, 18th November

In participants who received two doses of vaccine, 

median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts

18–55 years (n = 39)

56–69 years (n=26)

more than 70 years (n=47)

By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (more than 99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. 

T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19

Professor John Bell, Oxford University vaccine team

I’m not sure where he got that from

Other studies proved elderly people responded just as well in other age groups

there's really persuasive evidence that this is a protective vaccine in those populations
