The session took a whole new approach: incorporating creative lighting design into the in-studio performance, what emerged was something that looks like music videos or a live stage show. Watch performances from that unforgettable session with Poli\u00e7a.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Driving\"\n3:35 \"Steady\"\n7:00 \"Forget Me Now\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nChanny Leaneagh \u2013 vocals \nChris Bierden \u2013 bass  and vocals \nDrew Christopherson \u2013 drums\nBen Ivascu \u2013 drums \nRyan Olson \u2013 producer\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2011 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/11/30/polica-live\n2013 session in the MPR Forum: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/10/09/polica-ubs-forum-live\n2016 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/02/01/polica-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2020 studio session: \nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/02/04/polica-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#polica #thisispolica", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuckBJooRzQ", "date_published": "2021-01-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
