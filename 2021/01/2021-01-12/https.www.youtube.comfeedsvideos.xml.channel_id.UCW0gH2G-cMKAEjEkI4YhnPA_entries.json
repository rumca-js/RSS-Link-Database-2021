In this short-notice stream, we'll breakdown some of the clues in the synopsis and make some educated guesses on what we will see in the show!\n\nAmazon Studios\u2019 forthcoming series brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth\u2019s history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien\u2019s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of N\u00famenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.\n\n#LOTRonPrime #LOTR #Tolkien", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY7Bl2A-Bzg", "date_published": "2021-01-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
