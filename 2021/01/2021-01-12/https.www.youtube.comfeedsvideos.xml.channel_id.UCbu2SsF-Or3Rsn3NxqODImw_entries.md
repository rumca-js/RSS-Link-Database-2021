Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has recently dropped an optimization update to create postprocessed 4k 30fps, and 1080p 60fps gameplay for the Xbox Series X|S, and the PlayStation 5.

While we're waiting for new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S games to launch, there's plenty of time to revisit some favorites on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Luckily for us, developers are optimizing those games for the brand-new consoles.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is one of those titles, and has received a next-gen optimization update. The new update improves framerate and dynamic resolution ranges on the Xbox Series X|S as well as the PlayStation 5. The update also improves post-processing resolution on the Series X and PS5 but not the Series S. 

In the video above, we play Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order on an Xbox Series X first running in 4k Postprocessing Mode and then in 1080p 60fps Performance Mode.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, developed by Respawn Entertainment, is out now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Stadia.
