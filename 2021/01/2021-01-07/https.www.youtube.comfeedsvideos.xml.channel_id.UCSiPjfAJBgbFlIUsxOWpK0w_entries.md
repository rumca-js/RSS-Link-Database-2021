LYRICS

Red One

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sad

We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastico

Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sad

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Paparazzi

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sad

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful
