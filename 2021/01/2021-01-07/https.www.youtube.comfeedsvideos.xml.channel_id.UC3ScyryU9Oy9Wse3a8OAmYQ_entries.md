In this excerpt from the new documentary “A Thousand Cuts,” Ressa, a 2018 TIME Person of the Year, describes her approach and her findings — and gives insight into what can happen to democracy when press freedom is threatened and disinformation flourishes on social media. Content warning: The examples of online abuse in the above clip include a screengrab of a graphic sexual comment.
