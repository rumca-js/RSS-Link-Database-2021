D\n\nhttps://vitamindforall.org/letter.html\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00513/full\n\nVitamin D modulates thousands of genes and many aspects of immune function, both innate and adaptive. \n\nHigher vitamin D blood levels are associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. \n\n\nHigher D levels are associated with lower risk of a severe case (hospitalization, ICU, or death). \n\nIntervention studies (including RCTs) indicate that vitamin D can be a very effective treatment. \n\nMany papers reveal several biological mechanisms by which vitamin D influences COVID-19. \n\nCausal inference modelling, Hill\u2019s criteria, the intervention studies & the biological mechanisms indicate that vitamin D\u2019s influence on COVID-19 is very likely causal, not just correlation.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3849fI4yIeo", "date_published": "2021-01-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
