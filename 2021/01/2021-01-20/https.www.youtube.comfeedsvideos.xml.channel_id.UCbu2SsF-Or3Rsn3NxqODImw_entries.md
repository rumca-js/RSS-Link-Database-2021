The biggest improvements and features we want to see come to the next-generation consoles in 2021.

2021 will be the first full year of the newest generation of consoles as more people get their hands on PS5s and Xbox Series X/S, and more games start to come out. Both had solid launches, despite issues of supply shortage, but there’s a lot more we want to see out of these systems.

In this video, Jean-Luc Seipke breaks down our wish list of tweaks and improvements for these systems. From simple requests like more controller colors to larger, more ambitious demands, like PS3 games made backwards compatible on the PS5, there are a ton of things we’d like to see.

Let us know what you’d like to see from the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 in 2021! If you’re excited for more new generation games, why not check out our videos detailing the hottest games coming out this year. We got ones for both Xbox Series X|S and the PlayStation 5.

From Dead Space 2’s eye gouging, to P.T.’s beauty queen Lisa, Kurt breaks down 8 of gaming’s most terrifying moments you wish you forgot.

With Resident Evil Village right around the corner, Kurt Indovina thought it’d be a good time to go over some horrifying moments in games that most of us wish we could unsee. 

Unlike movies, horror in games just hit different. Whether it’s tip-toeing around Jack Baker in Resident Evil 7 or scrambling to look away from Lisa in P.T., spooky moments in games are escalated by having a controller in your hands. Some games are a bit more psychological about it, like Eternal Darkness, which draws its horror from toying with a gamer's deepest paranoias. Or in the case of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, it's in showing less is actually a whole lot more terrifying.

So join Kurt as he details the 8 scariest moments in games that made us squirm, screech, and flail in fright.
