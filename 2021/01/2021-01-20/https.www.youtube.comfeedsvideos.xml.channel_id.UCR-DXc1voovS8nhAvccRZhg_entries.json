It uses a brand new custom dual-core Arm M0+ processor, the RP2040.\n\nWhat makes it tick, and how is it to use it? Why buy it instead of another microcontroller, or even a Raspberry Pi Zero that's only a dollar more? I'll answer all these questions in this comprehensive review of the Pico!\n\nCheck out the Raspberry Pi Pico: https://rptl.io/pico\n\nAnd here's a blog post for this video: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/raspberry-pi-pico-new-4-microcontroller\n\nMentioned in this video:\n\n  - Baby Safe Temperature Monitor on GitHub: https://github.com/geerlingguy/baby-safe-temp\n  - My older Raspberry Pi Temperature Monitoring App on GitHub: https://github.com/geerlingguy/temperature-monitor\n  - OpenSource.com Post on the Temperature Monitor: https://opensource.com/life/16/3/how-i-use-raspberry-pis-help-my-kids-sleep-better\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\n\n#RaspberryPi #Pico #Microcontroller\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - tl;dw - The Pico\n00:58 - A Pico Project\n02:07 - Pico Specs and Comparisons\n03:54 - Get started with Pico\n04:41 - Pico vs Pi Zero?\n05:47 - What do microcontrollers do?\n06:25 - Baby Safe Temperature Monitor\n07:38 - Build montage!\n08:44 - Does it work?\n09:37 - Minor gripes and verdict\n10:41 - Thanks and Bloopers", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUCgYXF01Do", "date_published": "2021-01-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg", "title": "Kubernetes 101 - Episode 7 - Hello, Operator!", "description": "In this episode, we\u2019ll explore the concept of a Kubernetes Operator, and how they allow you to manage applications running in Kubernetes clusters more efficiently.
