The Champion is a comedy film released in 1915 by Essanay Studios, starring Charles Chaplin alongside Edna Purviance and Leo White. Essanay co-owner and star, Broncho Billy Anderson can be seen as an enthusiastic audience member in the boxing match scene.

Restoration work was carried out by Fondazione Cineteca di Bologna and Lobster Films in collaboration with Film Preservation Associates, from a nitrate dupe negative preserved at the British Film Institute. Some fragments were added from an incomplete di-acetate fine grain from the Cinémathèque française, and an original nitrate print preserved at the Archives françaises du film (CNC).

Intertitles have been reconstructed from re-release titles of the 1920's found in both 35mm and Kodascope 16mm original elements.

In this tutorial I will show you how to colorize any black & white photo online. You don't need to install anything. We will by using DeOldify for this, AI model trained on thousands of B&W and color photo pairs, so that it understands relationship between them, and apply it to given input photo.

Result is not historically accurate, its not accurate at all, but it gives photos new feel and look. Missing colors and details are filled by our brain, so that at first glance it looks very convincing.

Amazing job Jason Antic!
