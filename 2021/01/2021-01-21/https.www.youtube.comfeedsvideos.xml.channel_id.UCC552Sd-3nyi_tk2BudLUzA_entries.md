While everyone was watching the inauguration we were getting DEBUNKED! We made a video about the science of skincare, retinol and vitamin C. LabMuffin aka Michelle Wong stepped in to let us know some of the nuances we got wrong, and to ignite a brilliant discussion about the science of skincare, how products are sold to us, lol at the new Jennifer Lopez skin care line logline, and how you can best choose your skincare products based on SCIENCE. We also talked about skincare myths, battled it out about bad skincare studies and learned that with skincare we need to be less picky about our science research.
