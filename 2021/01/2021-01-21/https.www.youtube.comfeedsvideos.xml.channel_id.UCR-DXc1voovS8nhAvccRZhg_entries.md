The Raspberry Pi Foundation today introduced a new $4 microcontroller board, the Pico. It uses a brand new custom dual-core Arm M0+ processor, the RP2040.

What makes it tick, and how is it to use it? Why buy it instead of another microcontroller, or even a Raspberry Pi Zero that's only a dollar more? I'll answer all these questions in this comprehensive review of the Pico!
