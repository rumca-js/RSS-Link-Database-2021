The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

There's a distinct dissonance between the bucolic setting of this lovely Max Richter Tiny Desk (home) concert and the reality he references after his performance.

"Looking forward to the time when gigs can come back and we can do this for real," the composer says, leaving us with a yearning that is borne out in his tranquil, probing music.

These half-dozen short pieces can offer two very different modes of experience. Shot in artful black and white, their simplicity and beauty invite us into a world as we once knew it, where fresh air wafts through open doors and dogs peacefully snooze (canine cameos by Evie and Haku) in the late summer sunshine in southern England.

On the other hand, the chaos found in the real world we know today can find a balm in Richter's soothing, oscillating figures in "Infra 3" or the gently swaying chords of "Origins," where the music lumbers in the lower half of the keyboard.

There's a mysterious potency in instrumental music, where the mind is open to wander and free-associate. Max Richter taps into that power with singular grace and humanity.

SET LIST
"Vladimir's Blues"
"Origins"
"Infra 3"
"Horizon Variations"
"Prelude 6"
"Fragment"

Sincerest apologies to Stefan Babcock's neighbors: For PUP's Tiny Desk (home) concert, the Toronto group refused to dial down the volume, filling Babcock's neatly-furnished living room – complete with an Ontario pennant – and just maybe making a few enemies down the street in the process.

"My neighbors hate us, and I don't blame them," Babcock said. Volume complaints aside, that admission feels like a perfect summary of the band's penchant for spinning stories of chaos into catchy-as-hell, shout-along songs. With bandmates Nestor Chumak, Zack Mykula and Steve Sladkowski masked to adhere to COVID safety protocol, PUP wastes no time here, immediately setting the tone with "Rot" from the group's aptly-titled 2020 EP, This Place Sucks A**. From there, the set spans the band's discography, spotlighting two cuts ("Kids" and "Scorpion Hill") from 2019's Morbid Stuff and "Reservoir," a track off the group's debut.

And to NPR officemates who think you've escaped an earsplitting in-office set with this (home) concert, let the handmade "Ceci n'est pas une Tiny Desk" ("This is not a Tiny Desk") sign serve as a warning: When the Tiny Desk returns to NPR HQ and the U.S.-Canada border reopens, prepare to have your workday interrupted.

SET LIST
"Rot"
"Kids"
"Reservoir"
"Scorpion Hill"
