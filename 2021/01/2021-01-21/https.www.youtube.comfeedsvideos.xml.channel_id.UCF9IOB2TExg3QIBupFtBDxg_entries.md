Re – WHO

You had the authority, you had the ability to challenge China, 

to question China as to what they were doing, and you needed to do that for global health

You failed to do it

An independent panel

https://theindependentpanel.org

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/independent-pandemic-review-panel-critical-china-who-delays-n1254598

Criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) for not declaring an international emergency until Jan. 30.

Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark

Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf

What is clear to the Panel is that public health measures could have been applied more forcefully by local and national health authorities in China in January

As evidence emerged of human-to-human transmission, in far too many countries, this signal was ignored

Although the term pandemic is neither used nor defined in the International Health Regulations (2005), 

WHO first uses the P word, 11th March

its use does serve to focus attention on the gravity of a health event. 

The panel called for a global reset

Make recommendations in a final report to health ministers from the WHO's 194 member states in May

Supplies temporarily been halted by Pfizer, as they expand their facilities in Belgium
