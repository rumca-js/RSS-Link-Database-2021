The Tiny Desk is teaming up with globalFEST this year for a thrilling virtual music festival: Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST. The online fest includes four nights of concerts featuring 16 bands from all over the world. From Monday, Jan. 11, through Thursday, Jan. 14, we’ll be streaming new performances at 8 p.m. ET on NPR Music’s YouTube channel and NPR.org.
Every January, I attend globalFEST at a New York City nightclub and see some of the most fantastic music I'll experience all year. Now, given the pandemic's challenges and the hardening of international borders, NPR Music and globalFEST is moving from the nightclub to your screen of choice and sharing this festival with the world. Each night, we’ll present four artists in intimate settings (often behind desks donning globes), and it's all hosted by African superstar Angélique Kidjo, who performed at the inaugural edition of globalFEST in 2004.
For our opening night, we have the gospel sounds of the Dedicated Men of Zion, the flamenco and Gypsy jazz-influenced North African sounds of Labess, the award-winning vocalist and songwriter Sofia Rei, who blends Argentine and other South American folk traditions with experimental pop and electronic music, and Tiny Desk alum DakhaBrakha, a Ukranian rock band overflowing with joy and energy. Below you’ll find short descriptions about each act, written by the globalFEST team.

DEDICATED MEN OF ZION
Dedicated Men of Zion come to you from their backyard barbecue in North Carolina, bringing with them an electrified version of sacred Gospel soul music. This family band (all related through blood or marriage) has been isolating together during the pandemic, and the members are excited to play together as an uplifting note during difficult times.

SET LIST
"Father, Guide Me, Teach Me"
"Can't Turn Me Around"
"It's A Shame"

LABESS
When we look at global arts, it's amazing to see how many traditions and nations can come together to make music together. Nowhere is that clearer than the music of Labess, an Algerian and Canadian band that is performing and recording their set from France and Colombia, proving that music has no boundaries even in times of isolation.
"Labess" means "everything is fine" in Arabic, and their flamenco and Gypsy jazz-influenced North African chaabi (folk) music brings that message to life. 

SET LIST
"Yal Maknin"
"Yemma"
"La Vida Es Un Carnaval"

SOFIA REI
Recording from her apartment in Brooklyn, award-winning vocalist and songwriter Sofia Rei provides a concert that blends Argentinian and other South American folk traditions with experimental pop and electronic music. This mix of tradition and modernity is even present in her setting, which blends traditional iconography with robotic 'saints' and exuberantly grown plants with sound boards and looping pedals.

SET LIST
"Un Mismo Cielo" (The Same Sky)
"Negro Sobre Blanco" (Black On White)
"Escarabajo Digital" (Digital Beetle)

DAKHABRAKHA
Recorded from Ukraine, DakhaBrakha returns both to globalFEST and Tiny Desk. Their first globalFEST performance was in 2014, and their time with Tiny Desk in 2015 remains a favorite. We've had them in our spaces, so it's a real treat to see them in theirs, the Dakh Theater in Kyiv, where the band formed and where they've crafted their amazing catalogue of songs. Coming together, their performance maintains the energy and joy that define their music, bouncing off each other musically and emotionally.

SET LIST
"Komora"
"Vynnaya ya"
