Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news. This is a special week as its the start of CES or the consumer electronic show that is being held digitally. I have attended most of the events and so far I have been extremely excited about many of the new technologies for VR that have been announced. New headsets, new headset technologies, haptip force feedback gloves and more. That and so much more this week, so I hope you enjoy!\n\nMy links-\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://youtu.be/Xp-p5RGoGpM\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nJoin my discord for good times\nhttps://discord.gg/thrill\nPatreon link:Join\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\nGAMERSUPPS Discount Code: THRILL\nhttp://gamersupps.gg/?afmc=thrill\n\nMusic-\nProtostar -https://open.spotify.com/track/6kjl9utzXBGxYGP6FuBDPn?si=iK-OGnqMTkaJHw8XnwIPog\n\nSources-\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/pavlov-vr-tanks-ww2-update/\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/lenovo-thinkreality-a3-ar-smart-glasses/\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/difference-between-smartglasses-and-augmented-reality-glasses-why-everyone-is-confused/\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/creal-light-field-ar-vr-headset-prototype/#1610356990004-59843e40-72b1\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/mechanical-display-shifting-sde-reduction-facebook-reality-labs-research/\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/medal-of-honor-update-patch-1-19/\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-quest-2-monthly-active-users/\nhttps://vrscout.com/news/defunctland-vr-disney-ride-back-to-life/\nhttps://vrscout.com/news/defunctland-vr-disney-ride-back-to-life/\nhttps://uploadvr.com/carmack-facebook-login/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIIXyfuxOcU", "date_published": "2021-01-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
