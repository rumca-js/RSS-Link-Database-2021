From the Ballistic Knife to the Crossbow, let's take a look back at Call of Duty's Special Weapons class.

Call of Duty's Special weapons class has always helped mix up a weapon roster. In this video, Richie goes over the top nine weapons that earned the "special" moniker. Everything from Riot Shields to the legendary Crossbow, this list will be familiar to those who have played any Call of Duty game from 2010 onwards. 

Over the years, the special class of weapons usually  refers to equipment like ballistic knives and specialty rocket launchers. While this list has both, there are also strange weapons like Black Ops III's DIY 11 Renovator, which is a tactical nail gun. Launched along the D13 Sector handsaw, the category of weapons has sure take some silly turns. Others are more well known such as the Death Machine mini gun and the War Machine chain gun. While these are fun to use and memorable, our number 1 pick is the iconic Crossbow. 

For more info about this sort of specialty weapon, be sure to check out our video where arms expert John Ferguson discusses them and their impact in weapons history. We've also got more top 10 videos in our Call of Duty playlist. Thanks for watching!
