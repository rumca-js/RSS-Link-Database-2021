In this video we compare Hitman 3 loading times on five different consoles, including the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and the Xbox One S.

Hitman III is here, having launched for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Xbox One, PS4, Switch, Stadia, and PC. That's a lot of options and you may be wondering which version is right for you. Well, if loading times are a big part of your decision-making process, then you've come to the right place.

In the video above, we test the loading times for Hitman III on five different consoles. Apologies if you were considering buying the game for Switch, Stadia, or PC--this is a PlayStation vs. Xbox video.

For PlayStation owners, we compare the loading speeds between the standard PS4 and PS5. Xbox owners can skip ahead to when we put the Xbox One S up against both the Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X. And if you happen to own both of the current gen consoles, we have a PS5 vs. Xbox Series X comparison to round things out. 

The exact time stamps are listed below if you're looking for a specific comparison.

In GameSpot's Hitman III review, Phil Hornshaw writes, "What's good about Hitman--its level design and the creativity, experimentation, and exploration that affords--is great in Hitman 3. It closes out the trilogy by brilliantly playing off everything that came before it, making use of and then subverting expectations, and rewarding players for their willingness to master the complexity of both its individual levels and the series as a whole."

Jake and Rob boot up an Xbox One disc with the 1.0 version of Cyberpunk 2077, and attempt to power through the bugs and jankiness— Can you finish Cyberpunk in it's worst possible condition?

As a role-playing game, there are many ways you can play Cyberpunk 2077. We’re taking that spirit with us for a new video where we try to play Cyberpunk 2077 in the worst way.

To do so, GameSpot’s Jake and Rob  booted up Version 1.0 of the game running on a regular Xbox One. As you are likely aware by now, this is not the ideal way to play Cyberpunk 2077, and this will become painfully obvious once you watch the video with all the bugs and other issues. 

We used an Xbox that hasn’t been connected to the internet and running on a disc to avoid the updates that have since been released.  

In addition to playing on a poor platform for Cyberpunk 2077, Jake and Rob try to make the worst possible character both in terms of looks and behavior. 

There is a lot to enjoy in the video. Sit back and watch Jake and Rob suffer through the experience so you don’t have to!
