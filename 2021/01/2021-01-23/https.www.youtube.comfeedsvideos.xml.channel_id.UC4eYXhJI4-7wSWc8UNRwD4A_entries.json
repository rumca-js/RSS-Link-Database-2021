With a strong backbeat and enough room to move around, Perez's up-tempo energy brings the party and keeps it going. The theme of the night is salsa dura music, which originated in New York in the 1970s and gained acclaim thanks to acts like the Fania All-Stars and Spanish Harlem Orchestra.\n\nSET LIST\n\"The Garden of Love\"\n\"Talk About It\"\n\"The Underdog\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMartha Redbone: vocals, percussion\nAaron Whitby: keys\nMarvin Sewell: guitars\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Martha Redbone\nVideo and Audio: Martha Redbone and Aaron Whitby\nTiny Desk Meets globalFEST\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\nGLOBALFEST TEAM\nCo-Directors: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, and Bill Bragin\n2021 Curators: Shanta Thake, Isabel Soffer, Bill Bragin, and Viviana Benitez\nEvent Producer: Ian Thake\nHost: Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo\nSocial Media Manager: Valerie French\nPublicity: Brendan Gilmartin, Chart Room Media\nLegal Services: Tamizdat\nLegal Services: Duane Morris\nProducer: THE OFFICE performing arts + film\nVideo Production: MODEMA Studios", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S77KlsGlbCI", "date_published": "2021-01-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Elisapie: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "Every January, I attend globalFEST at a New York City nightclub and see some of the most fantastic music I'll experience all year.

Born in Mali to a diplomat father, Traor\u00e9 had a nomadic upbringing that exposed her to a wide variety of international musical influences.
