What\u2019s a quantum of delivery that\u2019s smaller than a car and bike, but greater than your feet? And faster and potentially cheaper than both? Drones. Which has led to one of the next great races in engineering. Here\u2019s everything you need to know - and to profit from - the great drone wars.\n\nImagine a day when with a few taps on your phone, you order a burger. But instead of some pleb delivering it to your door by \u201ccar\u201d, the restaurant places your food on a drone where it flies over to you in a relatively straight line (way faster than driving through traffic). That is the dream of delivery drones. Recently with the FAA\u2019s new ruling, starting early 2021, companies will be able to operate their drones around people and at night with some regulations.\n\nIf you can be the first company to make a viable drone delivery system, not only are you gonna have the fastest delivery, but your company is going to get the most press, the most word of mouth, the most hype. But perhaps most importantly, the first movers to get this tech working are going to have a massive head start to scoop up market share, and cement their throne at the top of the hill.\n\nAmazon already has their Prime Air program where they\u2019re promising small deliveries in 30 minutes or less via their new drone. UPS partnered with CVS and a hospital to target the healthcare industry and have the drone deploy from the top of their delivery trucks to deliver medicine. Alphabet has their own drone startup called Wing. Wing offers them a way to deliver small goods to their local customers exactly when they need it within 6 miles in 6 minutes. Valqari is offering a solution to the last step in the drone delivery process: where the drone is going to land and take off from, and how to secure the packages for the right person.\n\nElectric airplanes haven\u2019t taken off because of one simple limitation - battery capacity. Drones run into a similar problem but to a lesser degree. \n\nNow, the naysayers will always mock new ideas like these as \u201cunrealistic\u201d that \u201cthis could never happen\u201d that \u201cthere are starving children in Africa and you greedy bastards want even faster delivery? Don\u2019t we have a social responsibility to take care of the needy first?\u201d Time will tell. \n\n-----------------------\n\nL'Ind\u00e9cis, sadtoi - Les Mouvements d'Hiver https://chll.to/285a3974 \nSugi.wa - After Dark https://chll.to/40402d37 \nLeavv - Aqueduct https://chll.to/b6aa49a2 \n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
