Created by Morgoth to help defeat the Noldor, the dragons would be some of the most powerful and cunning of all evil beings.  Today, we feature the lives of Glaurung and Ancalagon the Black - the two most famous early dragons, as well as lesser known dragons like Gostir.\n\nGlaurung, the father of dragons, shows his ability not only to destroy with his fire, but to manipulate with his words and bewitch with his gaze.  He even speaks with his master's voice at one point!  Ancalagon, the greatest and most powerful of Morgoth's dragons, would nearly win the War of Wrath for the Dark Lord, before being defeated in one of the most epic battles in Middle-earth History.\n\n*Hit subscribe - and the bell!* \nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
