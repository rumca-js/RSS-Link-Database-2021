This is pretty fascinating as the game already received a PS5 patch last year which let it tap into the extra horsepower of the system. So you might be wondering what a proper PS5 version brings to the table?

In its time we\u2019ve seen it go everywhere from World War II to the final frontier of space. This year, GameSpot\u2019s Richie Bracamonte took the plunge and played every single COD game. In part 1, we watched him begin from 2003\u2019s Call of Duty to 2008\u2019s Call of Duty World At War. This time around, we\u2019ll continue with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 all the way to 2020\u2019s Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.\n\nOriginally based on WWII, the first few COD titles are packed with historical retellings of several battles carried out across all theatres. As the series progressed, the gaming market flooded with dozens of WWII games made by several other developers. The fad that Activision helped to create quickly took a back seat after the introduction of the Modern Warfare series in 2008. After major successes with the revitalized series, Call of Duty remained a household name to this day.\n\nIf you love Call of Duty as much as Richie, GameSpot is the place for you! We\u2019re always covering the latest news including gameplay, breakdowns and more. GameSpot\u2019s YouTube page also has classic COD playlists full of fun weapons videos, chats and more.\n\n#cod #callofduty", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74_zo2pCAiU", "date_published": "2021-08-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Madden NFL 22 Review", "description": "With meaningful additions on and off the field, Madden NFL 22 marks a recent high point for the series, but technical issues get in the way.\n\nMadden 22 is now available on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Box Series X|S and Xbox One, Stadia, and PC.

But how does it compare to the original PS4 version?\n\nA point of contention for some players during the release of Ghost of Tsushima was the lack of lip sync when playing with Japanese audio. Considering the game\u2019s setting and how playing it in Japanese is featured as a selling point when you start the game, this exclusion did hurt those looking to experience the game this way.\n\nThis is because the original PS4 release of Ghost of Tsushima used pre-rendered cutscenes, which were so big, they could barely fit on the game disc. This didn\u2019t leave the space for alternate cutscenes with different lip sync. In the PS5 version, The Director's Cut, the cutscenes rendered are in real-time. This allows room for Sucker Punch to add in Japanese lip sync.\n\nAs someone who played Ghost of Tsushima in Japanese this is by far my favorite new addition, it\u2019s still not perfect in a few spots but it\u2019s a massive improvement. Playing in Japanese, you don\u2019t find yourself distracted by the lip sync the way you might have been previously. Watch this video for yourself to see the differences between the two versions.\n\n#ghostoftsushima", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jszehvdyGEQ", "date_published": "2021-08-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Halo Infinite Development Update (August)", "description": "Join members of the 343 Industries team for a discussion on key takeaways from the recent Multiplayer Technical Preview, updates on Halo Infinite\u2019s overall development, and what to expect at launch.  \n\nSome key updates included campaign co-op and Forge getting delayed to post-launch, with the former tentatively arriving around three months after launch and the latter coming six months after launch.
