I haven't done animation like this in years, and never with this kind of a coherent goal, so approximately 48 seconds of this video consumed 80% of the entire post production time.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nBackground artist: Agata Pankowska\nhttps://twitter.com/AgataPortfolio\n\nCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehuman\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr_rb_pitHk", "date_published": "2021-08-20 18:27:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
