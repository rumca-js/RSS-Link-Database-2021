Ghost Of Tsushima Director’s Cut gives us a native PS5 version, with new upgrades to take advantage of the hardware. But is it enough to make the upgrade?

Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut is now out, bringing a proper next generation version of Sucker Punch’s open world samurai adventure to the PlayStation 5. This is pretty fascinating as the game already received a PS5 patch last year which let it tap into the extra horsepower of the system. So you might be wondering what a proper PS5 version brings to the table? While it’s still largely the same game there’s a number of improvements that make Ghost of Tsushima Director’s cut the definitive version.

The Call of Duty series has been around for almost 20 years. In its time we’ve seen it go everywhere from World War II to the final frontier of space. This year, GameSpot’s Richie Bracamonte took the plunge and played every single COD game. In part 1, we watched him begin from 2003’s Call of Duty to 2008’s Call of Duty World At War. This time around, we’ll continue with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 all the way to 2020’s Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.

Originally based on WWII, the first few COD titles are packed with historical retellings of several battles carried out across all theatres. As the series progressed, the gaming market flooded with dozens of WWII games made by several other developers. The fad that Activision helped to create quickly took a back seat after the introduction of the Modern Warfare series in 2008. After major successes with the revitalized series, Call of Duty remained a household name to this day.

If you love Call of Duty as much as Richie, GameSpot is the place for you! We’re always covering the latest news including gameplay, breakdowns and more. GameSpot’s YouTube page also has classic COD playlists full of fun weapons videos, chats and more.

## Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut | Japanese Lip Sync Comparison
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jszehvdyGEQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jszehvdyGEQ)

The PS5 version of Ghost of Tsushima now features proper Japanese lip sync. But how does it compare to the original PS4 version?

A point of contention for some players during the release of Ghost of Tsushima was the lack of lip sync when playing with Japanese audio. Considering the game’s setting and how playing it in Japanese is featured as a selling point when you start the game, this exclusion did hurt those looking to experience the game this way.

This is because the original PS4 release of Ghost of Tsushima used pre-rendered cutscenes, which were so big, they could barely fit on the game disc. This didn’t leave the space for alternate cutscenes with different lip sync. In the PS5 version, The Director's Cut, the cutscenes rendered are in real-time. This allows room for Sucker Punch to add in Japanese lip sync.

As someone who played Ghost of Tsushima in Japanese this is by far my favorite new addition, it’s still not perfect in a few spots but it’s a massive improvement. Playing in Japanese, you don’t find yourself distracted by the lip sync the way you might have been previously. Watch this video for yourself to see the differences between the two versions.

## Naraka Bladepoint Review

In this video, we go over the GameSpot Review for Naraka Bladepoint which was done by Justing Clark. 

Naraka Bladepoint's sharp new take on the Battle Royale formula gets off to a promising, but slightly awkward start. 

If absolutely nothing else, be grateful to Naraka Bladepoint for being one of a scant few battle royale titles where getting one-shotted by someone hiding in a shrub three football fields away isn't a danger. That by itself makes it welcoming in a way the genre tends to ignore. But lurking beneath that relative ease and approachability is a shrewd game of wuxia-inspired combat that demandsfar more steelfrom its players--and we're not just talking about swords and spears.
