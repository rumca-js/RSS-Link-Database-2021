Still a teenager at the time, Bugg's career took off at an incredible pace; his first full-length debuted at No. 1 in the U.K. album charts, and Bugg subsequently embarked on a U.S. tour, opening for none other than Noel Gallagher. In January of 2014, Bugg returned to The Current to perform before an audience in the Forum at Minnesota Public Radio \u2014 still a month shy of his 20th birthday.
