EA recently announced that its beloved horror game, Dead Space, would be getting its very own remake, which seems like a good idea after Capcomâ€™s success with its Resident Evil 2 Remake. We've also seen other fantastic games like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro see their own graphical overhauls with well crafted remasters.

Whether it be a top-to-bottom re-imagining, like the Final Fantasy VII Remake, or something that simply updates the graphics and controls - many classics deserve this treatment so they can find a new passionate audience. These are Dave's top picks for games that deserve a remake or remaster.
