Eight years ago today — on Aug. 6, 2013 — singer-songwriter Jake Bugg made his first visit to The Current. Still a teenager at the time, Bugg's career took off at an incredible pace; his first full-length debuted at No. 1 in the U.K. album charts, and Bugg subsequently embarked on a U.S. tour, opening for none other than Noel Gallagher. In January of 2014, Bugg returned to The Current to perform before an audience in the Forum at Minnesota Public Radio — still a month shy of his 20th birthday. The performances in this video compilation are from those sessions at The Current in 2013 and 2014.

Flash-forward to today, and Jake Bugg's next album, "Saturday Night, Sunday Morning," is set for release on August 20, 2021.
