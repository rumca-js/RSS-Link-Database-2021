This includes the look and feel of the environments running on the MW engine, as well as what you can expect for campaign, zombies mode, multiplayer. \n\nWith Call of Duty Vanguard officially announced, GameSpot was able to check out a hands-off, digital event with loads of information about this year's Call of Duty title. Unfortunately, GameSpot wasn't able to capture footage or gameplay of the event, so this video will mostly feature captured footage and assets from previous Call of Duty games. \n\nCall of Duty Vanguard will be set in World War II but will not have ties to 2017's \"WWII\" story line. It'll feature a new story surrounding four allied soldiers across the globe, who eventually team up at the tail end of the second World War. The game will run on an updated version of the Modern Warfare engine and will feature new and returning modes and ways to play. A new mode that was discussed was \"Battle Hill\"- a mix of battle royal and gunfight modes. Zombies return with production led by Treyarch studios, and plans for an expansive origin story to Cold War's Zombies mode. Not much was mentioned in regards to multiplayer, but a separate even was announced for another time. Call of Duty Vanguard releases on November 5th 2021.\n\nAs more news surfaces about Call of Duty Vanguard, stick with GameSpot for the latest coverage, including dates for alpha and beta tests, trailers and more. GameSpot will also keep you up to date with the latest information about the ongoing California lawsuit against Activision/Blizzard.\n\n#cod #callofduty #callofdutyvanguard", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThBtYsJh-RQ", "date_published": "2021-08-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty Vanguard Reveal Trailer", "description": "Check out the Call of Duty Vanguard Reveal Trailer unveiled during the in game Warzone event on 8.19.21.\n\n#CallOfDuty #Vanguard #CallOfDutyVanguard", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE9ZqVo1NYc", "date_published": "2021-08-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty Vanguard Reveal in Warzone", "description": "See the first look at the new Call of Duty Vanguard, revealed in a special Warzone event. \n\n#callofduty #vanguard #warzone", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miXd0FUa_Ps", "date_published": "2021-08-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Did Call Of Duty: Vanguard Change Our Minds On WW2?", "description": "Call Of Duty: Vanguard will take players back to World War II when it releases on November 5, packing a whopping 20 maps, a new Warzone location, and the mysterious Champion Hill mode.

Despite the rumors of being rushed, the game will launch with 20 maps, a new Warzone location, and a competitive Champion Hill mode.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we talk over the first Vanguard reveal event, where we saw a campaign mission, components of multiplayer, and some future competitive modes we can\u2019t talk about yet. Richie and Aaron discuss the general community sentiment against a World War II setting and whether their own minds have been changed after this reveal. Some of the important points include the fact that Vanguard appears to channel the spirit of 2019\u2019s \n\nModern Warfare with a huge focus on gunplay, gun modding, ammo conversions, and attachments. Multiplayer will include more destructible environments with lots of bullets tearing up levels and opening up sightlines as matches progress. Vanguard will also run on the Modern Warfare engine, meaning a smooth transition between the main game and Warzone.\u00a0\nCall Of Duty: Vanguard releases on November 5 on all major platforms and will have a reveal in Warzone.
