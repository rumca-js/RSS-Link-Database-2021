In addition to a toxic father figure, \"there's tragedy upon tragedy upon tragedy,\" Mary says. \n\n\"But they seem really cool,\" Mary continues, \"like they got through a lot of this with humor. ... It is so good. You should watch it.\"\n\n\"Family Band: The Cowsills Story\" is available for viewing on Showtime and on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#marylucia #thecowsills #familyband", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw53B67lM4", "date_published": "2021-08-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Michigander - Full #MicroShow Performance for The Current", "description": "Detroit's Michigander made a grand return to the Icehouse stage in Minneapolis for The Current's first #MicroShow in over a year, including songs from his latest release, 'Everything Will Be Ok Eventually'.\n\nSongs Played:\n00:08 Better\n04:54 Misery\n08:20 Reds\n14:37 OK\n18:42 Saturday\n22:55 East Chicago, IN\n31:04 Let Down\n\nThe Current's #MicroShows are produced in partnership with New Belgium Brewing.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqceOXzSe7c", "date_published": "2021-08-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Phoebe Bridgers - three live performances (2018)", "description": "August 17 is the birthday of singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers.
