unvaccinated people\n\n(with the Alpha variant, peak virus levels in those infected post-vaccination were much lower)\n\nTwo doses of either vaccine still provided at least the same level of protection as having had COVID-19 through natural infection\n\nPeople who had been vaccinated after already being infected with COVID-19 had even more protection than vaccinated individuals who had not had COVID-19 before\n\nTwo doses of Pfizer-BioNTech have greater initial effectiveness against new COVID-19 infections\n\nbut this declines faster compared with two doses of
