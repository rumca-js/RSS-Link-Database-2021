New COVID-19 Cases and Hospitalizations Among Adults, by Vaccination Status — New York, May 3–July 25, 2021

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e1.htm?s_cid=mm7034e1_w

New study from New York

First to assess vaccine protection against coronavirus infection in delta times

Data for New York May 3 to July 25

N = 10.5 million

Modest drop in vaccine effectiveness against lab confirmed infection

May 3, 91.7%

July 25, 79.8%

But

Age adjusted effectiveness against hospitalizations

May 3, 91.9% to 95.3%

July 25, 91.9% to 95.3%

Factors

Delta up from 2% to 80%

Widespread relaxations

Implications

Currently authorized vaccines have high effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization, 

but effectiveness against new cases appears to have declined in recent months

these findings support the implementation of a layered approach centered on vaccination, as well as other prevention strategies

Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Nursing Home Residents Before and During Widespread Circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant — National Healthcare Safety Network, March 1–August 1, 2021

N = 85,593 weekly reports

mRNA vaccines

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e3.htm?s_cid=mm7034e3_w

Effectiveness against infection declined in nursing homes as delta increased

March, 75%

June, 53%

Vaccination for visitors and staff is crucial,

additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine might be considered for nursing home and long-term care facility residents

Sustained Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines Against COVID-19 Associated Hospitalizations Among Adults — United States, March–July 2021
N = 1,129 diagnosed patients

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e2.htm?s_cid=mm7034e2_w

Analysis of patients at 21 hospitals

After 2 doses of mRNA vaccine

Across 18 states

Substantial protection against hospitalizations

No decline in protection against hospitalization over 24 weeks

Effectiveness was steady at 86% percent

Immunocompetent adults, 90% protection

Remained constant during delta surge

At 2 to 12 weeks after second dose, 86%

At 13 to 24 weeks after second dose, 84%

CDC director Rochelle Walensky

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/18/covid-vaccine-effectiveness/

Examining numerous cohorts through the end of July and early August, three points are now very clear

First, vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection begins to decrease over time. 

Second, vaccine effectiveness against severe disease, hospitalization and death remains relatively high. 

And third, vaccine effectiveness is generally decreased against the delta variant

Impact of Delta on viral burden and vaccine effectiveness against new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the UK 

https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/covid-19/covid-19-infection-survey/results/new-studies

https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/files/coronavirus/covid-19-infection-survey/finalfinalcombinedve20210816.pdf

N = 384,543

Households, 221,909

Obtaining two vaccine doses remains the most effective way to ensure protection against Delta 

With Delta, Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines still offer good protection against new infections

but effectiveness is reduced compared with Alpha

However, Delta infections after two vaccine doses had similar peak levels of virus to those in unvaccinated people

(with the Alpha variant, peak virus levels in those infected post-vaccination were much lower)

Two doses of either vaccine still provided at least the same level of protection as having had COVID-19 through natural infection

People who had been vaccinated after already being infected with COVID-19 had even more protection than vaccinated individuals who had not had COVID-19 before

Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech have greater initial effectiveness against new COVID-19 infections

but this declines faster compared with two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca

After four to five months, effectiveness of these two vaccines similar

however, long-term effects need to be studied

The time between doses does not affect effectiveness in preventing new infections

Younger people have even more protection from vaccination than older people

UK, third shots

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-58266043

Prof Peter Openshaw

New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG

We can't just look at the antibody levels and think that that equates to levels of protection

It still seems that you get a lot of protection from these vaccines, even if the antibody levels have drifted down to some sort of stable level

## Vaccines, third doses required

Data from Israel Health Ministry

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.21261317v1.full.pdf

N = 2.5 million (16 and over)

Second dose administered within the 21 to 28 day interval set by national guidelines 

A significant drop in protection against hospitalization among people age 65 and older

Who were vaccinated in January and February

Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the dominant strain in Israel in June 2021

Israel is currently experiencing a new surge of cases

The correlation between antibody dynamics and clinical protection remains undefined 

Correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection

We found that the risk for infection was significantly higher for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later

Model 1

We matched 329,177 persons in each group

1,911 cases of breakthrough infection were recorded

1,151 of them in the Early Vaccinees group

760 in the Late Vaccinees group

We found a statistically significant 53% increased risk for breakthrough infection in early vaccines (P less than 0.001)

We found a similar trend across all age groups

Model 2

Individuals who were vaccinated in January 2021

Had a 2.26-fold increased risk for breakthrough infection

Compared to individuals who were vaccinated in April 2021

Israel has already started beginning giving booster shots to people older than 50.

Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England

Effectiveness of Covid-19 Vaccines against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891

After one dose of Pfizer or AZ, delta efficacy = 31%

After one dose of Pfizer or AZ, alpha efficacy = 49%

After two dose of Pfizer, alpha efficacy = 94%

After two dose of Pfizer, delta efficacy = 88%

After two dose of AZ, alpha efficacy = 75%

After two dose of AZ, delta efficacy = 67%

Data from Qatar

BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in Qatar

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.11.21261885v1

Effectiveness against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease due to delta was 89.7%

Both BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) are highly effective in preventing Delta hospitalization and death, but less so in preventing infection

(Moderna may protect against symptomatic infection more than Pfizer)

We could have done a much better job at setting realistic expectations for this vaccine

And I think that’s hurt us. 

Because I think people get disappointed. 

They think the vaccine isn’t working.”

July 29, 35,000 breakthrough infections a week

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky

Statement that 97 % of people hospitalized by the virus are unvaccinated

Data was out of date

CDC said Friday

40 to 44% of patients hospitalized with breakthrough infections have compromised immune systems

Heather Scobie, member of the CDC’s Covid-19 Response Team

Delta has high prevalence in the U.S. and has moderate impact on vaccine effectiveness. 

The vaccines are likely to still provide protection against severe disease

the potential for waning immunity

Canada, Qatar, Israel, England, Scotland

Vaccine effectiveness at preventing infection ranged 40% to 80%

Effectiveness against severe illness, 90% percent for vaccine recipients overall

(Differences in methodology)


Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security

Breakthrough infections were expected

The goal of the vaccines was to make breakthrough infections clinically inconsequential and that’s what they’re doing
