In this special limited series, Emily Graslie and Trace Dominguez join me as we explore the universal rules of life that tie together Earth\u2019s living systems. In episode 4, we look at some surprising ways that species use teamwork in order to survive. Why is one African tree full of ants? Why are there birds nesting in girafe armpits? What surprising guard animal keeps an endangered butterfly larva from becoming wasp food? Welcome to the world of mutualisms and animal partnerships.\n\nIn Our Nature is a special miniseries produced by It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart for PBS.
