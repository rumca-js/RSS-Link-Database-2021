Seemingly distant ecosystems, even half a world apart, are connected in surprising ways. In this special limited series, Emily Graslie and Trace Dominguez join me as we explore the universal rules of life that tie together Earth’s living systems. In episode 4, we look at some surprising ways that species use teamwork in order to survive. Why is one African tree full of ants? Why are there birds nesting in girafe armpits? What surprising guard animal keeps an endangered butterfly larva from becoming wasp food? Welcome to the world of mutualisms and animal partnerships.

In Our Nature is a special miniseries produced by It’s Okay To Be Smart for PBS. Stay tuned for more episodes coming this summer, here on our YouTube channel!
