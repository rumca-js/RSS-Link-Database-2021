Detonation of the associated nuclear weapon occurred 19 seconds after its deployment at 8:30am PDT (1530 UTC) on May 25, 1953, in Area 5 of the Nevada Test Site. The codename Grable was chosen because the letter Grable is phonetic for G, as in \"gun\", since the warhead was a gun-type fission weapon. As a shell, or artillery-fired atomic projectile (AFAP), the device was the first of its kind. The test remains the only nuclear artillery shell ever actually fired in the U.S. nuclear weapons test program.\n\nWikipedia:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upshot-Knothole_Grable\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
