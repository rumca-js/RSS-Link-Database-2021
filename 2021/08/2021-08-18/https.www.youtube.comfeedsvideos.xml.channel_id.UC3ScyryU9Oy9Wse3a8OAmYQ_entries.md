In “Obama’s War”, Correspondent Martin Smith interviews top generals, diplomats and government officials to understand the internal debates over President Obama's grand attempt to combat terrorism at its roots. With the brunt of the work falling on rank-and-file soldiers in the unforgiving landscape of Helmand province, the Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan, FRONTLINE embedded with Echo Company of the 2nd Marines, 8th Battalion. Since the Marines' arrival that July, Helmand had become the most lethal battlefield in Afghanistan. But FRONTLINE found the Marines trying to act as armed diplomats, attempting to build the necessary trust for badly needed economic development.
