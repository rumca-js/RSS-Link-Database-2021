<div id="ff191ad2b6884c5e8b3052e65973f8e7"></div><p>In the last two years, true wireless earbuds have made quite the leap. There’s no doubt the popularity of Apple’s AirPods helped make these headphones a mainstay, but companies’ ability to offer reliable connectivity, great sound and active noise cancellation (ANC) in an increasingly smaller form factor has hastened widespread adoption. You can also get features that used to be reserved for premium models on mid-range devices. Of course, the popularity means that new earbuds are popping up all the time and the list of options is longer than ever. To help, we’ve compiled the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, including noteworthy features for each selection.</p><h2>Best overall: Sony WF-1000XM4</h2><figure><img alt="Sony totally overhauled its true wireless earbuds with a new design, more powerful noise cancellation, improved battery life and more. However, the choice to change to foam tips leads to an awkward fit that could be an issue for some people. The M4 is also more expensive than its predecessor, which wouldn&#x002019;t be a big deal if fit wasn&#x002019;t a concern.

That was true of the WF-1000XM3 in 2019 and the company distanced itself even further from the competition earlier this year with the <a href="https://amzn.to/3menXFt">WF-1000XM4</a>. A smaller design offers a better fit, but Sony still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">packed in the features</a> — from adaptive ANC and wireless charging to 360 and high-res audio support. The company’s app gives you the ability to let the M4s do a lot of the adjustments for you based on activity and location. What’s more, tools like speak-to-chat, although imperfect, are handy when you need to have a quick conversation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I’m not a huge fan of the new foam ear tips, but based on other reviews, I’m in the minority there. Still, it’s easy enough to find alternatives, and those tips shouldn’t deter you from an otherwise excellent set of buds.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3menXFt" id="c8abbc9de21a43ce9d982317744756f3">Buy WF-1000XM4 at Amazon - $278</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Ry6n5a" id="4332eac884b4413cbc04e849eb75bb1c">Buy WF-1000XM4 at Best Buy - $280</a><h2><br />Runner up: Master &amp; Dynamic MW08</h2><figure><img alt="With its latest true wireless earbuds, Master &amp; Dynamic continues to refine its initial design. The company improved its natural, even-tuned trademark sound to create audio quality normally reserved for over-ear headphones. There are some minor gripes, but M&amp;D covers nearly all of the bases for its latest flagship earbuds, which are undoubtedly the company&#x002019;s best yet." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/1e92ed01-8d69-11eb-aff6-b3f166e86e00" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Master &amp; Dynamic typically stands out from other audio brands due its attention to detail when it comes to design. When most companies are using spruced-up plastic, M&amp;D chooses aluminum, ceramic and leather — even for its true wireless earbuds. The leather is reserved for its headphones, but Master &amp; Dynamic still pairs premium elements with a stellar set of features on the <a href="https://fave.co/3771O3j">MW08</a>. 12-hour battery life, improved noise cancellation and excellent sound quality <a href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mw08-review-true-wireless-earbuds-143027692.html">are the highlights</a>, plus the company reduced the overall size of the earbuds for a better fit.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3B8Lgow" id="9689a3a1df464fb690edf07ea703449d">Buy MW08 at Amazon - $349</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3771O3j" id="2a9e4dbedbd54146b37cd0b6242b2145">Buy MW08 at Master and Dynamic - $349</a><h2><br />Best budget: Anker Soundcore Spirit Dot 2</h2><figure><img alt="Anker Soundcore Spirit Dot 2" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/eed45ff0-059e-11ec-bec0-864c3885d5c1" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Sure, there are cheaper options, but for $80, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-spirit-dot-2-spirit-x2-review-183052156.html">it’s hard to beat</a> the <a href="https://amzn.to/2W25KQx">Anker Soundcore Spirit Dot 2</a>. These true wireless earbuds are smaller than a lot of the competition which makes them more comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Anker also delivers ample bass, which means they can handle hip-hop, electronic and other genres better than many budget buds. They’re also IPX7 rated, so they’ll easily double as your new workout partner.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2W25KQx" id="b0328a96a57a4b30b674e72c1a5002ba">Buy Soundcore Spirit Dot 2 at Amazon - $80</a><h2><br />Best for iOS: AirPods Pro</h2><figure><img alt="AirPods Pro" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/bd13d570-cdc0-11ea-bddb-696b5bd00b0a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele / Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s no denying that AirPods are extremely popular among iPhone owners. And there’s a good reason. The earbuds integrate seamlessly with iOS. Plus, the more recent models offer hands-free access to Siri, on top of core features like quick pairing. In addition to active noise cancellation, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2UuZ254">AirPods Pro</a> have one very important thing the “regular” AirPods don’t: comfort. And when you factor in the spatial audio improvements in iOS 14, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">the Pro model</a> is well worth the extra investment at this point.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2UuZ254" id="737ebf3c6f04438ab91f1e26d21a6526">Buy AirPods Pro at Amazon - $250</a><h2><br />Best for Android: Pixel Buds A-Series</h2><figure><img alt="Google Pixel Buds Series A" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3430b8f0-059f-11ec-bff7-9813650266b9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>In 2020, Google debuted redesigned true wireless Pixel Buds. They were a massive improvement over the original model, but they were also far from perfect. Instead of issuing a minor update in 2021, the company took nearly all of the best features and put them in the more affordable <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Gj0r3n">Pixel Buds A-Series</a>. Hands-free access to Google Assistant, handy language translation and actionable notifications will help with tasks and productivity while improved sound quality makes the A-Series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-a-series-review-160054961.html">a better option</a> for music than its predecessor.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Gj0r3n" id="b4b68d52999f4dbe8c917096b69e980b">Buy Pixel Buds A-Series at Best Buy - $100</a><h2><br />Best overall sound quality: Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2</h2><figure><img alt="Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e3f8e000-059f-11ec-b8f3-933156636cba" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Sennheiser made quite the leap from its first true wireless earbuds <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-19-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review.html">to version 2.0</a>. The company figured out the touch controls, extended the battery life and added active noise cancellation. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3k7qSgL">Momentum True Wireless 2</a> is also the best sounding set of true wireless earbuds we’ve tested. As we noted during our review, Sennheiser consistently creates an audio profile that highlights minute details of songs, from the subtle attack of acoustic guitar strumming to the deep sub of synths and drum machines. The company’s trademark tone is warm, pleasant and inviting. The downside is these are pricey at around $300 and you can find better battery life (and wireless charging) elsewhere. In terms of pure audio quality though, this is the clear top pick.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3k7qSgL" id="5a592c895e874481b98d5241b12042af">Buy Momentum True Wireless 2 at Amazon - $300</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjZVmr" id="f074dffe30dd47da88c1c097ebe4ccab">Buy Momentum True Wireless 2 at Best Buy - $300</a><h2><br />Best overall noise cancellation: Bose QuietComfort Earbuds</h2><figure><img alt="Bose QuietComfort Earbuds" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/06dcc280-05a0-11ec-a7ff-e396bbb5eb3a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s no surprise Bose built a set of true wireless earbuds with impressive active noise cancellation. The company has spent years perfecting its QuietComfort technology to block out the world around you. Most of the time, that’s easier said than done with true wireless, but <a href="https://amzn.to/3iYT7P5">Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds</a> stand above the rest in the ANC department. The company allows you to select one of 11 levels of noise cancellation in its app and you can assign three of those to the on-board controls for quick access. It doesn’t match the isolation of its over-ear headphones, but Bose <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-144502194.html">is clearly ahead</a> of the true wireless competition when it comes to blocking unwanted noise.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3iYT7P5" id="f6ab813ce8294b36adca3153e387adc0">Buy QuietComfort Earbuds at Amazon - $279</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/n12EXo" id="e3c2953ae8094437bf80df5bd35aeab1">Buy QuietComfort Earbuds at Best Buy - $279</a><h2><br />Best mid-range: Samsung Galaxy Buds 2</h2><figure><img alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

The company merged its noise-cancelling Galaxy Buds Pro with the more affordable Galaxy Buds+ to create the <a href="https://amzn.to/3yWU545">Galaxy Buds 2</a>. At $150, this true wireless model remains tiny and comfortable with improved audio quality, adjustable ambient sound and wireless charging. That <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">combination of features</a> makes the Galaxy Buds 2 a solid option for the Android faithful that won’t break the bank.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3yWU545" id="ac03b1e0b6cd4abf805ba75fed5aec44">Buy Galaxy Buds 2 at Amazon - $150</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/3PdZJX" id="678b12f52c234351a87373efc7abc5aa">Buy Galaxy Buds 2 at Best Buy - $150</a><h2><br />Honorable mention: Beats Studio Buds</h2><figure><img alt="Beats Studio Buds review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/b66415d0-cd12-11eb-b1f6-d37d378036c8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Beats is no stranger to true wireless earbuds, but until recently, the only option was its over-the-ear hook design that isn’t for everyone.
