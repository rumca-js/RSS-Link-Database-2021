Much of Kilmer's life and career has been captured by Kilmer's own video camera through the course of his career. The film is enriched by incorporating so much of that archival footage.\n\n\"I was impressed with [Kilmer] as a person of someone I knew so little about,\" Mary says, \"and maybe never thought I would be that interested in him \u2014 and yet, it is fascinating. ... It is just filled with surprises. And the depth of which he thinks is, it just amazed me, completely amazed me.\"\n\n\"VAL\" is directed by Ting Poo and Leo Scott.
