Gunner Wright returns in the Dead Space remake as the voice of Isaac Clarke after voicing the character in Dead Space 2 and 3.

30 years ago the Super Nintendo launched to North American audiences, and the SNES quickly became one of the most beloved consoles of all time during an era where it would have to duke it out with the Sega Genesis for dominance. Today, the Super Nintendo is still fondly remembered as one of gaming's greatest systems with beloved franchises like Super Mario, Metroid, and Zelda. To celebrate the anniversary Dave looks back on the 16-bit system that defined video games.

Persia talks about today’s latest gaming news. CD Projekt Red is bringing in Yigsoft, the community modding team behind WolvenKit, to help Cyberpunk 2077 and we got our first look at the cast of Welcome to Raccoon City courtesy of images from IGN. We also get to check out the new Dead Space tomorrow for the first time and the Halo: Master Chief Collection’s next Beta is adding some quality of life improvements for PC players.

In this video, Persia talks about today’s latest gaming news. CD Projekt Red is bringing members of Cyberpunk 2077’s modding community onboard to work on backend Cyberpunk 2077 projects and modding support. The news spread on Twitter after a screenshot of the announcement from the team’s discord was shared online but we’ve yet to hear any official word from CD Projekt Red at this time.

The three images reveal the new actors for the live-action movie: Kaya Scodelario as Claire Redfield, Avan Jogia as Leon Kennedy, Tom Hopper as Albert Wesker, Nathan Dales as Brad Vickers, Hannah John-Kamen as Jill Valentine, and Robbie Amell as Chris Redfield. The images also revealed Marina Mazepa who will be playing Lisa Trevor. Welcome to Raccoon City comes out in theaters on November 24.

EA will reveal more details on Motive Studio's new Dead Space remake as part of a Livestream event tomorrow on Motive Studio’s Twitch channel. The wording here suggests the presentation won't be the type of showcase that could be expected closer to a game's release, which makes sense given the Dead Space remake isn't expected to release until the end of 2022 at the soonest. The stream begins at 10AM PT and you can view it live on youtube.com/gamespot.

Halo: MCC’s File Share, Game Browser, and more are heading to the next Beta for Season 8 and will improve the quality of life for PC Players. File sharing on PC will arrive with everything players should expect and "trust levels," which can be set for other players. 

The custom games browser will cover not only Halo: Reach, but also Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 3. This version of the browser will also come with numerous quality of life improvements, including better search functions, filters, and changes to sub-menus.

When Season 8 for Halo: The Master Chief Collection launches this week, players will also get to play a brand new map for Halo 3. The map, titled Icebox, is a remake of the Halo 2 map Turf.

## We Played 5 Hours Of Far Cry 6

Far Cry 6 releases in October, and we recently played for five hours. Here’s how we felt about the island of Yara and our time with Amigos, Supremos, and Resolver weapons. 

Far Cry 6 attempts to make the island of Yara as much of a character as the brutal dictator ruling over it: Anton Castillo, played by famed actor Giancarlo Esposito. We recently got to play a five-hour hands-on preview of Far Cry 6 and were able to experience a lot of the game’s main systems, including Amigos, Supremos, and Resolver weapons. Our time included gun modding and customization, taking down checkpoints and bases, driving around in tanks, and recruiting a bloodthirsty rooster named Chiccharon.

In this video, we go in-depth on how Far Cry 6 could form its own identity while using familiar Far Cry mechanics, what the new open-world feels like when players can wield Supremos, which are basically super-abilities, and how the game might avoid getting too repetitive. We also managed to get in a few co-op missions and experienced how the game’s gear and level systems play when you have a friend with you. Overall, Far Cry 6 tries to elevate its story above a mere shooting gallery by tapping into the themes of real-world revolutions.

Far Cry 6 releases October 7 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.
