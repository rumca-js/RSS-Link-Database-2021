11.4 - 13.4 fold decrease in the relative risk of confirmed infection\n\n9.5 - 15.5 fold decrease in the relative risk of severe illness\n\nDiscussion \n\nIf waning immunity to Delta is 50% protection against infection at more than 6 months\n\nA booster - vaccinated individual susceptible to infection would decrease to 5% relative to unvaccinated\n\nTherefore vaccine efficacy for booster-vaccinated individuals to 95%\n\n(similar to the original \u201cfresh\u201d vaccine efficacy against the Alpha strain)\n\nOur findings give clear indications of the effectiveness of a booster dose even against the currently dominant Delta variant \n\nUS and UK current thinking\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/groups/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-immunisation\nModerately to severely immunocompromised people", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDx8nRWuC3Q", "date_published": "2021-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Important announcement", "description": "Herd immunity will not come\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/10/delta-variant-renders-herd-immunity-from-covid-mythical\n\nhttps://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/delta-coronavirus-government-liberal-democrat-b950068.html\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/08/10/delta-variant-has-wrecked-hopes-herd-immunity-warn-scientists/\n\nProf Andrew Pollard, Oxford vaccine team\n\nClear that the delta variant can infect people already vaccinated\n\nMaking herd immunity impossible to reach even with high vaccine uptake\n\nAnyone who is still unvaccinated will, at some point, meet the virus. \nWe don't have anything that will stop transmission, \nso I think we are in a situation where herd immunity is not a possibility\nand I suspect the virus will throw up a new variant that is even better at infecting vaccinated individuals\nAngela Merkel\n\nEnding free testing from Oct 11\n\nDepartment of Health\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/covid-19-vaccination-programme\n\nUK vaccination, prevented 60,000 deaths and 66,900 hospitalisations\n\nNever be enough to stop Covid from spreading\n\nWinter wave inevitable\n\nProfessor Paul Hunter, University of East Anglia\nThe concept of herd immunity is unachievable\nbecause we know the infection will spread in unvaccinated populations\nand the latest data is suggesting that two doses is probably only 50 percent protective\nTime to change the way the data is collected and recorded as the virus becomes endemic\nWe need to start moving away from just reporting infections, \nor just reporting positive cases admitted to hospital, \nto actually start reporting the number of people who are ill because of Covid\nOtherwise we are going to be frightening ourselves with very high numbers that actually don't translate into disease burden\nSajid Javid\n\nPreparations to offer Covid booster jabs from next month\nWaiting for the final advice from the JCVI\nOver-50s set to be offered the flu jab at the same time as booster\n\nSir Andrew Pollard\n\nI think as we look at the adult population going forward, \nif we continue to chase community testing and are worried about those results, \nwe're going to end up in a situation where we're constantly boosting \nto try and deal with something which is not manageable\nIt needs to be moving to clinically driven testing\nIf someone is unwell they should be tested, \nbut for their contacts, if they're not unwell then it makes sense for them to be in school and being educated\nDr Ruchi Sinha, consultant paediatrician, Imperial College\nChoosing not to vaccinate children would be unlikely to cause problems in the health service\nWhat matters is the burden of patient hospitalisation\nand actually there hasn't been as much with this delta variant\nThey tend to be the children who have got their comorbidities, obesity, or severe neurological problems\nand those children are already considered for vaccination. \nCovid on its own in paediatrics is not the problem", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhRb5hnTseU", "date_published": "2021-08-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
