We also get to check out the new Dead Space tomorrow for the first time and the Halo: Master Chief Collection\u2019s next Beta is adding some quality of life improvements for PC players.\n\nIn this video, Persia talks about today\u2019s latest gaming news. CD Projekt Red is bringing members of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s modding community onboard to work on backend Cyberpunk 2077 projects and modding support. The news spread on Twitter after a screenshot of the announcement from the team\u2019s discord was shared online but we\u2019ve yet to hear any official word from CD Projekt Red at this time.\n\nThe three images reveal the new actors for the live-action movie: Kaya Scodelario as Claire Redfield, Avan Jogia as Leon Kennedy, Tom Hopper as Albert Wesker, Nathan Dales as Brad Vickers, Hannah John-Kamen as Jill Valentine, and Robbie Amell as Chris Redfield. The images also revealed Marina Mazepa who will be playing Lisa Trevor. Welcome to Raccoon City comes out in theaters on November 24.\n\nEA will reveal more details on Motive Studio's new Dead Space remake as part of a Livestream event tomorrow on Motive Studio\u2019s Twitch channel. The wording here suggests the presentation won't be the type of showcase that could be expected closer to a game's release, which makes sense given the Dead Space remake isn't expected to release until the end of 2022 at the soonest. The stream begins at 10AM PT and you can view it live on youtube.com/gamespot.\n\nHalo: MCC\u2019s File Share, Game Browser, and more are heading to the next Beta for Season 8 and will improve the quality of life for PC Players. File sharing on PC will arrive with everything players should expect and \"trust levels,\" which can be set for other players.\u00a0\n\nThe custom games browser will cover not only Halo: Reach, but also Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 3. This version of the browser will also come with numerous quality of life improvements, including better search functions, filters, and changes to sub-menus.\n\nWhen Season 8 for Halo: The Master Chief Collection launches this week, players will also get to play a brand new map for Halo 3.

Here\u2019s how we felt about the island of Yara and our time with Amigos, Supremos, and Resolver weapons.\u00a0\n\nFar Cry 6 attempts to make the island of Yara as much of a character as the brutal dictator ruling over it: Anton Castillo, played by famed actor Giancarlo Esposito. We recently got to play a five-hour hands-on preview of Far Cry 6 and were able to experience a lot of the game\u2019s main systems, including Amigos, Supremos, and Resolver weapons. Our time included gun modding and customization, taking down checkpoints and bases, driving around in tanks, and recruiting a bloodthirsty rooster named Chiccharon.\n\nIn this video, we go in-depth on how Far Cry 6 could form its own identity while using familiar Far Cry mechanics, what the new open-world feels like when players can wield Supremos, which are basically super-abilities, and how the game might avoid getting too repetitive. We also managed to get in a few co-op missions and experienced how the game\u2019s gear and level systems play when you have a friend with you. Overall, Far Cry 6 tries to elevate its story above a mere shooting gallery by tapping into the themes of real-world revolutions.\n\nFar Cry 6 releases October 7 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.\n\n#farcry6 #farycry6preview", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfwQeAYO-bk", "date_published": "2021-08-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
