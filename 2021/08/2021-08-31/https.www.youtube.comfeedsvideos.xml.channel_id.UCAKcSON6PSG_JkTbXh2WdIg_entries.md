This week, Mary Lucia talks about a must-watch film for any fan of Anthony Bourdain: "Roadrunner: A Film about Anthony Bourdain" from filmmaker Morgan Neville.

"It's heartbreaking," Mary says. "It's going to leave you with a lot of questions."

Overall, Mary says it may just be a film about a man, who, "perhaps was more introverted than he thought, thrust into this lifestyle."

"Roadrunner" is available for streaming on Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Vudu, YouTube and Google Play.

Watch more of what Mary has to say in the video above.
