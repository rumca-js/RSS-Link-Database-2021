Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | Sep. 1, 2021\nGathered in their kitchen are sisters, Emily, Jessica, and Camilla Staveley-Taylor; best known as The Staves. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a tiny desk; we\u2019ve got our kitchen table.\u201d But where The Staves gathered, along with guitarist and tenor horn player Marcus Hamblett, is deeply embedded in their family history. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to you from Watford, England, in the house we grew up in and the table where we wrote most of our songs around. And we would road test every song in this kitchen, so we thought we\u2019d play some songs for you from here.\u201d\n\nThe four songs in this home concert all come from Good Woman, their first album in six years. It was produced with John Congleton (who\u2019s previously worked with an ocean of artists, from St. Vincent to Nelly Furtado) and written after the passing of their mom and the birth of Emily\u2019s first child. This stripped-down performance is a beautiful way to experience these sisters\u2019 gorgeous harmonies through their songs of strength, loss, life and womanhood.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Nothing's Gonna Happen\"\n\"Good Woman\"\n\"Satisfied\"\n\"Waiting on Me to Change\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJessica Staveley-Taylor: vocal, guitar, keys\nCamilla Staveley-Taylor: vocal, guitar\nEmily Staveley-Taylor: vocal\nMarcus Hamblett: guitar, tenor horn\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: SJ Film\nAudio: Iain Graham\nAudio Mix: Josh Rogosin\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nTiny Production Team: Bobby Carter, Maia Stern, Gabrielle Pierre\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #thestaves #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCwDzyLidAw", "date_published": "2021-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Little Simz: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

Her stock as an actress has risen thanks to her role on the Drake-pushed reboot of Top Boy on Netflix; her 2019 album, Grey Area, made plenty of best-of-the-year lists, and the London native received the prestigious Pioneer Award at last year's AIM Awards.\n\nFor her Tiny Desk home concert Simz beamed to us from a more modest setting than all of that might imply: a living room, dropped inside a void. But it's an appropriate space for Simz to introduce her self-searching new album, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. That arc is pulled together here by a proficient group of players interpreting the relaxed sound of producer Inflo (who is on a run like few in the game at the moment \u2013 see Sault and Cleo Sol.) They open with the pulsing military drum and grandiose keys of the record's title track, closing with the bounce and sway of \"Woman,\" dedicated to her mom. Between, a brutally honest message for her father, \"I Love You, I Hate You,\" and a premiere of the Afrobeat bop \"Point and Kill,\" featuring fellow London-based artist Obongjayar.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Introvert\"\n\"I Love You, I Hate You\"\n\"Point and Kill\" (featuring Obongjayar)\n\"Woman\"\nMUSICIANS\n\nLittle Simz: vocals\nKadeem 'Kadz Keyz' Clarke: keys\nOsiris 'OTG' Wilson: vocals, percussion, DJ\nEmanuel J Burton: drums\nKenan Shepherd: bass\nChrio Blake: guitar\nObongjayar: vocals\nOlivia 'Livi Lovez' Williams: vocals\nLadonna Young: vocals\nRachael 'Chella Mac' Mckenzie: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Jeremy Cole, Neicee Oakley, Untold Studios\nAudio: Claudio Cueni\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Andy Huether\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Josh Rogosin, Gabrielle Pierre\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #littlesimz", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkt93coQzqg", "date_published": "2021-08-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
