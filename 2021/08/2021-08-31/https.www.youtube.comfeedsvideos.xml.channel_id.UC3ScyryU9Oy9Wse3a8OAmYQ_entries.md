FRONTLINE tells the stories of soldiers who have come home haunted by their experiences during the Iraq War and asks whether the government is doing enough to help. (Aired 2005)

The military teaches soldiers how to fight, how to kill, how to survive. But who teaches them how to live with themselves? In the 2005 documentary, “The Soldier’s Heart,” FRONTLINE examines the underreported story of the Iraq war: the psychological cost for those who fought it. For those who survived the fighting, the battle is not over. For some, the return home can be as painful as war itself.
