I've had about a week with the brand new book "The Nature of Middle-earth", containing writings of J.R.R. Tolkien and edited by Carl F. Hostetter.  In this review, I'll give my first impressions, the kinds of fans I believe will benefit from this book, and drop a few new findings from the newly unearthed writings of our favorite author!
