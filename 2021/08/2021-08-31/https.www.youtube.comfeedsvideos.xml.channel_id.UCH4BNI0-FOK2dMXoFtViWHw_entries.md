Seemingly distant ecosystems, even half a world apart, are connected in surprising ways. In this special limited series, Emily Graslie and Trace Dominguez join me as we explore the universal rules of life that tie together Earth’s living systems. In episode 5, we meet some interesting bugs that use truly extreme senses to navigate their world. How do dung beetles use astronomy to roll their poo balls home? And what does a swarm of beetles descending on a packed football stadium have to do with forest fires? Welcome to the world of extreme animal senses.
