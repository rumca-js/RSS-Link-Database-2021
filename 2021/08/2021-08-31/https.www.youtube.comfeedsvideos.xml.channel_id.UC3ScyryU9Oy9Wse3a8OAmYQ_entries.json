In the 2005 documentary, \u201cThe Soldier\u2019s Heart,\u201d FRONTLINE examines the underreported story of the Iraq war: the psychological cost for those who fought it. For those who survived the fighting, the battle is not over. For some, the return home can be as painful as war itself. \n\nLove FRONTLINE?
