Eight high speed torpedo boats and their crew visit Edwardian Manchester. The two Barton bridges over the Manchester Ship Canal open for the flotilla to pass through - these are swing bridges, one for a road, the other the only swing aqueduct in Britain carrying a canal. The torpedo boats exude raw power as they pass, observed by two camera crews, one on either side of the canal.
