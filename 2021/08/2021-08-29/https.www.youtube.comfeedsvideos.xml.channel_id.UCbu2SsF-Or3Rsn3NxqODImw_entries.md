From Combat Evolved to Halo Infinite PvP, the pistol has changed many times over the years. In this video, we look at the evolution of the iconic Magnum throughout every Halo game in the series.

In this video, Persia takes a trip through memory lane by revisiting every Halo to take a closer look at how the Magnum has evolved throughout the last two decades in PvP. From Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo Infinite, the Magnum goes through quite the rollercoaster of changes and tweaks. After the Halo Infinite Technical Preview, there is a little more insight on where the newest iteration of the Magnum is heading and how it stands against its predecessors.

Persia also talks about other various factors like the scopeless days of the Magnum in Halo 2 and Halo 3 courtesy of dual-wielding and even how other mechanics in titles such as Halo 4's removal of the descope hindered the Magnum's overall performance. It can be interesting to see how the Magnum had to adjust to every new idea introduced to the series with each new title.

Halo Infinite releases is set to release during the 2021 Holiday Season but you can play future technical previews by signing up for the Halo Insider program on HaloWaypoint.com
