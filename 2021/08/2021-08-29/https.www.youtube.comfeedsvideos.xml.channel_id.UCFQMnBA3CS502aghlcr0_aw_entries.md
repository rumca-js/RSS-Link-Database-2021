BitClout (noun), definition - When you light VC money on fire.

BitClout bills itself as an open source cryptocurrency project and social media platform where users can buy and sell "creator coins" based on people's reputations; these creator coins are non-fungible tokens and are bound to cryptographically secured accounts with unique names. (WIKIPEDIA)

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
