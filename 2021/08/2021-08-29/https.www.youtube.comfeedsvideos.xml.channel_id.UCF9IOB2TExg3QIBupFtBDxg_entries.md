One teacher, not vaccinated, feeling fatigued with some nasal congestion

Worked on, toot of mask for class reading

6 symptomatic, 6 asymptomatic

Mostly in the two rows closest to her desk

everyone lets their guard down â€” but the thing is delta takes advantage of slippage from any kind of protective measures

Children under 12, ineligible for vaccines

COVID-19 Projections for K12 Schools in Fall 2021: Significant Transmission without Interventions

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.10.21261726v1

Without testing and masking R0 = 4.0

More than 75% of susceptible students get infected within three
months in all settings

With masks, R0 = 2.0

The proportion infected drops to approximately 50%

Testing further drops infections

High, 22%

Mid, 16%

Low, 13%

Conclusion

Without interventions in place, the vast majority of susceptible students will become infected through the semester. 

Universal masking can reduce student infections by 26-78%, and biweekly testing along with masking reduces infections by another 50%. 

To prevent new infections in the community, limit school absences, and maintain in-person learning, interventions such as masking and testing must be implemented widely, especially among elementary school settings in which children are not yet eligible for the vaccine.
