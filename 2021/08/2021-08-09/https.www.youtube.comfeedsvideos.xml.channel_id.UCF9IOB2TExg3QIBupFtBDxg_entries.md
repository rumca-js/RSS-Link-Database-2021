 In children

7.1 million fully vaccinated, 12 to 17s 

representing 39 % of 16- to 17-year-olds

and 27 % of 12 to 15s

Cases + 22,903 (a pandemic high)

179 pediatric patients

Governor, no mandates in the state of Florida

(Arizona, Texas)

CDC, 27th July, everyone should wear masks in schools

Any school superintendent that mandates masks risks losing their salary

Paediatricians disagree

Dr Aileen Marty, Florida International University

our children's hospitals are completely overwhelmed

Our pediatricians, the nursing staff, are exhausted, and the children are suffering

It is absolutely devastating

Our children are very much affected

We've never seen numbers like this before

Pfizer and Moderna, vaccines for 5 – 11 years olds by end on the year

US

Children in hospital, 1,450

400 child deaths from covid so far, (34 to 200 die from seasonal flu each year)

Last 7 days, 94,000 child cases last week

Dr Mark Kline, Children's Hospital New Orleans

I've never seen anything like it

We are seeing children fall ill that we just simply didn't see in the first year of the pandemic, before the delta variant came along

Child admissions, zero to 20 in two weeks

Illness duration in children of at least 28 days

77 (4·4%) children

59 (5·1%) older children

18 (3·1%) of 588 younger children

Commonest symptoms, first 4 weeks of illness

Fatigue 84·4%

Headache 77·9%

Anosmia 77·9%

Symptoms for at least 56 in children

Hospitalisations in under 18s, 278 per week

Alasdair Munro, paediatric registrar, University Hospital Southampton

We are extremely busy in the children’s emergency department with Respiratory Syncytial Virus and norovirus among other things, but are still seeing very few cases of Covid-19

Sperm Parameters Before and After COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781360

https://www.dw.com/en/covid-vaccine-the-unfounded-tale-of-infertility/a-58753946

Reproductive toxicity was not evaluated in the clinical trials

SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with decreases in sperm parameters

We assessed sperm parameters before and after mRNA vaccine administration

Volunteers aged 18 to 50 years, n = 45

Scheduled for mRNA COVID-19 vaccination

Participants provided a semen sample after 2 to 7 days of abstinence
prior to receiving the first vaccine dose

Then median 75 days after the second

Semen analyses semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, and total motile sperm count

Results

December 17, 2020 to January 12, 2021

Of the 45 men

21 (46.7%) received BNT162b2 (Pfizer)

24 (53.3%) mRNA-1273 (Moderna)

Baseline

Median sperm concentration, 26 million per ml

Total motile sperm count, 36 million

After second vaccine dose

Median sperm concentration, 39 million per ml

Total motile sperm count, 44 million

Semen volume and sperm motility also significantly increased

Eight of the 45 men were oligospermic before the vaccine

Of these 8, 7 men had increased sperm concentration to normozoospermic

Men with oligospermia did not experience further decline

No man became azoospermic after the vaccine

Discussion

No significant decreases in any sperm parameter among small cohort of healthy men

Vaccines contain mRNA and not the live virus, unlikely that the vaccine would affect sperm parameters

Reasons for the increases

Magnitude of change is within normal individual variation

May be influenced by regression to the mean

Increased abstinence time before the second sample. 

Study’s time frame encompasses the full life cycle of sperm
