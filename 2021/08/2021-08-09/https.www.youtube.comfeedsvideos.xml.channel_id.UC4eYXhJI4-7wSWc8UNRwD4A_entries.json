Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nStephen Thompson | Aug, 10, 2021\nFlock of Dimes\u00a0may be a \"solo\" project for\u00a0Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner, but she couldn't pass up an opportunity to invite a few friends over. You'll spot their familiar faces all over this video:\u00a0Mountain Man's Amelia Randall Meath,\u00a0Molly Sarl\u00e9\u00a0and\u00a0Alexandra Sauser-Monnig, percussionist Matthew McCaughan from\u00a0Bon Iver... you even get full attendance from\u00a0Sylvan Esso, given that Meath is seated alongside her partner Nick Sanborn. (He doesn't play in the set, but he did co-produce Flock of Dimes' latest album, so Wasner asked him to sit in and bring a book to read.)\n\nThe result is a communal set \u2014 filmed at Sylvan Esso's new studio in Durham, N.C., called Betty's \u2014 that doesn't merely re-create three of the songs from this year's\u00a0Head of Roses. These acoustic performances actually shed new light, thanks to radiant and radically different arrangements, while fully capturing the warmth we look for from Tiny Desk concerts. (Plus, with nine people in the frame, it's a cast large enough that when they clap between songs, they almost sound like a crowd.)\n\nSET LIST\n* \"Two\"\n* \"Price Of Blue\"\n* \"Awake For The Sunrise\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n* Jenn Wasner: vocals, guitar (Flock of Dimes)\n* Amelia Randall Meath: backing vocals (Mountain Man, Sylvan Esso)\n* Alexandra Sauser-Monnig: backing vocals (Mountain Man, Daughter of Swords)\n* Molly Sarl\u00e9: backing vocals (Mountain Man)\n* Joe Westerland: percussion (Megafaun)\n* Matthew McCaughan: percussion (Bon Iver)\n* Alan Good Parker: guitar (Natalie Prass, Matthew E.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | August 9, 2021\nHaving spent time with\u00a0Collections from the Whiteout,\u00a0Ben Howard's\u00a0sonically adventurous fourth album, I was curious to see how he would adapt these songs to the Tiny Desk (home) concert format. So when the opening shot shows Ben in a room alone, an acoustic guitar in hand, it was both an \"oh yeah!\" and an \"uh-oh\" moment. Gone were all those textures that he, Aaron Dessner, and a load of talented musicians had worked on, but front and center was that delicate, reflective voice that I love. It's a voice that, in the recent past, was often swarming in effects and buried in reverb.\n\nSo as Ben Howard opens his Tiny Desk with the album's opening track, I found myself zeroing in on the oblique and painterly images of \"Follies Fixtures\": \"Walk with me to the burning spire. / We can count the d\u0435ad on Ender's pyre. / The dusty towns wh\u0435re the number's found / Don't quite match the missing.\" He later premieres a new tune, \"Oldest Trick In The Book.\"\n\n\"Thanks for having me and allowing me to play the slight variations of songs that I'm forced to settle with at the moment,\" Ben says, and with that he kicks on the drum machine and plays the music that drew me to his work in 2021. Watch those fingers on the guitar and hear that tone. \"Far Out,\" indeed.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Follies Fixture\"\n \u2022 \"Far Out\"\n \u2022 \"I Forget Where We Were\"\n \u2022 \"Oldest Trick In The Book\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Ben Howard: vocals, guitar, drum machine\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Allan Wilson\n \u2022 Audio: Richard Thomas, Josh Rogosin\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Bob Boilen\n \u2022 Video Producer: Kara Frame\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Maia Stern, Gabrielle Pierre, Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #benhoward", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VHlrsZbgBI", "date_published": "2021-08-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
