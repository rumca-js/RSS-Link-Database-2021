toxicity was not evaluated in the clinical trials\n\nSARS-CoV-2 has been associated with decreases in sperm parameters\n\nWe assessed sperm parameters before and after mRNA vaccine administration\n\nVolunteers aged 18 to 50 years, n = 45\n\nScheduled for mRNA COVID-19 vaccination\n\nParticipants provided a semen sample after 2 to 7 days of abstinence\nprior to receiving the first vaccine dose\n\nThen median 75 days after the second\n\nSemen analyses semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, and total motile sperm count\n\nResults\n\nDecember 17, 2020 to January 12, 2021\n\nOf the 45 men\n\n21 (46.7%) received BNT162b2 (Pfizer)\n\n24 (53.3%) mRNA-1273 (Moderna)\n\nBaseline\n\nMedian sperm concentration, 26 million per ml\n\nTotal motile sperm count, 36 million\n\nAfter second vaccine dose\n\nMedian sperm concentration, 39 million per ml\n\nTotal motile sperm count, 44 million\n\nSemen volume and sperm motility also significantly increased\n\nEight of the 45 men were oligospermic before the vaccine\n\nOf these 8, 7 men had increased sperm concentration to normozoospermic\n\nMen with oligospermia did not experience further decline\n\nNo man became azoospermic after the vaccine\n\nDiscussion\n\nNo significant decreases in any sperm parameter among small cohort of healthy men\n\nVaccines contain mRNA and not the live virus, unlikely that the vaccine would affect sperm parameters\n\nReasons for the increases\n\nMagnitude of change is within normal individual variation\n\nMay be influenced by regression to the mean\n\nIncreased abstinence time before the second sample. \n\nStudy\u2019s time frame encompasses the full life cycle of sperm\n\nhttps://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,21994,420,873.html", "link":
