As the U.S. withdraws from Afghanistan and the Taliban seizes control of the country, an excerpt from FRONTLINE’s upcoming film “America After 9/11” reveals how the roots of defeat go back two decades.

The night of the September 11, 2001, attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, then-President George W. Bush addressed the United States. He said, “Today, our nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature.”

Within the U.S. government, a plan took shape to go after the figure behind the attacks: Al Qaeda’s leader Osama bin Laden. He was operating out of Afghanistan, harbored by the extremists running the country — the Taliban.

A small CIA strike force arrived in Afghanistan two weeks after the 9/11 attacks and used money to buy the cooperation of the Taliban’s enemies, rival militias and warlords. American aerial bombardments allowed Afghan fighters to push the Taliban out of the country’s capital, Kabul. But bin Laden, the CIA’s primary target, disappeared.

The post-9/11 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan would embroil the United States in what would become the longest war in American history.

Premiering on PBS and online Tuesday, Sept. 7, 2021, "America After 9/11" traces the U.S. response to the terrorist attacks and devastating consequences across three presidencies.

From the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to the January 6th insurrection, “America After 9/11” exposes the legacy of September 11 – and the ongoing challenge it poses for the president and the country.

Watch "America After 9/11" in full starting Sept. 7, 2021.

As Afghanistan falls to the Taliban, FRONTLINE’S upcoming documentary “America After 9/11” shows how hopes for victory had been abandoned as far back as the Obama administration.

President Barack Obama was focused on ending in the war in Afghanistan. He brought in a general who said a surge of tens of thousands of U.S. troops was necessary to turn the war around.

The general designed a test case: 15,000 troops would try to rout the resurgent Taliban from their stronghold in Marjah. American forces couldn’t hold the territory. They faced ambushes and roadside bombs from the Taliban. The general who recommended the surge called the conflict a “bleeding ulcer.”

With Marjah, once again an American president was being forced to concede. There would be no easy victory in Afghanistan.

When the Twin Towers fell on September 11, 2001, among the thousands killed was the one man who may have known more about Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda than any other person in America: John O'Neill.

This 2002 FRONTLINE documentary chronicles John O'Neill's struggle to convince the FBI to pay attention to the threat posed by Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. The former head of the FBI's flagship antiterrorism unit in New York City, O'Neill had investigated the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa and the USS Cole in Yemen. For five years, he led the fight to track down and prosecute Al Qaeda operatives throughout the world. But he was a controversial figure inside the buttoned-down world of the FBI. O'Neill's critics contend that his personal failings proved fatal to his FBI career. His supporters, however, believe his main failing was refusing to conform to the standard-issue FBI mold.
