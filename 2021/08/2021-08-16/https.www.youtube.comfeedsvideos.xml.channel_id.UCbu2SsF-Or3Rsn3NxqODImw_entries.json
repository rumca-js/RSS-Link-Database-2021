From Tetris Effect to Doom Eternal, many video games are particularly good at getting players into a Flow state, so could understanding Flow be the key to feeling as happy as possible from playing games? \n\nWhether it's Tetris Effect, Super Monkey Ball or Doom Eternal, many different video games give players the feeling of being 'in the zone' while playing or, as psychologists call it, Flow.\n\nFlow is a psychological state that gives people a sense of energized focus, and is familiar to many people who play video games. According to some psychologists, people with more 'Flow' in their lives will live happier lives because of it, so can video games that put people into a state of Flow help players lead happier lives? \n\nAlexander Kriss, psychotherapist and author of 'The Gaming Mind', helps explain why Flow could be the secret to happiness, why some games might be better than others for inducing Flow, and the potential psychological benefits of getting in the zone while playing games.\n\nCheck out another video featuring Alexander, on the Dark Souls series and mental health: https://youtu.be/4dXjBhPB4t0\n\nThe Gaming Mind by Alexander Kriss: https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Mind-Psychology-Videogames-Power/dp/1615196811?tag=gs-buybutton-20\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi: Flow, the secret to happiness: https://youtu.be/fXIeFJCqsPs\nFinding Flow: The Psychology Of Engagement With Everyday Life by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Flow-Psychology-Engagement-Everyday-ebook/dp/B0010NY7OQ\nFlow in games by Jenova Chen: http://jenovachen.info/abstract\nDesigning DOOM Eternal with Hugo Martin - Noclip Podcast #22: https://youtu.be/qBHIalb01ew\nReality Is Broken by Jane McGonigal: https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Broken-Games-Better-Change-ebook/dp/B004G8Q1Q4\n\n#flow", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iMMIJYX2m4", "date_published": "2021-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty Vanguard Official Teaser Trailer", "description": "Get a glimpse of a tease for Call of Duty's next game Vanguard.\n\n#cod #callofduty #vanguard", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uICew7PKTgA", "date_published": "2021-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Marvel's Avengers: War Table for Wakanda Gameplay Breakdown", "description": "Learn more about the upcoming Marvel's Avenger: War for Wakanda expansion in this latest War Table.
