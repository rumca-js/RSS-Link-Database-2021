Can the vaccinated develop long Covid? and Babies and toddlers, infectivity risk?
Most data collected so far in the unvaccinated, 10% +

Israeli health care workers

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109072

Among 1,497 vaccinated health care workers

(Alpha variant times)

39 (2.6%) developed breakthrough infections

All infected after contact with an unvaccinated person

Most breakthrough, mild or asymptomatic

Seven out of 36 workers (19%), still had persistent symptoms at 6 weeks

Seven out of 1,497 is 1 in 213 HCWs

Babies and toddlers, infectivity risk?

Public Health Ontario, based on positive tests, June 1 to December 31, 2020

N = 6,280 households, household index case under 18

Less likely to bring the coronavirus into the home than teenagers

Once infected more likely to spread to others

Adjusted odds of household transmission by children aged 0 to 3 years was 1.43 

Compared with children aged 14 to 17 years

Require lots of hands-on care and cannot be isolated when sick

(Behavioural spread rather than biological)

Zoe Hyde, epidemiologist, University of Western Australia

This study showed that even the youngest of children readily transmit the virus

The key takeaway for me is that it clearly shows that there’s transmission from children occurring in the household

This means we urgently need to think about how we’re going to protect schools when they reopen shortly

Early observations distorted by few social contacts during that time

Rules on self-isolation have changed

England and Northern Ireland

People who are fully vaccinated, or are under 18

No longer have to self-isolate, if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive

Will be advised to take a PCR test

Will not have to self-isolate while they wait for result

People who test positive, legally required to self-isolate for 10 days

Professor Stephen Reicher, Government’s Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours

Government is taking a big risk

Concerned as infections and hospitalisations both high

Vital people take a PCR test if they have come into contact with a positive Covid case

The problem is that if you now make it a choice to people as to whether to take a test...people aren't going to take that test if they can't afford to be positive

Should remain "very cautious" and limit interactions, particularly with vulnerable people

Gov. Cuomo of New York

All health care workers, staff at all hospitals, nursing homes, adult care, other congregate care settings

Must have one dose of vaccine by September 27

Prevent a danger to the health of the people (Delta variant)

Exceptions for religious or medical reasons

Fully vaccinated so far

Hospital workers, 75 % of 450,000 

Adult care facility workers, 74 % 30,000 

Nursing home workers, 68 % of 145,500

Unlike state workers, no test out option

(More than 1,700 people are hospitalized in New York State)

California and Washington State already required

Also

NYC soon museum staff and visitors, 33 venues

Mayor Bill de Blasio Monday

Defeating the Delta variant is the best way to support cultural institutions, because it brings us all back

to include bars, gyms, theaters, and other indoor venues

Take effect Tuesday, enforced from September 13

Texas Supreme Court

Permitted the mask mandate ban by Gov. Greg Abbott to stand

Hospitalizations in Texas, x 4 in the past month

About 14,000 new cases daily

Australia

Hundreds of soldiers patrolled the streets of Sydney

Victoria, curfew of 9 p.m. to 5 a.m

Darwin, 72-hour lockdown after a single asymptomatic infection

Sydney into rural New South Wales

First nation groups

Government priority group for vaccination

Over 16s, 15% vaccinated (versus 26%)

Risk factors and lack of health care facilities in the bush

Western New South Wales, 98 cases, mostly among Indigenous people

Dharriwaa Elders Group

Many of our elders and others in Walgett experience health and social issues that make them vulnerable to contracting Covid-19

The impact on our community could be devastating
