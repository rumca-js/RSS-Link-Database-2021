From Tetris Effect to Doom Eternal, many video games are particularly good at getting players into a Flow state, so could understanding Flow be the key to feeling as happy as possible from playing games? \n\nWhether it's Tetris Effect, Super Monkey Ball or Doom Eternal, many different video games give players the feeling of being 'in the zone' while playing or, as psychologists call it, Flow.\n\nFlow is a psychological state that gives people a sense of energized focus, and is familiar to many people who play video games. According to some psychologists, people with more 'Flow' in their lives will live happier lives because of it, so can video games that put people into a state of Flow help players lead happier lives? \n\nAlexander Kriss, psychotherapist and author of 'The Gaming Mind', helps explain why Flow could be the secret to happiness, why some games might be better than others for inducing Flow, and the potential psychological benefits of getting in the zone while playing games.\n\nCheck out another video featuring Alexander, on the Dark Souls series and mental health: https://youtu.be/4dXjBhPB4t0\n\nThe Gaming Mind by Alexander Kriss: https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Mind-Psychology-Videogames-Power/dp/1615196811?tag=gs-buybutton-20\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi: Flow, the secret to happiness: https://youtu.be/fXIeFJCqsPs\nFinding Flow: The Psychology Of Engagement With Everyday Life by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Flow-Psychology-Engagement-Everyday-ebook/dp/B0010NY7OQ\nFlow in games by Jenova Chen: http://jenovachen.info/abstract\nDesigning DOOM Eternal with Hugo Martin - Noclip Podcast #22: https://youtu.be/qBHIalb01ew\nReality Is Broken by Jane McGonigal: https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Broken-Games-Better-Change-ebook/dp/B004G8Q1Q4\n\n#flow", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iMMIJYX2m4", "date_published": "2021-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty Vanguard Official Teaser Trailer", "description": "Get a glimpse of a tease for Call of Duty's next game Vanguard.\n\n#cod #callofduty #vanguard", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uICew7PKTgA", "date_published": "2021-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Marvel's Avengers: War Table for Wakanda Gameplay Breakdown", "description": "Learn more about the upcoming Marvel's Avenger: War for Wakanda expansion in this latest War Table.

Let\u2019s look at exactly why many of you feel Battlefield 3 was the best Battlefield.\n\nBattlefield 3 is considered by many to be the peak of the Battlefield series. Battlefield 3 came out in 2011, a year after Bad Company 2, and smartly combined the meandering Rush-focused maps of that game with the wide-open Conquest expanses of Battlefield 2. It was both a love letter to the series as well as a compromise between these two audiences and it largely worked. For many fans of Battlefield 3, the series declined after that point by adding too many weapons and gadgets, watering down the class system, reducing destruction, and going back to previous time periods.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we are going to look at what exactly made Battlefield 3 so good, including memorable maps with a strong sense of identity, just enough guns, well-balanced classes, visual leaps in technology, destruction, DLC, campaign, co-op, and more. Battlefield 3 had strong post-launch content with some of the strongest Battlefield maps of all time like Wake Island in the Karkand DLC, a post-apocalyptic Aftermath DLC with Scavenger mode, and some of the biggest maps in the series including Bandar Desert from Armored Kill.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield is finally returning to more modern times with 2042 and fans are very excited to see what influences it draws from the series. Six remastered maps are now confirmed to be in the game in the newly announced Portal creative mode. Battlefield 2042 betas are expected this September with a full release on October 15 for some preorder editions and a general release on October 22.\n\n#battlefield3 #battlefield", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccs3z7IV27w", "date_published": "2021-08-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
