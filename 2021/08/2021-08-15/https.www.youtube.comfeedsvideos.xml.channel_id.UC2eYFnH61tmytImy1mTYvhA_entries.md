Lincucks on sewerslide watch.

I'm talking out loud here about my basic first impressions with installing and running basic commands on OpenBSD. I don't like the idea of the installer, but it worked well. Some familiar commands on GNU/Linux are lacking on BSD. Installing programs is pretty easy, but it'll probably be an issue to rebuild a familiar setup on OpenBSD. No ttys in the way I'm familiar with them and a bunch of little differences.
