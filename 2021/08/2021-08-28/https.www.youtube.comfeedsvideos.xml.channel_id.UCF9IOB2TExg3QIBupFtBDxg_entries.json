Interventions\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.10.21261726v1\n\nWithout testing and masking R0 = 4.0\n\nMore than 75% of susceptible students get infected within three\nmonths in all settings\n\nWith masks, R0 = 2.0\n\nThe proportion infected drops to approximately 50%\n\nTesting further drops infections\n\nHigh, 22%\n\nMid, 16%\n\nLow, 13%\n\nConclusion\n\nWithout interventions in place, the vast majority of susceptible students will become infected through the semester. \n\nUniversal masking can reduce student infections by 26-78%, and biweekly testing along with masking reduces infections by another 50%. \n\nTo prevent new infections in the community, limit school absences, and maintain in-person learning, interventions such as masking and testing must be implemented widely, especially among elementary school settings in which children are not yet eligible for the vaccine.\n\nCanada\n\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html\n\n\nNZ\n\nhttps://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/covid-19-current-cases\n\n\n

with the alpha variant. \n\nResults suggest that outbreaks of the delta variant in unvaccinated populations might lead to a greater burden on health-care services than the alpha variant.\n\nPHE
