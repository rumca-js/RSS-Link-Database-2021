The two Barton bridges over the Manchester Ship Canal open for the flotilla to pass through - these are swing bridges, one for a road, the other the only swing aqueduct in Britain carrying a canal. The torpedo boats exude raw power as they pass, observed by two camera crews, one on either side of the canal.\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.

The city's Victoria Square played host to its first Degree Day ceremony in July 1901, captured in this extract from a four-reel film preserved in the Mitchell & Kenyon collection. Alongside both male and female graduates, look out for the medical students waving bones at the camera. \n\nThe film was shot by Arthur Duncan Thomas, a larger-than life showman given to passing himself off as the American inventor Thomas Edison (for his cheek Thomas was described by British filmmaker Cecil Hepworth as a \"loveable rogue\"). Thomas used four whole rolls of film, to show in sequence at Birmingham's Curzon Hall. The negatives were retained by Mitchell and Kenyon, who would have been paid to process and print the film.\n\nBFI:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-birmingham-university-procession-on-degree-day-1901-1901-online\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
