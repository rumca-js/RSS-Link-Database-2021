I built $40 Haptic Force Feedback gloves for virtual reality. I can now legitimately FEEL what VR feels like and hold objects in my hands. It's the most incredible thing I have ever felt in VR actually. It's amazing. The crazy part is that you can actually build gloves as well! PLus as long as you have a PC of some sort you can use any tracking method whether that be HTC Vive wands, Vive trackers, Knuckles, Oculus Quest's touch controllers, doesn't matter. IT'S SICK. These gloves are made by Lucas VR Tech/ LucidVR and we actually go to his workshop to build a pair! Thank you Lucas!

ALSO if this video gets 15,000 likes, I will build a pair and give it away to a commenter. 

This changes everything.
