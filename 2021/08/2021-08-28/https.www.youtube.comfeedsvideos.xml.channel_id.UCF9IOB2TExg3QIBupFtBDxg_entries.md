USA, Teacher learned she was positive 2 days later

Marin County, California, May 19, under 12s

One teacher, not vaccinated, feeling fatigued with some nasal congestion

Worked on, toot of mask for class reading

Air filter, windows open on two walls

6 feet between desks

Learned she was positive two days later

12 of 24 had been infected

6 symptomatic, 6 asymptomatic

Mostly in the two rows closest to her desk

Outbreak spread to other classes

Siblings and parents, including some who were fully vaccinated

Children under 12, ineligible for vaccines

COVID-19 Projections for K12 Schools in Fall 2021: Significant Transmission without Interventions

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.10.21261726v1

Without testing and masking R0 = 4.0

More than 75% of susceptible students get infected within three
months in all settings

With masks, R0 = 2.0

The proportion infected drops to approximately 50%

Testing further drops infections

High, 22%

Mid, 16%

Low, 13%

Conclusion

Without interventions in place, the vast majority of susceptible students will become infected through the semester. 

Universal masking can reduce student infections by 26-78%, and biweekly testing along with masking reduces infections by another 50%. 

To prevent new infections in the community, limit school absences, and maintain in-person learning, interventions such as masking and testing must be implemented widely, especially among elementary school settings in which children are not yet eligible for the vaccine.

SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) first detected in England in March, 2021

Suspected to cause more severe disease than alpha (B.1.1.7)

Determining the relative risk of hospital attendance

Infections

n = 43,338 COVID-19-positive patients

Most patients were unvaccinated, 32,078 (74·0)

Median age 31, (IQR, 17 – 42)

Delta = 8,682

Alpha = 34,656

Admitted to hospital or sought emergency care within 14 days of positive test

Delta = 498 (5.7%)

Alpha = 1,448 (4·2%)

Adjust for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, recent international travel, area of residence, calendar week, and vaccination status

HR for attendance at emergency care or hospitalisation = 1.45

HR for hospital admission = 2.26

In the subgroup of vaccinated patients

No significant difference between variants for emergency visit or hospitalisation

Interpretation

This large national study found a higher hospital admission or emergency care attendance risk for patients with COVID-19 infected with the delta variant compared with the alpha variant. 

Results suggest that outbreaks of the delta variant in unvaccinated populations might lead to a greater burden on health-care services than the alpha variant.

PHE studies and protection against hospital admission

96% for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccin

92% for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine

UK rates

47.9 million people, (88%) aged 16 and over, first dose of a vaccine

42 million people, (78%) aged 16 and over, have had a second

Dr Gavin Dabrera, PHE

We already know that vaccination offers excellent protection against Delta and, as this variant accounts for over 99% of Covid cases in the UK, it is vital that those who have not received two doses of vaccine do so as soon as possible
 
It is still important that if you have Covid symptoms, stay home and get a PCR test as soon as possible
