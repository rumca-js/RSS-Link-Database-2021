With the brunt of the work falling on rank-and-file soldiers in the unforgiving landscape of Helmand province, the Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan, FRONTLINE embedded with Echo Company of the 2nd Marines, 8th Battalion. Since the Marines' arrival that July, Helmand had become the most lethal battlefield in Afghanistan. But FRONTLINE found the Marines trying to act as armed diplomats, attempting to build the necessary trust for badly needed economic development.\n\nLove FRONTLINE?

Bush addressed the United States.

American aerial bombardments allowed Afghan fighters to push the Taliban out of the country\u2019s capital, Kabul.

He brought in a general who said a surge of tens of thousands of U.S. troops was necessary to turn the war around.\n\nThe general designed a test case: 15,000 troops would try to rout the resurgent Taliban from their stronghold in Marjah. American forces couldn\u2019t hold the territory. They faced ambushes and roadside bombs from the Taliban. The general who recommended the surge called the conflict a \u201cbleeding ulcer.\u201d\n\nWith Marjah, once again an American president was being forced to concede.

The former head of the FBI's flagship antiterrorism unit in New York City, O'Neill had investigated the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa and the USS Cole in Yemen. For five years, he led the fight to track down and prosecute Al Qaeda operatives throughout the world. But he was a controversial figure inside the buttoned-down world of the FBI. O'Neill's critics contend that his personal failings proved fatal to his FBI career. His supporters, however, believe his main failing was refusing to conform to the standard-issue FBI mold.\n\nLove FRONTLINE?
