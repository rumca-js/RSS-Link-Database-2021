Descendents' influence has helped shape the sound of so many other bands, including Foo Fighters, Green Day and Blink-182. \"A lot of the talking heads in the doc,\" Mary says, \"like Dave Grohl, and different people say, if [Descendents] had put out 'Milo Goes to College' \u2014 their very first record, which came out in 1982 \u2014 if they'd put it out in 1996, they'd be huge. There's a lot of people in the documentary who say, 'Yeah, oh, my lord. Yeah, we stole from the Descendents completely,' because what their thing was, was certainly in the vein of punk rock, but with really strong melodic songs.\"\n\nThe film explores all the band members' stories, but possibly most interestingly, that of frontman Milo Aukerman, who balanced his punk-rock dreams with his aspirations to be a scientist.\n\n\"Filmage: The Story of Descendents/All\" is directed by Deedle Lacour and Matt Riggle. It's currently available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video and on VUDU.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#marylucia #thedescendents #miloaukerman", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkkpEV6Vu3s", "date_published": "2021-08-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
