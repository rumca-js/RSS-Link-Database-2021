Kay maintains that his mistake was trusting Sam Pepper and that Sam Pepper was the one who made everything go bad. He accused Sam Pepper of holding up to 12% of the total supply of the coin, and today we're going to address his claims. \n\nBackground: Save the Kids was a crypto that was promoted by the top influencers in the world. \nFaze Kay, Faze Jarvis, Faze Teeqo, Faze Nikan and Ricegum all promoted the coin, along with many other popular influencers being involved.  After this story broke, Kay was kicked out of Faze along with several other members being suspended. Teeqo has been found innocent and recently responded in a video. \n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO: \nMutahar from SomeOrdinaryGamers\nBarely Sociable\n\nFollow Coffeezilla: \n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/coffeebreak_yt/\n\ud83c\udfb6 Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMSQ1yoPT2c&list=PL4qw3AkxFDSNhEgawXD1j6r0iN1072XIB&index=1\nCredits: \n3D Artist: Ed Leszczynski https://www.instagram.com/ed_leszczynski/\nVideo Editor: Harry Bagg  https://twitter.com/HarryBagg96\nMaxwell\ud83e\udd16: Technicals https://youtube.com/c/Technicals\n\nThis video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oltaY5pz5c", "date_published": "2021-08-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
