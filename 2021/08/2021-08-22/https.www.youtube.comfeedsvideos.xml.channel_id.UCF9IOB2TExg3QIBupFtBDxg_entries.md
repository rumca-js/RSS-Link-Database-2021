To find out about natural protection after infection

8,000 adults each day, over 18s can opt in

After PCR test from next Tuesday

Will be sent two home antibody tests

First, ASAP after the positive result

(No infection induced antibodies)

Second, 28 days later to measure antibodies generated by the antigen

NHS test and trace services in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland

Mr Javid

Build on the massive wall of defence from vaccination

strengthen our understanding of Covid-19 as we cautiously return to a more normal life 

Also help to understand non-responders after natural infection

Vaccine induced immunity only, Antibodies to spike protein only

Natural infection induced immunity, Antibodies to spike protein, envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein

UK, this time last year

Case numbers now are more than 30 times higher

20 August 2021,  37,314 

20 August, 2020, 1,182

Most positive cases year, a person with a cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste

Now increased testing for events and trips, picking up more asymptomatics

Hospitalisations and deaths also higher than one year ago

Prof Paul Hunter, University of East Anglia

It wouldn't matter a jot if Covid caused a million cases a month if it didn't make anybody sick. 

It's the actual illnesses which have to drive what we do next

They sort of levelled off but are drifting up again and they're drifting up in summer when viruses spread less readily

There is concern about what will happen in the autumn

A higher base number heading into Autumn

Nearing endemic equilibrium - the point where cases are neither increasing nor falling.

I'm very confident that we're not going to see anything like the amount of disease we saw last time round, in the autumn

Houston, (ITU at/ above capacity)

Having broken bones and bullets in me for over a week now, it’s a little frustrating 

Due to strained resources, surgical patients are being prioritized based on several factors, which unfortunately may result in a delay of nonemergent surgical procedures

Oregon, activated 1,500 members of the National Guard to 20 hospitals

Nitesh N. Paryani radiation oncologist, Tampa

The unvaccinated are killing people in ways they probably never imagined.

My hospital, one of the largest in central Florida, was full of covid patients, more than 90 percent of whom were unvaccinated. 

We had no beds available. 

We had paused elective surgeries the previous week

Our emergency department had a 12-hour wait that day.

But I had no choice. For the first time in my career, I had to say no.

Please, do your part and get vaccinated.

I for one don’t want to have to turn away more people who need care.

Mr Trump

I recommend, take the vaccines, I did it, its good, take the vaccines
