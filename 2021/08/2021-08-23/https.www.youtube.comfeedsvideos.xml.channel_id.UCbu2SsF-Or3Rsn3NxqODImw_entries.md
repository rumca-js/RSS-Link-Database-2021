## Psychonauts 2 Review

Psychonauts 2 does more than just fill the shoes of its beloved quirky predecessor, but sets itself apart as a classic in its own right.

Sixteen years ago, Psychonauts made a cartoonish, comically lopsided world feel believable and weighted thanks to its loveable characters and earnest storytelling. Now, Psychonauts 2 builds upon this foundation to reach ambitious new heights, while equally deepening its roots to impressive depths.

Psychonauts 2 is the quintessential display of Double Fine's mastery in story, gameplay, and distinct direction, making it the studio's best game to date. 

Psychonauts 2 is available now on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox Game Pass, PS4, PS5, and PC.
