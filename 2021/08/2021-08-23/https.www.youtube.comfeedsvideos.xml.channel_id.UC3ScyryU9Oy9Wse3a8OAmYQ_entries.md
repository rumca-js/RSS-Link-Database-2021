In December 2001, as American forces blasted mountain hideouts in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan, hundreds of Al Qaeda soldiers fled seemingly disappearing into thin air. In this 2002 documentary, FRONTLINE investigates what happened to the fighters who survived.

In August of 2002, FRONTLINE veteran producer Martin Smith, his co-producer Marcela Gaviria, and cameraman Scott Anger set out on a two-month journey that took them from London to the Gulf of Oman, into the border regions and teeming cities of Pakistan, and finally to Saudi Arabia and Yemen to investigate what happened to Al Qaeda. Where did its members find sanctuary? Had the network been scattered and rendered ineffective -- or were they regrouping and planning more attacks?
