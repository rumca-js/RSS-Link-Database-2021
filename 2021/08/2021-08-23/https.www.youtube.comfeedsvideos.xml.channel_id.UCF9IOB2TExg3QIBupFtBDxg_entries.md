FDA Approves First COVID-19 Vaccine

EUA since December 11, 2020

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine

Will now be marketed as Comirnaty (koe-mir’-na-tee)

for the prevention of COVID-19 disease in individuals 16 years of age and older

Continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA), 12 to 15s

and for a third dose in immunocompromise

Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D

While this and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, 

as the first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product

we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated. 

Today’s milestone puts us one step closer to altering the course of this pandemic in the U.S.

FDA statement

The mRNA in Comirnaty is only present in the body for a short time and is not incorporated into - nor does it alter - an individual’s genetic material. 

Comirnaty has the same formulation as the EUA vaccine and is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart.

Analyzed effectiveness and safety data from 20,000 vaccine and 20,000 placebo recipients

Vaccine was 91% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease

Safety, approximately 12,000 recipients have been followed for at least 6 months.

The most commonly reported side effects

Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site

Fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain, chills, and fever

Rigorous evaluation of the post-authorization safety surveillance data

Myocarditis and pericarditis

Chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e2.htm

52 million doses to 12–29 years

1,226 reports of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination 42,414

One in 42,414

Data demonstrate increased risks, particularly within the seven days following the second dose
 
The observed risk is higher among males under 40 years of age compared to females and older males

Risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age

Short-term follow-up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms

Some individuals required intensive care support

Information is not yet available about potential long-term health outcomes

FDA and CDC, monitoring systems in place for early detection

Pfizer will

Conduct postmarketing studies to further assess the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis

Include an evaluation of long-term outcomes

Conducting a pregnancy registry study to evaluate pregnancy and infant outcomes after vaccination during pregnancy

To find out about natural protection after infection

8,000 adults each day, over 18s can opt in

After PCR test from next Tuesday

Will be sent two home antibody tests

First, ASAP after the positive result

(No infection induced antibodies)

Second, 28 days later to measure antibodies generated by the antigen

NHS test and trace services in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland

Mr Javid

Build on the massive wall of defence from vaccination

strengthen our understanding of Covid-19 as we cautiously return to a more normal life 

Also help to understand non-responders after natural infection

Vaccine induced immunity only, Antibodies to spike protein only

Natural infection induced immunity, Antibodies to spike protein, envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein

Patients in hospital

Deaths

UK, this time last year

Case numbers now are more than 30 times higher

20 August 2021,  37,314 

20 August, 2020, 1,182

Most positive cases year, a person with a cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste

Now increased testing for events and trips, picking up more asymptomatics

Hospitalisations and deaths also higher than one year ago

Prof Paul Hunter, University of East Anglia

It wouldn't matter a jot if Covid caused a million cases a month if it didn't make anybody sick. 

It's the actual illnesses which have to drive what we do next

They sort of levelled off but are drifting up again and they're drifting up in summer when viruses spread less readily

There is concern about what will happen in the autumn

A higher base number heading into Autumn

Nearing endemic equilibrium - the point where cases are neither increasing nor falling.

I'm very confident that we're not going to see anything like the amount of disease we saw last time round, in the autumn

Houston, (ITU at/ above capacity)

Having broken bones and bullets in me for over a week now, it’s a little frustrating 

Due to strained resources, surgical patients are being prioritized based on several factors, which unfortunately may result in a delay of nonemergent surgical procedures

Oregon, activated 1,500 members of the National Guard to 20 hospitals

Nitesh N. Paryani radiation oncologist, Tampa

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/21/how-unvaccinated-pandemic-threaten-everyones-health/

The unvaccinated are killing people in ways they probably never imagined.

My hospital, one of the largest in central Florida, was full of covid patients, more than 90 percent of whom were unvaccinated. 

We had no beds available. 

We had paused elective surgeries the previous week

Our emergency department had a 12-hour wait that day.

But I had no choice. For the first time in my career, I had to say no.

Please, do your part and get vaccinated.

I for one don’t want to have to turn away more people who need care.

Mr Trump

I recommend, take the vaccines, I did it, its good, take the vaccines
