 Victoria

5 mystery cases

Starting 7 day lockdown today

Brisbane and Sydney

World Health Organization

Halt on booster shots

We cannot and we should not accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected

Covax

Aimed to deliver 2 billion doses this year

(20% of population in needy countries)

So far, 178 million doses to 138 countries.

United States

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html

Cases, + 146,698, up 65% on the week

(AF, could double by Fall)

Hospitalizations, up 46% on the week

Deaths, + 660, up 33% on the week

Fully vaccinated, 50% of population

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations

Dr. Mark Kline, New Orleans

We are seeing some very sick kids

Under 17s, 1 in 5 admissions

FDA to fully approve Pfizer soon

(mandate implications)

90 million eligible but not vaccinated

US international arrivals 

Must be vaccinated once restrictions are lifted

UK cases lower than expected after 19th July

https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-58078900

Sajid Javid, cases 100,000 a day

Prof Neil Ferguson, 200,000

We knew we had to rein things back again

Prof Paul Hunter, University of East Anglia

We have reached some sort of equilibrium

A further surge in cases related to 19 July is now unlikely

Big unknown, what will happen in autumn?

Effects of behaviour on hospital admissions

Prof Mike Tildesley, University of Warwick

Does not expect a significant resurgence unless there is a new variant

but given the success of the vaccination programme I think we can be pretty confident

During a bad flu season, more than 100 deaths and 1,000 hospital admissions every day

Fears for this next flu season

Young adults hospitalised

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-58095503

Amanda Pritchard, NHS chief executive

One in five, between 18 and 34

About 1,000 young adults were currently really unwell in hospital

Level of young adults admissions, four times higher than last winter, (5.5%)

NHS was still experiencing real pressure

Strong vaccine advocacy

NHS teams are putting on pop-up clinics and walk-in centres in addition to around 1,600 permanent sites, to make it as easy as possible to protect yourself, your family and your friends

Alcohol consumption in England

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-consumption-and-harm-during-the-covid-19-pandemic

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-consumption-and-harm-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/monitoring-alcohol-consumption-and-harm-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-summary

Collates data on alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm

Throughout the pandemic and compares to previous years.

Restrictions led to changes in the availability of alcohol, 31-week closure of premises

Changes to alcohol consumption in 2020

Total volume of duty-paid alcohol 2020 to 2021

1.2% less than the year before the pandemic

Wine up 8.9%

Spirits, up 7.3%

Cider, down 16.7%

Beer, down 14%

Heaviest buying quintile accounted for 42% of the total increase

Top buying 50% accounted for 68.3% of sales

Suggests a polarisation in drinking

People who reported drinking more during the pandemic tended to be heavier drinkers

16 and 17-year-olds in the UK will be offered a first dose soon

1.4 million will be eligible

Prof Jonathan Van-Tam

We have the supply and I'm expecting this to start in a very short number of weeks indeed

There is no time to waste in getting on with this

I want us to proceed as fast as is practically possible

Pfizer-BioNTech only

Routinely vaccinating children over 12

United States since May

France Italy, Brazil, Japan, Israel, Hong Kong

Vaccine safety

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-statement-august-2021-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-and-young-people-aged-12-to-17-years/jcvi-statement-on-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-and-young-people-aged-12-to-17-years-4-august-2021

The Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine is administered via intramuscular injection, usually in the upper arm. 

Most frequent reactions aged 12 to 17 years

Injection site pain, fever and headache

Generally mild, self-limiting and short-lived, (1 to 2 days)

FDA data on pericarditis and myocarditis

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-june-25-2021

Onset of symptoms within a few days after vaccination

Particularly following the second dose

Chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart

Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA- 1273

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions

These extremely rare adverse reactions have been more frequent shortly after the second dose, and in younger individuals and males

60 cases per million

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e2.htm

6 or 7 times more common after the second dose

1 in 16,666

1.4 million will be eligible = 84 cases

The mechanism of action underlying these rare events is not currently known

Israel and the United States have reported most of the cases

Milder phenotype

Vast majority recovering swiftly from the acute episode, compared to more typical cases of myocarditis

Benefits of vaccination

Secondary school-aged children in England (early July)

Antibody positive is approximately 40%

England, February 2020 and March 2021

61 deaths after testing positive

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.07.21259779v1

22 from acute infection and three from PIMS

mortality rate of 2/million for the 12,023,568 CYP living in England

Survival rate after testing positive = 99·995% 

Second wave, hospitalisation rate, 100 to 400 per million

Severe neuro-disabilities, Down’s Syndrome, underlying conditions resulting in immunosuppression, severe learning disabilities

March 2020 TO July 2020

449 cases of PIMS in persons under 16 years

44% were admitted to paediatric intensive care

Overall case fatality ratio was 1.1%

Existing studies suggest that longer term (more than 8 weeks) symptoms following SARS-CoV2 infection occur in about 1% to 10% of persons after COVID-19

Avoiding school and class-based measures

Benefits to adult is highly uncertain

UK, cases up a bit today
