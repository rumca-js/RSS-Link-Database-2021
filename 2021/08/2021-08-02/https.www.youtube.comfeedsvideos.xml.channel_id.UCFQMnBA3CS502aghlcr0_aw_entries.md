Jay Mazini ran his bitcoin scam for a while before getting charged by the FBI! But before that happened, he was also charged with kidnapping and put in jail... I haven't spoken much about that until now.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.

H3H3 and Hasan Piker recently confronted Adin Ross on stream and got deliberately or inadvertently lied to when Ross asserted that his promotion was "bad". 
The blockchain suggests the promotion increased 24hr volume by millions of dollars.
