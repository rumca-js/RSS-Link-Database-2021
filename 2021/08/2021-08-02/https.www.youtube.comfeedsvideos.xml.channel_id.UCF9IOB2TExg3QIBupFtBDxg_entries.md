UK R value, 1.0-1.1

England, 1.1

Wales, 1.0

Scotland, 0.8

England, North East, trending slightly down

Tim Spector

New COVID cases have stopped rising for the last week

Holding steady around the 60,000 mark

Stark contrast to the rapid decline in cases recorded by the governmentâ€™s official confirmed cases data

leaving the accuracy of the official tally in doubt

it could be that we are now testing the wrong people

still a very strict and limited symptom list in place
