A new journey begins on September 2, 2022!  We'll do a quick stream to have some fun talking about a beautiful new image from Middle-earth, theorize the locations and character(s) in it, and what this could mean for the show!  The official Amazon Lord of the Rings on Prime Twitter account revealed the release date and first image for the show earlier today (Aug 2, 2021).

Check out these videos for more on things we discussed in the stream!
