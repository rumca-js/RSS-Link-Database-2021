As soon as you’ve sucked out all the blood you can from them, as soon as they’re no longer useful to you, as soon as your priorities change, that’s where the switch comes in: the favors suddenly come to a halt, you’re no longer at their beck and call, you turn a cold shoulder, you stop answering their phone calls And that’s exactly what Elon Musk and Tesla is experiencing right now with the Chinese Government.

China is the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles. So it’s not surprising that Tesla saw the chance of dominating the Chinese EV market as a no-brainer. Tesla entering the Chinese market was good for the Chinese government as well. A couple months later, Tesla and the Shanghai government sealed the deal for a Tesla gigafactory able to produce up to half a million EVs a year. And the good times just kept rolling. 

Elon Musk had become the Chinese president’s favorite capitalist. Which raises the question, what did China really want out of it? Tesla did in fact raise the bar for local EV manufacturers like Nio and Xpeng: their tech was getting better, and their sales had been on the rise. All of a sudden, Tesla wasn’t so useful to the Chinese government anymore, their priorities changed.

Tesla quickly started running into problems. Suddenly, Tesla executives were being summoned by China Regulators to “discuss” safety issues in their cars, including reports of random acceleration and battery fires. Tesla really started feeling the change in the government's favor, when some of its cars were banned from military complexes over fears that they could be sending their camera data back to the US government. China dealt another blow to the company, stating that all smart cars would need to store their data in-country. Things just kept getting worse. Local governments started reviewing Tesla ownership among their employees, and then came the last straw. 

After claiming Tesla EVs’ autopilot system could be activated automatically and possibly lead to crashes, Beijing ordered pretty much all of the nearly 300k Tesla cars sold in China to be recalled, and their software upgraded for free to fix the safety issue. Tesla had to apologize. Again. 

Tesla is still doing well overall.
