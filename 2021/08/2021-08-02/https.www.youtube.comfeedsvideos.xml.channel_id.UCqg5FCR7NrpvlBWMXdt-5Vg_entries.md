## Why The Expanse Was Locked Out of the Emmys | In The Frame

Every awards season brings its share of flubs and snubs, overlooking shows or performances that deserve recognition. Here at The Escapist, we are big fans of The Expanse. Personally, I have singled it out as a worthy successor to Game of Thrones and the defining science fiction show of the past 10 years. The Expanse absolutely deserves more awards and the attention that more mainstream recognition would bring to the show. Even with a single season left to broadcast, it is a monumental accomplishment that deserves consideration among the peaks of the modern television landscape.
