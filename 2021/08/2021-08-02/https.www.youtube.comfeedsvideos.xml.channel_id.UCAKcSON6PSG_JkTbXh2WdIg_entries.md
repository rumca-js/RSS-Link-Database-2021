Last Friday, prolific singer-songwriter Jim Lauderdale released "Hope," his 34th album to date! Three years ago, Lauderdale visited The Current's studio to record a session for Radio Heartland; at that time, the two-time Grammy Award-winner, North Carolina Music Hall of Fame inductee and Americana-music icon was touring in support of "Time Flies," his album from that year. Watch two songs from that 2018 session.
