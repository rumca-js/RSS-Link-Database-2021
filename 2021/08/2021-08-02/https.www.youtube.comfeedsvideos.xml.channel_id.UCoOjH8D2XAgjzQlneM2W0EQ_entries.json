So it\u2019s not surprising that Tesla saw the chance of dominating the Chinese EV market as a no-brainer. Tesla entering the Chinese market was good for the Chinese government as well. A couple months later, Tesla and the Shanghai government sealed the deal for a Tesla gigafactory able to produce up to half a million EVs a year. And the good times just kept rolling. \n\nElon Musk had become the Chinese president\u2019s favorite capitalist. Which raises the question, what did China really want out of it? Tesla did in fact raise the bar for local EV manufacturers like Nio and Xpeng: their tech was getting better, and their sales had been on the rise. All of a sudden, Tesla wasn\u2019t so useful to the Chinese government anymore, their priorities changed.\n\nTesla quickly started running into problems. Suddenly, Tesla executives were being summoned by China Regulators to \u201cdiscuss\u201d safety issues in their cars, including reports of random acceleration and battery fires. Tesla really started feeling the change in the government's favor, when some of its cars were banned from military complexes over fears that they could be sending their camera data back to the US government. China dealt another blow to the company, stating that all smart cars would need to store their data in-country. Things just kept getting worse. Local governments started reviewing Tesla ownership among their employees, and then came the last straw. \n\nAfter claiming Tesla EVs\u2019 autopilot system could be activated automatically and possibly lead to crashes, Beijing ordered pretty much all of the nearly 300k Tesla cars sold in China to be recalled, and their software upgraded for free to fix the safety issue. Tesla had to apologize. Again. \n\nTesla is still doing well overall.\n-----------------------\nSwuM - Self Luv https://chll.to/69f5481a\nNo Spirit - Slightly Improvised https://chll.to/6347930b\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
