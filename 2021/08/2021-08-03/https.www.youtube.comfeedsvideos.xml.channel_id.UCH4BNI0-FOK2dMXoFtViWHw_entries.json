In this special limited series, Emily Graslie and Trace Dominguez join me as we explore the universal rules of life that tie together Earth\u2019s living systems. In episode 3, we look at ecosystems at their largest and smallest scales of time and size from the Serengeti to Andrews Experimental Forestin Oregon. How does the cycling of nutrients and molecules make life possible on Earth? Who are these recyclers and scavengers? Sometimes this recycling happens fast and violently, and sometimes it happens slow and beautifully.\n\nIn Our Nature is a special miniseries produced by It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart for PBS. Stay tuned for more episodes coming this summer, here on our YouTube channel!\n\nOriginal Production Funding provided by: Anne Ray Foundation, a Margaret A.
