As I've said in a previous video, I spent a lot of time on GNOME 2 when it was the default on Ubuntu, and I know most of its default apps like the back of my hand. It's been 10 years since I've used GNOME 2 though, and MATE has evolved past that, so let's see you get out of the box, and if that's any good.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4f SUPPORT THE CHANNEL:\nGet access to an exclusive weekly podcast, vote on the next topics I cover, and get your name in the credits:\n\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5UAwBUum7CPN5buc-_N1Fw/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thelinuxexperiment\n\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 FOLLOW ME ELSEWHERE:\nTwitter : http://twitter.com/thelinuxEXP\n\nMy Gaming on Linux Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaw_Lz7oifDb-PZCAcZ07kw\nFollow me on ODYSEE: https://odysee.com/@TheLinuxExperiment:e\nOr join ODYSEE: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@TheLinuxExperiment:e\n\n\n\n00:00 Intro\n01:34 File Manager\n03:41 Terminal\n05:16 Text Editor\n06:18 Utilities\n07:47 Missing Parts\n10:00 Parting Thoughts\n\nThe FIle manager is a fork of Nautilus, which was the default GNOME 2 file manager, and is also the name for GNOME 3's file Wanna get your own Linux server?

It's a fork of GNOME 2's GEDIT, and it bears considerable familiarity with it. \nIt's a simple text editor, with tabs, printing support, search and replace tools, spellcheck, or statistics on the document you're currently editing.\n\nIt also has a side pane that lets you move from document to document, or navigate the filesystem, so you could even use it to write and edit code since it supports syntax coloration for a lot of languages.\n\nThe Utilities\n\nMATE does ship with a bunch of utilities, including an image viewer, a document viewer, an archive manager, a calculator, a font viewer, a search tool, a color selection utility, a dictionary, a disk usage analyser, and a system monitor.\n\nThese are all forks of GNOME 2's equivalent utilities\n\nWhat's lacking\n\nMATE, like XFCE, lacks a few applications to complete its desktop environment though.\nFirst, there is no default app store: GNOME has GNOME Software, KDE has Discover, Pantheon has the AppCenter, but MATE doesn't have anything of its own.\n\nThere is also no default media player, either for video, or audio, which is also a pretty big deal: distros have to cover that themselves as well.\n\nOn Fedora, they use the Parole Media player, from XFCE, and dnfdragora as a package manager. The former is fine, the latter is definitely not user friendly enough for a beginner.\n\nI think desktops that stick to the menubar paradigm should pull their forces and maybe work on some common applications to fill in these gaps.\n\nYou also won't find a default calendar app, or email client.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the application set for MATE is good. The file manager is definitely a highlight, with its tight integration with the places menu, and its multi purpose side panel.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg_be5GZyp0", "date_published": "2021-08-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
