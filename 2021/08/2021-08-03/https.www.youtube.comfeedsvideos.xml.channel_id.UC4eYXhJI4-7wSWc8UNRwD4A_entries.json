Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAbby O'Neill | August 4, 2021\nMelbourne alt-soul collective Hiatus Kaiyote tricked out its avant-garde recording studio, The Villa, and lathered it with props: a miniature desk, alien costumes, and loads of furry friends. Frontwoman Nai Palm shared with me the impetus behind the design. \"I'm a treasure hunter at heart,\" she said, \"and the beautiful thing about dressing a set with sentimental artifacts from my house is that I feel super comfy to perform.\" Every intricate detail of this Tiny Desk (home) concert evokes feelings of coziness, psychedelia and joyful performance art.\n\nLaunching into this brilliant performance with \"Sip Into Something Soft,\" Hiatus takes us on a sweet and sultry journey through a host of selections from their new album, Mood Valiant. On \"Rose Water,\" the tightness of the band (comprised of Paul Bender, Simon Mavin and Perrin Moss, and joined by their longtime backing vocalists) is on full display.\n\nHiatus Kaiyote came onto the scene with their debut album, Tawk Tomahawk, back in 2012 and created a groundswell of buzz among global music heads. Since then, they've gone on to win varying international awards and were the first Australian group to get nominated in the R&B category at the Grammys for best R&B performance in 2013. This uber-fun and exhilarating set will appease diehards and new fans alike.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Sip Into Something Soft\"\n\"Rose Water\"\n\"And We Go Gentle\"\n\"Get Sun\"\n\"Blood And Marrow\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNai Palm: vocals, guitar\nPaul Bender: bass\nSimon Mavin: keys\nPerrin Moss: drums, percussion, vibraphone\nAlejandro 'Silentjay' Abapo: vocals, keys\nLaura Christoforidis: vocals\nJace Excell: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Nick Mckk, Leah Oborn\nAudio: Phil Noy, Haima Marriott\nExtras: Marissa Matar, Sam Kuzich (aliens); Daniela Lucchetti, Matt Kelly (birds); Kiki Megumi (mothman)\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Maia Stern, Gabrielle Pierre\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#hiatuskaiyote #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCK1QnrTXvA", "date_published": "2021-08-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Dinosaur Jr.: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nStephen Thompson | Aug. 3, 2021\nIn the year-plus that we\u2019ve been recording Tiny Desk (home) concerts, artists have worked hard to reproduce the Tiny Desk vibe through special effects ranging from Phoebe Bridgers\u2019 Oval Office backdrop to clipping.\u2019s tininess-enhancing miniature set. For Dinosaur Jr., the spirit of the Tiny Desk can be found in an under-appreciated facet of the series: the ever-evolving array of tchotchkes, promo pieces and other bits of pop-cultural detritus that line the shelves behind Bob Boilen\u2019s desk.\n\nDinosaur Jr.\u2019s own home concert \u2014 \u201chome\u201d in this case being the stage of an empty Shea Theater in Turners Falls, Mass. \u2014 is set amid its own enviable assortment of oddities, from stuffed animals to a Mork action figure to a copy of the album A Christmas Together by John Denver & The Muppets. And you don\u2019t stick around as a band for all or part of five decades without knowing a little something about product placement: Dinosaur Jr.\u2019s terrific new album, Sweep It Into Space, is prominently located near the wee plastic desk that sits front and center onstage.\n\nNaturally, that album dominates this five-song set, which finds the trio of singer-guitarist J Mascis, singer-bassist Lou Barlow and drummer Murph sounding as fluid and forceful and gnarly as ever. Mascis gets to unleash a few shredding solos, Barlow gets to take the lead in \u201cGarden\u201d and Murph gets to do his thing in close proximity to a pair of large dinosaur-shaped balloons. Plus, longtime fans get treated to two towering classics from earlier in Dinosaur Jr.\u2019s excellent career: \u201cFeel the Pain,\u201d from 1994\u2019s Without a Sound, and \u201cFreak Scene,\u201d which opens 1988\u2019s Bug.\n\nSET LIST\n\"I Ain't\"\n\"Garden\"\n\"Feel the Pain\"\n\"I Ran Away\"\n\"Freak Scene\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJ Mascis: vocals, guitar, bass\nLou Barlow: vocals, bass, guitar\nMurph: drums\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Joe Salinas\n1st AD: John William Moloney\nCamera Operators: Chris Hillen, Robert Thomas, John Moloney, Joe Salinas\nEditor/Colorist: Joe Salinas\nAssistant Editor: Chris Hillen, Justin Pizzoferrato\nArt Director/Set Design: John William Moloney\nSound Mixer/Sound Design: Justin Pizzoferrato\nLighting Technician: Wyatt Andrews\nProduction Assistant: Marc Seedorf\nExecutive Producers: Amy Abrams, Brian Schwartz\nProducer: John William Moloney\nFilmed at the Shea Theater in Turner Falls, MA\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Alex Drewenskus\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Josh Rogosin, Gabrielle Pierre\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #dinosaurjr", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxbGf_JyvVs", "date_published": "2021-08-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
