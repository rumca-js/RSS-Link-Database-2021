Uptime.Lab's 1U Blade is a rack-mountable Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4-based server.

UPDATE: The Compute Blade will be on Kickstarterâ€”here's the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/uptimelab/compute-blade?ref=bfyfme (or check out https://computeblade.com)

Capable of cramming 64 ARM CPU cores in 1U of rack space, this blade could make a powerful Pi cluster. And built-in features like PoE+ support, an M.2 slot for NVMe SSDs, and a TPM 2.0 module make it the best performing Pi server, ever!
