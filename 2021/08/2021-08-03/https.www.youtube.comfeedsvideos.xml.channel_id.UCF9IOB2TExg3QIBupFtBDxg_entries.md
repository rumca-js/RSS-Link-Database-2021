Benefits of vaccination

Secondary school-aged children in England (early July)

Antibody positive is approximately 40%

England, February 2020 and March 2021

61 deaths after testing positive

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.07.21259779v1

22 from acute infection and three from PIMS

mortality rate of 2/million for the 12,023,568 CYP living in England

Survival rate after testing positive = 99·995% 

Second wave, hospitalisation rate, 100 to 400 per million

Severe neuro-disabilities, Down’s Syndrome, underlying conditions resulting in immunosuppression, severe learning disabilities

March 2020 TO July 2020

449 cases of PIMS in persons under 16 years

44% were admitted to paediatric intensive care

Overall case fatality ratio was 1.1%

Existing studies suggest that longer term (more than 8 weeks) symptoms following SARS-CoV2 infection occur in about 1% to 10% of persons after COVID-19

New symptomatic cases is 60,480

Unvaccinated people, 36,102 new daily symptomatic cases

Remained stable over the past six days

Suggesting that new cases have stopped rising in the UK

37,549,060 people in the UK have received two doses

Prevalence

One in 82 people in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID

UK R value, 1.0-1.1

England, 1.1

Wales, 1.0

Scotland, 0.8

England, North East, trending slightly down

Tim Spector

New COVID cases have stopped rising for the last week

Holding steady around the 60,000 mark

Stark contrast to the rapid decline in cases recorded by the government’s official confirmed cases data

leaving the accuracy of the official tally in doubt

it could be that we are now testing the wrong people

still a very strict and limited symptom list in place
