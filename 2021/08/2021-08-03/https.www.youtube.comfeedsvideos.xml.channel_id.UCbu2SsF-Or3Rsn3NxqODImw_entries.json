Let's take a look at a few reasons why you might want to try it out for yourself.\n\n\nCall of Duty Mobile is a sleeping giant. Even with more than 500 million downloads, it\u2019s fan base is a relatively quiet bunch. For a game packed to the brim with content (much of it for free) it\u2019s astounding how little COD Mobile hits the radar of Call of Duty fans as a whole. Everything from fan-favorite maps to every operator you can think of, there\u2019s more than enough to satisfy fans of the series. In this video Richie Bracamonte discusses seven reasons why you should try Call of Duty Mobile.   \n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to love about COD mobile. Most of which gets little love in the world of FPS and Mobile gaming. Whether you\u2019re partial to Apple, Android or even PC, COD Mobile is a free-to-play game. Not only does it contain multiplayer with classic maps, but also included is a Battle Royale mode and rebooted Zombies siege mode. Whichever mode you play, you\u2019re rewarded with loads of weapon skins, XP, and even COD credits that let you choose from a store of more unlockable goodies. \n\n\nMainline Call of Duty games on consoles and PC will always get exposure. Every year they\u2019re highly marketed and have no trouble making headlines. But maybe after checking out Richie\u2019s list, you\u2019ll consider taking Call of Duty with you on the go, too. Stay up to date with Call of Duty and other upcoming FPS games like Halo Infinite and Battlefield 2042 on GameSpot.com and Gamespot\u2019s YouTube page.\n\n#cod #callofduty #codmobile", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAh0DrS9LEo", "date_published": "2021-08-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Hades, Katamari Damacy Reroll, Skate | Xbox Game Pass Show", "description": "Learn about what's new, what's leaving, and what you should be playing on Game Pass.
