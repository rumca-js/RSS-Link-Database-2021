Today we dive into the original seven fathers of the dwarves and their respective houses: the Longbeards, Blacklocks, Broadbeams, Firebeards, Ironfists, Stonefoots, and Stiffbeards.  We will also cover the Petty-dwarves and their hostility toward the elves.  Follow each house of the dwarves throughout their history in both Beleriand and Middle-earth!  We will even see some brand new information from the pages of "The Nature of Middle-earth"!
