Public Health England (PHE) and Medical Research Council

SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) first detected in England in March, 2021

Suspected to cause more severe disease than alpha (B.1.1.7)

Determining the relative risk of hospital attendance

England between March 29 and May 23, 2021

All infected with alpha or delta

Public Health England’s Second-Generation Surveillance System

COVID-19-associated deaths dataset

National Immunisation Management System

NHS Digital Secondary Uses Services and Emergency Care Data Set

Infections

n = 43,338 COVID-19-positive patients

Most patients were unvaccinated, 32,078 (74·0)

Median age 31, (IQR, 17 – 42)

Delta = 8,682

Alpha = 34,656

Admitted to hospital or sought emergency care within 14 days of positive test

Delta = 498 (5.7%)

Alpha = 1,448 (4·2%)

Adjust for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, recent international travel, area of residence, calendar week, and vaccination status

HR for attendance at emergency care or hospitalisation = 1.45

HR for hospital admission = 2.26

In the subgroup of vaccinated patients

No significant difference between variants for emergency visit or hospitalisation

Interpretation

This large national study found a higher hospital admission or emergency care attendance risk for patients with COVID-19 infected with the delta variant compared with the alpha variant. 

Results suggest that outbreaks of the delta variant in unvaccinated populations might lead to a greater burden on health-care services than the alpha variant.

PHE studies and protection against hospital admission

96% for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccin

92% for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine

UK rates

47.9 million people, (88%) aged 16 and over, first dose of a vaccine

42 million people, (78%) aged 16 and over, have had a second

Dr Gavin Dabrera, PHE

We already know that vaccination offers excellent protection against Delta and, as this variant accounts for over 99% of Covid cases in the UK, it is vital that those who have not received two doses of vaccine do so as soon as possible
 
It is still important that if you have Covid symptoms, stay home and get a PCR test as soon as possible

Lancet study findings are consistent with Scottish data

The 90th day, Intelligence community inconclusive report

Mr. Biden

Tasked intelligence agencies, that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion

You’re going to have to increase your ranks with people with significant scientific capacity relative to pathogens

Intelligence officials fell short of a consensus

May

Agencies coalesced around two likely scenarios

Now

Two agencies, leaned toward the hypothesis that the virus emerged from human contact with an infected animal

Third, leaned toward the lab accident scenario

Dozens of analysts and intelligence officials

Multiple agencies

David Relman, Stanford University microbiologist

We should not even be thinking about closing the book or backing off, but rather ratcheting up the effort

Wuhan Lab, has not released its records

World Health Organization

Lab leak extremely unlikely
