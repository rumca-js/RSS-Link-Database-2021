Council\n\nSARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) first detected in England in March, 2021\n\nSuspected to cause more severe disease than alpha (B.1.1.7)\n\nDetermining the relative risk of hospital attendance\n\nEngland between March 29 and May 23, 2021\n\nAll infected with alpha or delta\n\nPublic Health England\u2019s Second-Generation Surveillance System\n\nCOVID-19-associated deaths

emergency care or hospitalisation = 1.45\n\nHR for hospital admission = 2.26\n\nIn the subgroup of vaccinated patients\n\nNo significant difference between variants for emergency visit or hospitalisation\n\nInterpretation\n\nThis large national study found a higher hospital admission or emergency care attendance risk for patients with COVID-19 infected with the delta variant compared with the alpha variant. \n\nResults suggest that outbreaks of the delta variant in unvaccinated populations might lead to a greater burden on health-care services than the alpha variant.\n\nPHE
