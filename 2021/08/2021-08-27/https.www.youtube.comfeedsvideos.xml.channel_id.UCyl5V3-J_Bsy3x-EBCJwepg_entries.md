Kyle and Ethan are joined by our friendly neighborhood professor of theology, Dr. Thaddeus Williams. He is the author of Confronting Injustice Without Compromising Truth (https://www.amazon.com/Confronting-Injustice-without-Compromising-Truth/dp/0310119480) and God Reforms Hearts: Rethinking Free Will and the Problem of Evil (https://www.amazon.com/God-Reforms-Hearts-Rethinking-Problem/dp/1683594975/ref=sr_1_4?crid=ETLXLM9GB31M&dchild=1&keywords=thaddeus+williams&qid=1629828040&sprefix=micro+h%2Caps%2C220&sr=8-4). 

As usual, they dig into the weird news of the week, but they also get an update from Ethan’s wife about her experience getting a mandatory jab, and talk to Dr. Williams about how free will doesn’t get God off the hook for all the evil in the world.
