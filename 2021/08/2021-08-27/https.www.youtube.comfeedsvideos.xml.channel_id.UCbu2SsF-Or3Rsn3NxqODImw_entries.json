There was no additional footage given. Only new screenshots. \n\nDespite how little we've seen of Elden Ring, those familiar with From Software's catalogue will have a good idea of what to expect. Surprising absolutely no one, Elden Ring is a dark fantasy action RPG set in an intricately constructed world. It delivers its narrative in fragmented pieces, leaving the player to make connections, fill in the gaps, and draw conclusions. Its gameplay marries the tension of venturing into the unknown with the joy of discovery and, most importantly, it emphasizes a sense of accomplishment that comes from conquering seemingly insurmountable challenges.\u00a0\n\nElden Ring is the exact kind of game that From Software is known for creating, but it's also an exciting evolution that takes the best of what came before and extrapolates it out onto a much grander scale, potentially realizing that open-world Soulsborne fantasy that many fans have been eager for.\n\nIn the video above, Tamoor Hussain discusses 7 new takeaways from a behind-closed-doors gameplay presentation that he attended at Gamescom 2021. Elden Ring will release on January 21 2022 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PC.\n\n#elden ring7 #eldenring7 #gamescom 2021", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOTPRZ5cJno", "date_published": "2021-08-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "No More Heroes 3 Review", "description": "No More Heroes 3 is at its best when you're slicing your way through alien invaders, but the rest of the game wrapped around the energetic combat is a laborious disappointment.\n\nGrasshopper Manufacture's No More Heroes 3 is now available on Nintendo Switch.
