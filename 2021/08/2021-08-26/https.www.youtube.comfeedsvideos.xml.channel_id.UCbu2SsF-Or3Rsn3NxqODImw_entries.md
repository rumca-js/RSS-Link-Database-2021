Tamoor recently got to see Elden Ring in action in a behind-closed-doors session at Gamescom 2021, here’s everything he learned about From Software’s upcoming open-world adventure. There was no additional footage given. Only new screenshots. 

Despite how little we've seen of Elden Ring, those familiar with From Software's catalogue will have a good idea of what to expect. Surprising absolutely no one, Elden Ring is a dark fantasy action RPG set in an intricately constructed world. It delivers its narrative in fragmented pieces, leaving the player to make connections, fill in the gaps, and draw conclusions. Its gameplay marries the tension of venturing into the unknown with the joy of discovery and, most importantly, it emphasizes a sense of accomplishment that comes from conquering seemingly insurmountable challenges. 

Elden Ring is the exact kind of game that From Software is known for creating, but it's also an exciting evolution that takes the best of what came before and extrapolates it out onto a much grander scale, potentially realizing that open-world Soulsborne fantasy that many fans have been eager for.

In the video above, Tamoor Hussain discusses 7 new takeaways from a behind-closed-doors gameplay presentation that he attended at Gamescom 2021. Elden Ring will release on January 21 2022 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PC.

No More Heroes 3 is at its best when you're slicing your way through alien invaders, but the rest of the game wrapped around the energetic combat is a laborious disappointment.

## Destiny 2: The Witch Queen - What You Need To Know

Destiny 2’s latest expansion The Witch Queen has been officially revealed with a lot of new content for fans to experience. From a new antagonist and campaign, to a brand new raid, we dive into all the big things you need to know about the latest expansion.

Bungie has been on a tear lately with Destiny’s story telling. The developer has expanded its past seasonal stories in a cohesive and evolving manner and fans were eagerly anticipating the reveal for Destiny’s next large expansion, The Witch Queen. The reveal is here--and it’s juicy. Bungie officially dropped tons of info about the new expansion and its story premise, finally giving us a look into the brand new antagonist, Savathun.

Savathun will be our largest threat yet, and is able to grant the gift of the Light to her brood. That’s right, weak Hive knights, wizards, and other Hive enemies are now essentially Guardians who can wield the Light’s power against us, which is really saying something. The campaign and new story will have us traveling to Savathun’s throne world, where we will challenge her Lucent Brood and attempt to get to the heart of it all and pierce through her lies and facades. 

There’s a ton of new content coming to The Witch Queen, which we detail in the video, such as the brand new raid that will take place in a sunken Pyramid ship. We also delve into weapon crafting, a first for the game, and break down the Glaive, a first-of-its-kind melee weapon. Additionally, there are new seasonal activities, and more content to look forward to when the new expansion finally drops.

Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is slated for release in February 2022, and will be available on Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PS4, PS5, PC, and Google Stadia. There will be a standard edition with just the expansion, and a deluxe edition that includes a season pass with plenty of end game content like brand new dungeons and raids in future seasons. Hardcore fans can up the ante with the physical collectors edition, which costs a good chunk of change but comes with really cool limited edition goodies like a Hive Ghost. Be sure to subscribe to GameSpot for more Destiny content!

Steve Watts got a hands-off preview of the new Saints Row during Gamescom 2021. Learn more about what he got to see, and what he learned from a Q&A.

The new Saints Row, announced at Gamescom, is a total reboot for the series--not just in setting and characters but in tone. While it looks primed to carry forward the same playfully zany spirit as its predecessors, the new game--simply called Saints Row--is clearly taking a step back and allowing developer Volition some breathing room without having to constantly top itself with ever-expanding wacky hijinks.
