Mr. Biden

Tasked intelligence agencies, that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion

You’re going to have to increase your ranks with people with significant scientific capacity relative to pathogens

Now

Two agencies, leaned toward the hypothesis that the virus emerged from human contact with an infected animal

Third, leaned toward the lab accident scenario

Dozens of analysts and intelligence officials

Multiple agencies

David Relman, Stanford University microbiologist

We should not even be thinking about closing the book or backing off, but rather ratcheting up the effort

Wuhan Lab, has not released its records

World Health Organization

Lab leak extremely unlikely
