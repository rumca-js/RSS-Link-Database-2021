The Church Lads' Brigade was formed in 1891, inspired by the Boys' Brigade (formed eight years earlier). Similar youth organisations, typically with a quasi-military ethos, were on the increase during the Edwardian period, which also saw the rise of the Girls' Brigade and the Scouts movements.\n\nWikipedia:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morecambe_Church_Lads%27_Brigade_at_Drill\n\nBFI:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-morecambe-church-lads-parade-at-drill-1901-1901-online\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
