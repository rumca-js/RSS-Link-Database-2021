\n\nImmune top ups occur with respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, four other coronaviruses\n\nProf Adam Finn, government vaccine adviser\n\nThis isn't proven, but it could be a lot cheaper and simpler to let that happen than spend the whole time immunising people\n\nWe could end up locked into a cycle of boosting without seeing if it was necessary\n\nIn children, argument had already been won\n\n 40-50% have already been infected and most weren't ill or particularly ill\n\nProf Eleanor Riley, immunologist, University of Edinburgh\n\nUsing vaccines to take the edge off Covid, \n\nfollowed by infection, \n\nto broaden the immune response\n\nWe really need to consider, are we just frightening people rather than giving them the confidence to get on with their lives?
