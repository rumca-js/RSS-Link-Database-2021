In part one of Money, Power and Wall Street, FRONTLINE correspondent Martin Smith interviews leading bankers, government officials and journalists to chart the epic rise of a new financial order—and the trouble that followed. As Wall Street innovated, its revenues skyrocketed, and financial institutions of all stripes tied their fortunes to one another. Smith probes deeply into the story of the big banks—how they developed, how they profited, and how the model that produced unfathomable wealth planted the seeds of financial destruction.
