Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, once again breaks down the weaponry of the TimeSplitters franchise, including a silenced Luger pistol, the Walther WA2000 sniper rifle, and a particularly cursed hybrid of a Desert Eagle and a Beretta 92 pistol.

In the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of the TimeSplitters franchise and compares them to their real-life counterparts.

TimeSplitters, TimeSplitters 2 and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect is one of the most beloved shooter trilogies in console gaming history. But it’s been 16 long years since the last entry to the franchise, and first-person shooters have changed dramatically in that time. With a new TimeSplitters game on the horizon, how well does the original trilogy hold up in 2021?

Back in May, Deep Silver announced the reformation of Free Radical Design, creators of the original TimeSplitters trilogy, and their first task is a new entry to the classic shooter franchise. Can a sequel retain the chaotic, uncomplicated joy of the original games?

Surely a remake or remaster of the TimeSplitters trilogy can't be far away, but in the meantime join Chris as he digs out a dusty old PS2, plugs in a shonky pad and revisits three of the best console shooters ever made.

## Battlefield 2042 - Irish Specialist Breakdown And How Story Works

Battlefield 2042 releases in October and might not have a campaign, but its story is already hitting hard by killing off a Battlefield 4 character and introducing the horrors of being stateless. The Exodus Short Film Trailer introduces a new engineer Specialist Irish who can deploy cover and grenade interceptors as well as sets up what looks like a Season 1 fight over a downed secret weapon on the Hourglass map. 

Battlefield 2042 seems like it will tell a gripping story despite not having a single-player campaign. The Exodus Short Film Trailer revealed a lot about how Specialists’ struggles will be revealed through the different seasons and what kind of scenarios players will be thrown into through the multiplayer All-Out Warfare mode. 

In this video, we’re going to go over details from the trailer. The story so far includes two returning Battlefield 4 characters, Irish and Pakowski. There’s a larger conflict brewing between the United States and Russia and also a much more personal conflict between No-Pats--people who've been driven from their home countries by natural disasters and political turmoil. The story sets up a conflict between Irish and Oz: Irish is a former US Marine who has broken away to save his family and wants acceptance for the refugees under his watch, while Oz is a shadowy figure who wants to start a war between superpowers by uncovering state secrets. The trailer ends by setting up a scenario on the Hourglass map, where players seem to be able to fight for one side or the other over a crashed prototype weapon.
 
In this video, we will also break down the new Specialist. Irish is an Engineer Class. His unique equipment allows him to build a Fortification System called DCS deployable cover. He can also deploy a device to shoot down explosives called the APS-36. His Trait is Veteran, which gives him extra armor.

DICE is currently running a Battlefield 2042 technical alpha test, with open betas coming in September and the game's full release in October.

## You Need To Play Splitgate

Splitgate sells itself as "Halo meets Portal", and has recently blown up in popularity. Jean-Luc is here to tell you the game is the real deal and worth checking out.

This free-to-play early access shooter has actually been around for over 2 years now but recently it has taken the internet by storm going from a peak player count of less than 1,000 back in June to over 67,000 at the time of this video and growing, thanks to it’s recent release on PlayStation and Xbox. In an age where the competitive shooter space is highly crowded, and indie shooters don’t really make much of an impression, this is impressive to say the least. It begs two questions, what makes Splitgate so damn appealing and should you play it?
