This week, Mary Lucia talks about a music documentary that chronicles Descendents, one of her favorite punk bands of all time. 

"Filmage: The Story of Descendents/All" came out in 2013. Descendents' influence has helped shape the sound of so many other bands, including Foo Fighters, Green Day and Blink-182. "A lot of the talking heads in the doc," Mary says, "like Dave Grohl, and different people say, if [Descendents] had put out 'Milo Goes to College' — their very first record, which came out in 1982 — if they'd put it out in 1996, they'd be huge. There's a lot of people in the documentary who say, 'Yeah, oh, my lord. Yeah, we stole from the Descendents completely,' because what their thing was, was certainly in the vein of punk rock, but with really strong melodic songs."

The film explores all the band members' stories, but possibly most interestingly, that of frontman Milo Aukerman, who balanced his punk-rock dreams with his aspirations to be a scientist.

"Filmage: The Story of Descendents/All" is directed by Deedle Lacour and Matt Riggle. It's currently available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video and on VUDU.
