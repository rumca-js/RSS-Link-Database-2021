Everyone seems to be asking, so I figured I'd answer. I'll explain what I use my small Pi clusters for, and what some other people use them for.

But also, why cluster in the first place? Can't you just buy an EPYC 64-core CPU and an RTX 3080 and have all the processing power you'd ever need?

Maybe. But color me skeptical!
