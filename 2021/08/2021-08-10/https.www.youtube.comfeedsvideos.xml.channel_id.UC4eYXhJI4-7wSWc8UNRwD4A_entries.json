Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nStephen Thompson | Aug, 10, 2021\nFlock of Dimes\u00a0may be a \"solo\" project for\u00a0Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner, but she couldn't pass up an opportunity to invite a few friends over. You'll spot their familiar faces all over this video:\u00a0Mountain Man's Amelia Randall Meath,\u00a0Molly Sarl\u00e9\u00a0and\u00a0Alexandra Sauser-Monnig, percussionist Matthew McCaughan from\u00a0Bon Iver... you even get full attendance from\u00a0Sylvan Esso, given that Meath is seated alongside her partner Nick Sanborn. (He doesn't play in the set, but he did co-produce Flock of Dimes' latest album, so Wasner asked him to sit in and bring a book to read.)\n\nThe result is a communal set \u2014 filmed at Sylvan Esso's new studio in Durham, N.C., called Betty's \u2014 that doesn't merely re-create three of the songs from this year's\u00a0Head of Roses. These acoustic performances actually shed new light, thanks to radiant and radically different arrangements, while fully capturing the warmth we look for from Tiny Desk concerts. (Plus, with nine people in the frame, it's a cast large enough that when they clap between songs, they almost sound like a crowd.)\n\nSET LIST\n* \"Two\"\n* \"Price Of Blue\"\n* \"Awake For The Sunrise\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n* Jenn Wasner: vocals, guitar (Flock of Dimes)\n* Amelia Randall Meath: backing vocals (Mountain Man, Sylvan Esso)\n* Alexandra Sauser-Monnig: backing vocals (Mountain Man, Daughter of Swords)\n* Molly Sarl\u00e9: backing vocals (Mountain Man)\n* Joe Westerland: percussion (Megafaun)\n* Matthew McCaughan: percussion (Bon Iver)\n* Alan Good Parker: guitar (Natalie Prass, Matthew E.
