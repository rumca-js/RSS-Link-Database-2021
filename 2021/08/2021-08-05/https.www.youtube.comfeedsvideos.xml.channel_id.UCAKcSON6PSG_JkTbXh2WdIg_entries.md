On Friday, Aug. 6, Eau Claire, Wis., band Them Coulee Boys will release "Namesake," their fourth full-length album to date. The album was written and recorded during the time of pandemic-related shutdowns.

Prior to 2020, Them Coulee Boys were riding high on the national attention they were building, and they were touring in support of their 2019 album, "Die Happy." While on that tour, they stopped at The Current to record a session for Radio Heartland. Watch Them Coulee Boys performing three songs from that 2019 session.

Two years ago this week, IDLES performed a concert at First Avenue in Minneapolis in support of their 2018 album, "Joy As An Act of Resistance," which took the U.S. by storm. Throughout the show, IDLES shared their powerful punk message of love and acceptance. The enthusiastic crowd continued to ignite the band, and as the show neared its end, frontman Joe Talbot told the First Avenue audience, "I'm going to remember this night for the rest of my life."

The Current provided a live video stream of the entire concert; watch three songs from that concert in the video above (and find the entire show in the link below).

Please note this video contains flashing lights and frequent strobe effects.
