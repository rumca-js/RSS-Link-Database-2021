(20% of population in needy countries)

Effects of behaviour on hospital admissions

Prof Mike Tildesley, University of Warwick

Does not expect a significant resurgence unless there is a new variant

but given the success of the vaccination programme I think we can be pretty confident

During a bad flu season, more than 100 deaths and 1,000 hospital admissions every day

Fears for this next flu season

Young adults hospitalised

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-58095503

Amanda Pritchard, NHS chief executive

One in five, between 18 and 34

About 1,000 young adults were currently really unwell in hospital

Level of young adults admissions, four times higher than last winter, (5.5%)

NHS was still experiencing real pressure

Strong vaccine advocacy

NHS teams are putting on pop-up clinics and walk-in centres in addition to around 1,600 permanent sites, to make it as easy as possible to protect yourself, your family and your friends

Throughout the pandemic and compares to previous years.

Restrictions led to changes in the availability of alcohol, 31-week closure of premises

1.2% less than the year before the pandemic

Wine up 8.9%

Cider, down 16.7%

Beer, down 14%

Heaviest buying quintile accounted for 42% of the total increase
