In honor of the new image released by Amazon's Lord of the Rings on Prime, we are covering The Two Trees of Valinor and how they directly connect to the White Trees of Gondor. We trace the line of the trees - from Laurelin and Telperion, to Galathilion in Tirion, to Nimloth of Numenor, to the White Tree of Gondor.
