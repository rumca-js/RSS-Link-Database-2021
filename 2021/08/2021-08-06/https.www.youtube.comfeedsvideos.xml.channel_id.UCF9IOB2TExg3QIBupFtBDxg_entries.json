positive\n\nData from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed\n\nFindings, Children aged 5\u201317 \n\nMarch 24, 2020

a calculable illness duration\n\nThe most common symptoms\n\nHeadache 1,079 (62\u00b72%) of 1734 children\n\nFatigue 954 (55\u00b70%) of 1734 children)\n\nMedian illness duration \n\nChildren testing positive, 6 days \n\nChildren testing negative, 3 days \n\nIllness duration associated with age\n\n(Spearman's rank-order rs 0\u00b719, p less than 0\u00b70001)\n\nMedian illness duration was longer
