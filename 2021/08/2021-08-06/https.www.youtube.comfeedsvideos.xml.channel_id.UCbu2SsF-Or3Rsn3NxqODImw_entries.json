Join Persia as she breaks down bots, limited-time 4v4 Slayer PvP, guns, and important things you should know so far. For starters, there are a bunch of quality of life changes to the gameplay and the way you will interact with the map. There is a revamped mini-map that may give some veteran Halo players pause, as the mini-map behaves differently than in previous games. There is also a new ping system allowing you to mark buildings, place waypoints, and target opponents. Your teammates will even have their Spartans make automatic AI callouts so you can still be in the know without actually needing to hop on comms! \n\nThe tech preview had 3 maps, and we go into detail on what those maps looked like as well as how they were set up. Maps will have random power weapons that rotate with each match, so there is extra variety keeping the rotation fresh as you replay certain maps. Abilities are also back with franchise staples like the Overshield, but plenty of new abilities make their debut too! The drop shield is an interesting utility allowing you to give yourself some advantageous cover for firefights temporarily. Meanwhile, the grapple hook is a game-changer letting you quickly traverse the terrain despite its limited use. \n\nLastly, we go deep into a few of the many weapons at your disposal, including all-new weapons like the Commando tactical rifle, and the Skewer. Be sure to let us know in the comments which weapons you\u2019re most excited to get your hands on! Halo Infinite is slated for a Holiday 2021 release for Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.
