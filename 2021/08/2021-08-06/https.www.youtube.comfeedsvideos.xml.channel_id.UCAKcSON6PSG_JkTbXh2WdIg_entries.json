Still a teenager at the time, Bugg's career took off at an incredible pace; his first full-length debuted at No. 1 in the U.K. album charts, and Bugg subsequently embarked on a U.S. tour, opening for none other than Noel Gallagher. In January of 2014, Bugg returned to The Current to perform before an audience in the Forum at Minnesota Public Radio \u2014 still a month shy of his 20th birthday. The performances in this video compilation are from those sessions at The Current in 2013 and 2014.\n\nFlash-forward to today, and Jake Bugg's next album, \"Saturday Night, Sunday Morning,\" is set for release on August 20, 2021.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Lightning Bolt\" (video in black and white at artists's request)\n2:15 \"Slumville Sunrise\"\n5:02 \"Me and You\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nJake Bugg \u2013 guitar and vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Erik Stromstad\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; Lindsay Kimball\n\nFIND MORE:\n2013 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/08/06/jake-bugg-live\n2014 Guitar Collection interview:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/08/09/the_currents_guitar_collection_jake_bugg\n2014 Forum session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/01/28/jake-bugg-performs-live-in-the-ubs-forum\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thecurrent #jakebugg", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgY8wBRY7lM", "date_published": "2021-08-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Them Coulee Boys - three songs in The Current studio (2019)", "description": "On Friday, Aug. 6, Eau Claire, Wis., band Them Coulee Boys will release \"Namesake,\" their fourth full-length album to date.
