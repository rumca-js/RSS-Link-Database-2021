New COVID-19 Cases and Hospitalizations Among Adults, by Vaccination Status — New York, May 3–July 25, 2021

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e1.htm?s_cid=mm7034e1_w

New study from New York

First to assess vaccine protection against coronavirus infection in delta times

Data for New York May 3 to July 25

N = 10.5 million

Modest drop in vaccine effectiveness against lab confirmed infection

May 3, 91.7%

July 25, 79.8%

But

Age adjusted effectiveness against hospitalizations

May 3, 91.9% to 95.3%

July 25, 91.9% to 95.3%

Factors

Delta up from 2% to 80%

Widespread relaxations

Implications

Currently authorized vaccines have high effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization, 

but effectiveness against new cases appears to have declined in recent months

these findings support the implementation of a layered approach centered on vaccination, as well as other prevention strategies

Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Nursing Home Residents Before and During Widespread Circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant — National Healthcare Safety Network, March 1–August 1, 2021

N = 85,593 weekly reports

mRNA vaccines

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e3.htm?s_cid=mm7034e3_w

Effectiveness against infection declined in nursing homes as delta increased

March, 75%

June, 53%

Vaccination for visitors and staff is crucial,

additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine might be considered for nursing home and long-term care facility residents

Sustained Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines Against COVID-19 Associated Hospitalizations Among Adults — United States, March–July 2021
N = 1,129 diagnosed patients

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e2.htm?s_cid=mm7034e2_w

Analysis of patients at 21 hospitals

After 2 doses of mRNA vaccine

Across 18 states

Substantial protection against hospitalizations

No decline in protection against hospitalization over 24 weeks

Effectiveness was steady at 86% percent

Immunocompetent adults, 90% protection

Remained constant during delta surge

At 2 to 12 weeks after second dose, 86%

At 13 to 24 weeks after second dose, 84%

CDC director Rochelle Walensky

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/18/covid-vaccine-effectiveness/

Examining numerous cohorts through the end of July and early August, three points are now very clear

First, vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection begins to decrease over time. 

Second, vaccine effectiveness against severe disease, hospitalization and death remains relatively high. 

And third, vaccine effectiveness is generally decreased against the delta variant

Impact of Delta on viral burden and vaccine effectiveness against new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the UK

https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/files/coronavirus/covid-19-infection-survey/finalfinalcombinedve20210816.pdf

N = 384,543

Households, 221,909

Obtaining two vaccine doses remains the most effective way to ensure protection against Delta 

With Delta, Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines still offer good protection against new infections

but effectiveness is reduced compared with Alpha

However, Delta infections after two vaccine doses had similar peak levels of virus to those in unvaccinated people

(with the Alpha variant, peak virus levels in those infected post-vaccination were much lower)

Two doses of either vaccine still provided at least the same level of protection as having had COVID-19 through natural infection

People who had been vaccinated after already being infected with COVID-19 had even more protection than vaccinated individuals who had not had COVID-19 before

Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech have greater initial effectiveness against new COVID-19 infections

but this declines faster compared with two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca

After four to five months, effectiveness of these two vaccines similar

however, long-term effects need to be studied

The time between doses does not affect effectiveness in preventing new infections

Younger people have even more protection from vaccination than older people

UK, third shots

Prof Peter Openshaw

New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG

We can't just look at the antibody levels and think that that equates to levels of protection

It still seems that you get a lot of protection from these vaccines, even if the antibody levels have drifted down to some sort of stable level
