relaxations\n\nImplications\n\nCurrently authorized vaccines have high effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization, \n\nbut effectiveness against new cases appears to have declined in recent months\n\nthese findings support the implementation of a layered approach centered on vaccination, as well as other prevention strategies\n\nEffectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Nursing Home Residents Before and During Widespread Circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant \u2014 National Healthcare Safety Network, March

clear\n\nFirst, vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection begins to decrease over time. \n\nSecond, vaccine effectiveness against severe disease, hospitalization and death remains relatively high. \n\nAnd third, vaccine effectiveness is generally decreased against the delta variant", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRj3wygulc", "date_published": "2021-08-19

offer good protection against new infections\n\nbut effectiveness is reduced compared with Alpha\n\nHowever, Delta infections after two vaccine doses had similar peak levels of virus to those in unvaccinated people\n\n(with the Alpha variant, peak virus levels in those infected post-vaccination were much lower)\n\nTwo doses of either vaccine still provided at least the same level of protection as having had COVID-19 through natural infection\n\nPeople who had been vaccinated after already being infected with COVID-19 had even more protection than vaccinated individuals who had not had COVID-19 before\n\nTwo doses of Pfizer-BioNTech have greater initial effectiveness against new COVID-19 infections\n\nbut this declines faster compared with two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca\n\nAfter four to five months, effectiveness of these two vaccines similar\n\nhowever, long-term effects need to be studied\n\nThe time between doses does not affect effectiveness in preventing new infections\n\nYounger people have even more protection from vaccination than older people\n\nUK, third shots\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-58266043\n\nProf Peter Openshaw\n\nNew and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG\n\nWe can't just look at the antibody levels and think that that equates to levels of protection\n\nIt still seems that you get a lot of protection from these vaccines, even if the antibody levels have drifted down to some sort of stable level", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsq9C-p7rwU", "date_published": "2021-08-19
