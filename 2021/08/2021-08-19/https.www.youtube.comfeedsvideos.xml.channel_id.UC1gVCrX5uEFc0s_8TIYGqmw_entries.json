Detonated on March 1, 1954, the device was the most powerful nuclear device detonated by the United States and its first lithium deuteride fueled thermonuclear weapon. Castle Bravo's yield was 15 megatons of TNT, 2.5 times the predicted 6.0 megatons, due to unforeseen additional reactions involving lithium-7, which led to the unexpected radioactive contamination of areas to the east of Bikini Atoll. At the time, it was the most powerful artificial explosion in history.\n\nWikipedia:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Bravo\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.

Detonation of the associated nuclear weapon occurred 19 seconds after its deployment at 8:30am PDT (1530 UTC) on May 25, 1953, in Area 5 of the Nevada Test Site. The codename Grable was chosen because the letter Grable is phonetic for G, as in \"gun\", since the warhead was a gun-type fission weapon. As a shell, or artillery-fired atomic projectile (AFAP), the device was the first of its kind. The test remains the only nuclear artillery shell ever actually fired in the U.S. nuclear weapons test program.\n\nWikipedia:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upshot-Knothole_Grable\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
