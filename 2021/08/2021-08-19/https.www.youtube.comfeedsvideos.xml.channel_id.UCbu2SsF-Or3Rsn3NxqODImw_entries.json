The video is recorded real-time in Unreal 5 Engine, and supported by NVIDIA DLSS technology. \n\nBlack Myth: Wukong is an upcoming action role-playing game by Chinese indie developer Game Science, based on the classical 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West. Game Science hopes to release the game in 2023.\n\n#blackmythwukong #blackmyth #wukong", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T-YPdyttM", "date_published": "2021-08-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut | Japanese Lip Sync Comparison", "description": "The PS5 version of Ghost of Tsushima now features proper Japanese lip sync. But how does it compare to the original PS4 version?\n\nA point of contention for some players during the release of Ghost of Tsushima was the lack of lip sync when playing with Japanese audio. Considering the game\u2019s setting and how playing it in Japanese is featured as a selling point when you start the game, this exclusion did hurt those looking to experience the game this way.\n\nThis is because the original PS4 release of Ghost of Tsushima used pre-rendered cutscenes, which were so big, they could barely fit on the game disc. This didn\u2019t leave the space for alternate cutscenes with different lip sync. In the PS5 version, The Director's Cut, the cutscenes rendered are in real-time. This allows room for Sucker Punch to add in Japanese lip sync.\n\nAs someone who played Ghost of Tsushima in Japanese this is by far my favorite new addition, it\u2019s still not perfect in a few spots but it\u2019s a massive improvement. Playing in Japanese, you don\u2019t find yourself distracted by the lip sync the way you might have been previously. Watch this video for yourself to see the differences between the two versions.\n\n#ghostoftsushima", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jszehvdyGEQ", "date_published": "2021-08-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Halo Infinite Development Update (August)", "description": "Join members of the 343 Industries team for a discussion on key takeaways from the recent Multiplayer Technical Preview, updates on Halo Infinite\u2019s overall development, and what to expect at launch.  \n\nSome key updates included campaign co-op and Forge getting delayed to post-launch, with the former tentatively arriving around three months after launch and the latter coming six months after launch.

This includes the look and feel of the environments running on the MW engine, as well as what you can expect for campaign, zombies mode, multiplayer. \n\nWith Call of Duty Vanguard officially announced, GameSpot was able to check out a hands-off, digital event with loads of information about this year's Call of Duty title. Unfortunately, GameSpot wasn't able to capture footage or gameplay of the event, so this video will mostly feature captured footage and assets from previous Call of Duty games. \n\nCall of Duty Vanguard will be set in World War II but will not have ties to 2017's \"WWII\" story line. It'll feature a new story surrounding four allied soldiers across the globe, who eventually team up at the tail end of the second World War. The game will run on an updated version of the Modern Warfare engine and will feature new and returning modes and ways to play. A new mode that was discussed was \"Battle Hill\"- a mix of battle royal and gunfight modes. Zombies return with production led by Treyarch studios, and plans for an expansive origin story to Cold War's Zombies mode. Not much was mentioned in regards to multiplayer, but a separate even was announced for another time. Call of Duty Vanguard releases on November 5th 2021.\n\nAs more news surfaces about Call of Duty Vanguard, stick with GameSpot for the latest coverage, including dates for alpha and beta tests, trailers and more.
