Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nLaTesha Harris | August 25, 2021\nBy the time Quavo hits the second half of his opening verse on \"Avalanche,\" all three members of\u00a0Migos\u00a0are vibrating with energy, falling out of their seats to ride the beat. Juvenile delight fills the air, and it feels like a competition of who can vibe the hardest. Migos performs the remainder of their Tiny Desk (home) concert \u2014 \"Straightenin\" and \"Birthday\" \u2014 with Offset leaping around the trendy streetwear spot Gallery Dept., Quavo bouncing on armchairs and Takeoff working the shoulder.\n\nTheir performance showcases why we first fell in love with the Atlanta trap trio: charismatic synchronization, playful braggadocio and, of course, their exhilarating resurrection of the triplet flow. In 2013, Migos released the breakout single \"Versace\" before grinding their way up to 2015's\u00a0Yung Rich Nation. In 2017, Migos firmly pulled everyone and their mama into their orbit;\u00a0Culture, especially its inescapable lead single, \"Bad and Boujee,\" laid the foundation for contemporary rap's reckoning.\u00a0Culture II\u00a0dropped a year later, and the trilogy concluded with\u00a0Culture III, released this past June. Legendary producer collective 1500 or Nothin' bring the best part of the new album to life in this long-waited Tiny Desk, as Larrance \"Rance\" Dopson, Lamar \"My Guy Mars\" Edwards, Quintin \"Q\" Gulledge and Chris Payton \u2014 as well as Migos mainstay DJ Durel \u2014 deliver chest-thudding support.\n\n\"You rockin' with the greatest group of all time,\" Quavo announces toward the end of their performance and, as the surreal party plays out, it's tempting to agree. Simply put: They ate and left no crumbs.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Avalanche\"\n \u2022 \"Straightenin\"\n \u2022 \"Birthday\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Quavo: vocals\n \u2022 Takeoff: vocals\n \u2022 Offset: vocals\n \u2022 Larrance \"Rance\" Dopson: percussion\n \u2022 Lamar \"My Guy Mars\" Edwards: keys\n \u2022 Dammo \"The Great\" Farmer: bass, key bass\n \u2022 Quintin \"Q\" Gulledge: drums\n \u2022 Chris Payton : guitar\n \u2022 DJ Durel: DJ\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Michael D.
