On The Babylon Bee Interview Show, Kyle and Ethan talk to stand-up comedian Nazareth. They talk about performing on Zoom, finding Jesus, and being Middle Eastern. Nazareth has been a stand-up for over 25 years. He started his comedy career working with the likes of Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, and Kevin James. Once he found Jesus, Nazareth committed his life to Christ and quickly became one of the top Christian comedians in the country. He has written a book entitled Hope in 24 Hours. Check out his website Nazarethusa.com  for when he will be performing near you. 

Nazareth offers his email address if anyone wants to ask any questions about coming to Jesus: Naz@nazarethusa.com
