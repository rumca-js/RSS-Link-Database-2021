Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news. Today we revisit the big FTC antitrust lawsuit against Facebook as its been amended and there's a lot more meat on the bones. There are a lot of questions at hand, what happens if Facebook is actually broken up and how does that affect VR? Also new full body tracking is on its way and V32 Quest update as well as a bunch more.
