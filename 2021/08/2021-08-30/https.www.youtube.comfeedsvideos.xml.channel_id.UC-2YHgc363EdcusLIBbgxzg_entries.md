NEOM is Saudi Arabia's tentpole project in their Vision 2030 initiative to help move the Kingdom away from an oil-based economy and rely more on technology and tourism. It has some ambitious goals, like being 100% sustainable, moving all transport underground, and even glowing beaches. But the most noticeable thing about the project is the fact that the city will lie on a 100-mile line serviced by a hyperloop-style high speed train system.

But is it all it's cracked up to be? Let's take a look.
