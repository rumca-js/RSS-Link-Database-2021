<p>Back in the not-quite-as-bad-old-days (at least as far back as the
90's), every good website had a small &quot;ad&quot; gif that fans of the site
could use as a colorful link. These are called &quot;buttons&quot; or sometimes
&quot;pins.&quot;</p>
<p>You can see sites that collect these internet artifacts (both the good
ones and boring ones)
<a href="https://anlucas.neocities.org/88x31Buttons.html">here</a> and
<a href="http://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Most people would have <strong>dozens</strong> of these at the bottom of their site,
linking to all their favorite sites, back when people actually linked to
things because search engines hadn't taken over the internet.</p>
<p>The only rules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has to be 88 by 31 pixels.</li>
<li>It has to be a .gif.</li>
<li>And it <em>should</em> be animated, colorful or memorable (but some people
do the gray ones to be ironic or boring).</li>
</ol>
<p>Since we're all trying to Reject the Modernity of the current internet,
I figure I should do my part to bring these back.</p>
<p>I made a little button for LARBS, which you can see here:</p>
<p><img alt="LARBS" src="https://larbs.xyz/pix/larbs.gif" /></p>
<p>Nice, simple, noticeable and memorable. Best of all, at 88x31, it's
very small. Adding dozens of these to your site is a great way to link
creatively without using more than 90's bandwidth. After I get a good
collection of them, I might link my favorite sites with them.</p>
<p>So I encourage you to make some of these for sites you like. You're
even welcome to make some for my sites:
<a href="https://landchad.net">LandChad.net</a>, <a href="https://notrelated.xyz">Not
Related</a>, heck, even
<a href="https://based.cooking">Based.Cooking</a>, or even my personal website for
that matter.</p>
<p>I might talk about these things in a video later because it's one of
those aethetical niceities that has been lost to time.</p>
<p>(PS: GIMP can make gifs, look it up, and remember to &quot;Optimize for
gifs&quot; after you're almost done to make the filesize super low.)</p>
