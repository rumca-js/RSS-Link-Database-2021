Our assessment is that such patients were probably predisposed to diabetes because of obesity and family history

Severe diabetes caused by pancreatic damage, less common

Proportion of newly diagnosed diabetes in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis

https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.14269

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/01/covid-new-onset-diabetes/

Meta-analysis, 8 studies, n = 3,700 patients

14.4% for newly diagnosed diabetes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients

newly diagnosed diabetes may confer a greater risk for poor prognosis

We are now seeing a classic example of a lethal intersection between a communicable and a non-communicable disease.

Physiology

Stress response associated with severe illness

Treatment with glucocorticoids

Diabetogenic effect of COVID-19 should also be considered

High degree of insulin resistance

High insulin requirements in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients with diabetes

More diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic in COVID-19 patients with diabetes

SARS-CoV-2), attaching to ACE2 receptors in beta cells

May also injure beta cells by pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6)

Enhancing autoimmunity in genetically predisposed people

ACE2 receptors are expressed in the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle

May impair responses to insulin

47,000 people in England, admitted to hospital for coronavirus before August 2020

Seven months after discharged

5% of people went on to develop diabetes

Hospitalised patients, 1.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes after discharge

Matched with non- hospitalised people of the same age and background
