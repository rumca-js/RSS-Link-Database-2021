The Exodus Short Film Trailer introduces a new engineer Specialist Irish who can deploy cover and grenade interceptors as well as sets up what looks like a Season 1 fight over a downed secret weapon on the Hourglass map.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 seems like it will tell a gripping story despite not having a single-player campaign. The Exodus Short Film Trailer revealed a lot about how Specialists\u2019 struggles will be revealed through the different seasons and what kind of scenarios players will be thrown into through the multiplayer All-Out Warfare mode.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to go over details from the trailer. The story so far includes two returning Battlefield 4 characters, Irish and Pakowski. There\u2019s a larger conflict brewing between the United States and Russia and also a much more personal conflict between No-Pats--people who've been driven from their home countries by natural disasters and political turmoil. The story sets up a conflict between Irish and Oz: Irish is a former US Marine who has broken away to save his family and wants acceptance for the refugees under his watch, while Oz is a shadowy figure who wants to start a war between superpowers by uncovering state secrets. The trailer ends by setting up a scenario on the Hourglass map, where players seem to be able to fight for one side or the other over a crashed prototype weapon.\n\u00a0\nIn this video, we will also break down the new Specialist. Irish is an Engineer Class. His unique equipment allows him to build a Fortification System called DCS deployable cover. He can also deploy a device to shoot down explosives called the APS-36. His Trait is Veteran, which gives him extra armor.\n\nDICE is currently running a Battlefield 2042 technical alpha test, with open betas coming in September and the game's full release in October.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ccs-YYXA-vQ", "date_published": "2021-08-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Diablo 2 Resurrected Paladin Livestream (Early Access Beta)", "description": "The early access beta for Diablo II Resurrected is starting on August 13th and with this beta we get to try our hands at multiplayer, the Paladin, Druid and more.\n\nFollowing the Early Access weekend, on August 20 at 10:00 a.m. PDT, the Open Beta weekend will be open to everyone on a supported platform.\n\n#diablo2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34DkLgrijNY", "date_published": "2021-08-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Naraka Bladepoint - 11 Minutes of Gameplay", "description": "Here's a quick look at Naraka: Bladepoint before you jump into the fray. \n\nNaraka: Bladepoint is a 60-player action battle royale game with a variety of melee, ranged weapons, abilities, and unique movement options.

In an age where the competitive shooter space is highly crowded, and indie shooters don\u2019t really make much of an impression, this is impressive to say the least.
