In this episode of the Bee Weekly, Kyle and Ethan are joined by apologist Dr. Frank Turek (https://twitter.com/DrFrankTurek), founder of CrossExamined (https://crossexamined.org/) and author of several books including Stealing From God and I Don’t Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist. 

They talk about the weird news of the week that they can’t believe is real and ask Frank all the internet’s top questions about God. In the subscriber portion, Frank is subjected to the Next Ten Questions and of course salty hate mail.
