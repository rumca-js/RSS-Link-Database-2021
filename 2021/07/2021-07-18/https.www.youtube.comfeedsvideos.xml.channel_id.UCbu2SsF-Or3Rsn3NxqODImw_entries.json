That's a lot to live up to, but thankfully after 5 hours of hands-on time with the game, the game is shaping up to be an ambitious and mature take on its predecessor, while still honoring what made the first one so special all those years ago.\n\nIn the above video, Kurt Indovina details his time with the preview version, going over its writing, gameplay, and level design. Like the original, it's bursting with studio Double Fine's unhinged creativity, and director Tim Schafer's signature writing and charm.\n\nThe game is expected to release on August 25 for PC, PS4, and will be available day one on Game Pass for Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n#Psychonauts2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL_I_Yhjlso", "date_published": "2021-07-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Tom Clancy's XDEFIANT Announcement Trailer", "description": "Check out the all new Tom Clancy's XDEFIANT Trailer developed by Ubisoft.

Coming later this year, this new cinematic quest will see the Tenno will face off against the growing force of the Sentients, who have now invaded Earth.\nIn this extended gameplay reveal, we see the full invasion of Cestus, Earth's major human settlement, showing off the scale of the Sentient invasion.  But in a surprise twist, we then cut to gameplay for characters other than our familiar Tenno. While your adventures throughout Warframe have focused on the Tenno, The New War will mark the first time players take on an active role as side characters for story missions. In the gameplay we saw during the stream, The New War will feature missions letting you control the sword-wielding Teshin of the Conclave faction, Kahl-175 of the Grineer, and the Corpus engineer Veso. These standalone missions will focus on each character's particular loadout and skills, making them stand apart from the slate of Frames you've become well accustomed to over the years. However, The New War will still focus on the Tenno and their actions during this questline.\n\n#warframe #warframenewwar #tennocon2021", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylV8c3jnbig", "date_published": "2021-07-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
