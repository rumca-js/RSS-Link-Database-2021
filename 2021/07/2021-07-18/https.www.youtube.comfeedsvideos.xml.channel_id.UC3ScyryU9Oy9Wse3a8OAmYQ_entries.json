Pegasus has been used by NSO clients to spy on journalists, human rights activists and others. One target: Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \n\nThe investigation is coordinated by the journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories, with technical support from Amnesty International\u2019s Security Lab.\n\nWashington Post reporter Dana Priest is one of more than 80 journalists from 17 media organizations working on the collaboration, known as \u201cThe Pegasus Project.\u201d She traveled to Turkey to verify if Pegasus had been used to surveil Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz. NSO Group says its spyware is used to fight terrorism and serious crimes, and that its technology was not associated in any way with Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nThis reporting is part of an upcoming FRONTLINE documentary produced with Forbidden Stories to air on PBS.\n\n#PegasusProject #Khashoggi #NSOGroup\n\nFind more from FRONTLINE on the PBS Video App, where there are more than 300 FRONTLINE documentaries available for you to watch any time: https://to.pbs.org/FLVideoApp\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
