LineCheck is a series of virtual conversations with Minnesota's music community, covering topics like the Minnesota music economy, mental health care for creatives, supporting safe music spaces, and activism through music. Because the conversations are centered on music and the music industry, the sessions naturally open and close with music.

Here are two songs performed by Charlie Parr for LineCheck episode 1, "Minnesota's Music Ecosystem." Parr recorded the songs live at the Sacred Heart Music Center in Duluth, Minnesota. Both songs appear on Charlie Parr's forthcoming album, "Last of the Better Days Ahead," out July 30, 2021, on Smithsonian Folkways.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "817 Oakland Avenue"
5:32 "Last of the Better Days Ahead"
