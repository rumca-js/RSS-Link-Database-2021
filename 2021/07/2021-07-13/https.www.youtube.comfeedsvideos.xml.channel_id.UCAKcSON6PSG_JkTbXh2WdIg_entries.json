Because the conversations are centered on music and the music industry, the sessions naturally open and close with music.\n\nHere are two songs performed by Charlie Parr for LineCheck episode 1, \"Minnesota's Music Ecosystem.\" Parr recorded the songs live at the Sacred Heart Music Center in Duluth, Minnesota. Both songs appear on Charlie Parr's forthcoming album, \"Last of the Better Days Ahead,\" out July 30, 2021, on Smithsonian Folkways.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"817 Oakland Avenue\"\n5:32 \"Last of the Better Days Ahead\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nCharlie Parr \u2013 guitar and vocals\n\nMORE LINECHECK:\nComplete series: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2021/05/18/linecheck-series\n\nFIND MORE CHARLIE PARR:\n2010 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2010/08/06/charlie_parr\n2010 State Fair session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2010/08/31/charlie-parr-mn-state-fair\n2015 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/04/28/charlie-parr-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2015 State Fair session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/08/28/charlie-parr-performs-live-at-the-minnesota-state-fair\n2017 interview with Euan Kerr:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/10/27/on-new-album-charlie-parr-hits-some-sad-notes\n2017 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/11/07/charlie-parr-performs-songs-from-dog-on-the-local-show\n2019 interview with Euan Kerr:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/09/27/charlie-parr-uses-injury-to-reassess-and-recordinterview\n2020 virtual session for Sounds Like Home:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/05/29/charlie-parr-sounds-like-home-live-virtual-session\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thecurrent #charlieparr", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sopP-5GJrzU", "date_published": "2021-07-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Dylan Cartlidge - Virtual Session", "description": "@DylanCartlidgeMusic plays songs from his debut record, 'Hope Above Adversity,' in a virtual session.
