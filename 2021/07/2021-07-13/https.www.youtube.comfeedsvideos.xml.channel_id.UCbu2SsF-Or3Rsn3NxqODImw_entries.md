## Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - Switch vs. Wii Graphics Comparison

With The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD coming to Nintendo Switch, we put it head-to-head with the original Wii version to see the graphical differences.

The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword was originally released for Nintendo Wii in November 2011 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda series. Now, 10 years later, it’s being remastered in HD for the Nintendo Switch. In this game, Link and Zelda are childhood best friends who live on an island in the sky named Skyloft. After evil forces kidnap Zelda and take her to the surface, it’s up to Link to fulfill his destiny as the Goddess' chosen hero and save the world from the evil that wants to control it.

A few things to note about this video: The original version of Skyward Sword is a Wii game, but the footage used in this video is the Wii version running on a Wii U and captured at 1080p, so it’s the original standard definition image quality blown up. The HD version is captured on Switch at 1080p. The Wii version is running at 30fps, while the new HD remaster runs at 60fps, so you’ll notice one is smoother than the other. And lastly, the new Switch version is being played with the newly added button controls

The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD releases for Nintendo Switch on July 16, 2021. Alongside the game, Nintendo is releasing a pair of Joy-Con controllers themed after the Master Sword and Hylian Shield, and a Zelda & Loftwing amiibo figure.
