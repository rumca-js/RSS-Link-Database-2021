19A/19B\n\nSuggesting the potential faster viral replication rate and more infectiousness of the Delta variant at the early stage of the infection. \n\nDisease control measures, including the frequency of population testing, quarantine in pre-symptomatic phase and enhancing the genetic surveillance should be adjusted to account for the increasing prevalence of the Delta variant at global level.\n\nIntra-family transmissions\n\nIncubation period, 2020, 19A/19B strains\n\nExposure to first PCR positive, 6 days (IQR 5.00-8.00) days in the 2020 epidemic\n\nIncubation period, 2021\n\n4
