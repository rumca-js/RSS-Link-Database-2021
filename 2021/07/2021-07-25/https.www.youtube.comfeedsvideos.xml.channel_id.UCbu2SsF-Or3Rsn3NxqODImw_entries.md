Apex Legends Season 10 kicks off in August, introducing a ton of new content for its battle royale and Arenas modes.

Apex Legends Emergence is right around the corner. Season 10 of Respawn's battle royale introduces Seer as a new playable legend, makes substantial changes to World's Edge, and implements major balancing changes to several weapons and characters. Caustic mains, rejoice! Emergence gives y'all a nice buff.

That includes the lore and abilities for Seer, the three maps coming to Arenas, the new Rampage LMG, and the return of Disruptor Ammo. That's right--the bane of Season 2 has finally returned.
