Today, we cover the most famous bows and arrows in Middle-earth!  From the legendary bows of Beleg and Bregor in the First Age, to the Bow of the Galadhrim given to Legolas, to the black arrow that took down Smaug.  From the horseback archers of Rohan, to the legendary arrows of the Númenóreans that went forth as a cloud and were the most feared in all the Second Age.  We highlight all the great bows and arrows among elves, men, and dwarves!
