young\n\nhttps://coronavirus.data.gov.uk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYTyi2pFXxk&t=346s\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01589-0/fulltext\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01589-0/attachment/59e7c37f-2dbb-498e-a092-fc5be732603b/mmc1.pdf\n\nImplicit in this decision is the acceptance that infections will surge\n\nbroken the link between infection and mortality\n\nOn July 19, 2021, almost all restrictions are set to end. \n\nWe believe this decision is dangerous and premature.\n\nProportionate mitigations will be needed to avoid hundreds of thousands of new infections, until many more are vaccinated. \n\nimmunity will be achieved by vaccination for some people but by natural infection for others (predominantly the young). \n\ninfection can still cause substantial morbidity in both acute and long-term illness. \n\nFive main concerns about unmitigated transmission \n\nFirst, Disproportionately affect unvaccinated children and young people\n\n17 million people with no protection against COVID-19\n\nExponential growth will probably continue until millions more people are infected\n\nLeaving hundreds of thousands of people with long-term illness and disability\n\nRisks creating a generation left with chronic health problems and disability\n\nSecond, transmission in schools will lead to educational disruption\n\nStrict mitigations in schools and eventual vaccination of children\n\nMore important for clinically and socially vulnerable children\n\nThird, emergence of vaccine-resistant variants\n\nSpread of potentially more transmissible escape variants\n\nFourth, a significant impact on health services and exhausted health-care staff \n\nLink between cases and hospital admissions has not been broken\n\nRising case numbers will inevitably lead to increased hospital admissions\n\nMillions of people are waiting for medical procedures and routine care\n\nFifth, deprived communities are more exposed\n\nDisproportionately affect the most vulnerable and marginalised\n\nIn light of these grave risks\n\nGiven that vaccination offers the prospect of quickly reaching the same goal of population immunity\n\nwe consider any strategy that tolerates high levels of infection to be both unethical and illogical\n\nThe UK Government must reconsider its current strategy and take urgent steps to protect the public, including children. \n\nWe believe the government is embarking on a dangerous and unethical experiment, and we call on it to pause plans to abandon mitigations on July 19, 2021.\n\nInstead \n\nDelay complete re-opening until everyone, including adolescents, have been offered vaccination and uptake is high\n\nMitigation measures, especially adequate ventilation\n\nCO2 monitors and air filtration devices\n\nSpacing in schools\n\nWith\n\nUniversal mask wearing in indoor spaces, even for those vaccinated\n\nThis will ensure that everyone is protected and make it much less likely that we will need further restrictions or lockdowns in the autumn.", "link":
