Matrix is probably a little easier to use, but XMPP is realistically a better standard for reasons I explain here.\n\nRegardless, Matrix and XMPP are massive improvements over Telegram, Whatsapp, Signal, traditional SMS/text and email. The are free, open-source and decentralized software which can be self-hosted, and offer real and well-vetted E2E (end-to-end) encryption.\n\nI had done a write-up of this on my website too, if you prefer:\nhttps://lukesmith.xyz/articles/matrix-vs-xmpp.html\n\nMy website: https://lukesmith.xyz\nGet all my videos off YouTube: https://videos.lukesmith.xyz\nor Odysee: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@Luke:7\n\nPlease donate: https://donate.lukesmith.xyz\n\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkwXtWtVj3w", "date_published": "2021-07-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
