Mary Lucia talks about the Netflix Original documentary, "Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics," a film that explores the use of hallucinogens through the experiences of those who have experimented with them.

"Have a Good Trip" is an amusing film that talks to various actors and comedians and musicians about their trips on acid and mushrooms and psychedelics — lots of different people like Sarah Silverman, A$AP Rocky, Rob Corddry, Ad Rock, Anthony Bourdain, Sting, Reggie Watts, Jim James, Deepak Chopra, Ben Stiller and many others. "It's not groundbreaking; it's not going to blow your mind," Mary says. "But there's some cool animation because they have to give you sort of the the animated version of what it's like to trip."

"Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics" is written and directed by Donick Cary, and it's streaming now on Netflix.

LineCheck is a series of virtual conversations with Minnesota's music community, and because the conversations are centered on music and the music industry, the sessions naturally open and close with music.

Here are two songs by Sounds of Blackness, recorded specially for LineCheck episode 4, "Minnesota's Music Activists." Representing Sounds of Blackness with two of the group's recent singles are vocalists Melissa Belfrey and Lacey Dreamz. Belfrey and Dreams provide lead vocals on "Sick & Tired," a song inspired by the words of Civil Rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, and "Time for Reparations," Sounds of Blackness's latest single. "Protest music has always been a part of Sounds of Blackness repertoire," says music director Gary Hines. "It is currently and always will be."

SONGS PERFORMED
