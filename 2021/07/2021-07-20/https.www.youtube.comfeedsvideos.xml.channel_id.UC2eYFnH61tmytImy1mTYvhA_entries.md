Matrix and XMPP are the two (only) actually good, end-to-end encrypted and secure messaging software standards. Matrix is probably a little easier to use, but XMPP is realistically a better standard for reasons I explain here.

Regardless, Matrix and XMPP are massive improvements over Telegram, Whatsapp, Signal, traditional SMS/text and email. The are free, open-source and decentralized software which can be self-hosted, and offer real and well-vetted E2E (end-to-end) encryption.
