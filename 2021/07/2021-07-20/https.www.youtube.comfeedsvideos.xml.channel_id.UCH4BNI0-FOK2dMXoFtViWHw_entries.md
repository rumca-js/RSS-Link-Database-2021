Seemingly distant ecosystems, even half a world apart, are connected in surprising ways. In this special limited series, Emily Graslie and Trace Dominguez join me as we explore the universal rules of life that tie together Earth’s living systems. In episode 2, we study the complex family relationships of elephants in Africa’s Serengeti plains and how their shared knowledge can help them survive. Then we travel to San Francisco to discover how the intricate songs of birds have changed in the face of our own culture. How common is culture in the animal kingdom? And what role does it play in the survival of species?
