This is Ross Ulbriet, he’s the founder of the Silk Road. The first online marketplace on the darkweb where you could buy and sell anything. The site went so viral that by age 28, Ross was on track to become a billionaire within just two years.


Ross Ulbricht grew up in Austin, Texas in the late 80s and 90s. His father taught Ross how to think through every side of an argument. And his mother gave up her dream of becoming a journalist to bet everything on her golden son becoming successful.

Ross became obsessed with Libertarianism. And at one school debate, Ross argued that drugs - all drugs should be legalized. That not only is it not the government’s right to tell people what they can and can’t put in their bodies, and that legalizing drugs would actually make society safer. Ross won that debate.

Ross seemingly tried everything. He started a video game company, an investment fund, did odd jobs on Craigslist, but nothing was working. But then an idea struck him: an anonymous website where you can buy and sell anything.

And by 2009, the anonymous browser, Tor, was already a thing, and the last missing piece of technology Ross would need was released: Bitcoin

Ross started working on what would become the Silk Road. It was basically the equivalent of building eBay or Amazon on your own, without any knowledge, experience, or funding. But little by little, the site came together. Being that the Silk Road would end up generating him around $80m in fees, this original $17,000 investment would give him a staggering half-a-million-percent ROI.

It’s been around half a year since Ross first started working on the Silk Road, and today, it was finally time for opening day. Ross had essentially done the work of a 12 person startup.
