Battlefield 2042 is bringing some of the biggest maps in Battlefield history. In this video, we take a look back at the 12 largest Battlefield locations of all time, like Dragon Valley from Battlefield 2, Bandar Desert from the Armored Kill DLC, and even the Halvoy battle royale map.

Battlefield has a rich variety of multiplayer maps from its humble beginnings in Battlefield 1942, all the way to the massive Firestorm battle royale map in Battlefield V. DICE senior designer Niklas Åstrand put out a chart on Twitter that listed every Battlefield map in existence ranked by their size. In this video, we’re breaking down the top 12 largest Battlefield maps of all time.

Surprisingly, one game stands out among the series and appears on the top 12 list more often than the others: Battlefield 2 comes roaring in with five maps, whereas games like Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 each only have one map, such as Bandar Desert, and Golmud Railway!

With Battlefield 2042 reveals coming at EA Play Live on July 22 and a renewed interest in Battlefield 4, we will be covering the series, including the teased Hazard Zone mode and expected alpha and beta dates, so definitely stay tuned!

## The Nintendo Switch OLED Model - Who is it for?

Nintendo has announced the Switch OLED Model and some folk are little confused as to it's intended for. So our very own Kurt Indovina weighs in on the conversation.

While some may have been expecting a Switch Pro with 4K output, others are justifying reasons to upgrade from their current Switch to this OLED Model. However, there's also the consideration that the Switch OLED Model may not be intended for current Switch owners at all.

In the above video, Kurt Indovina takes a step back, and examines where the Nintendo Switch OLED Model exists in the current roster of Switches, as well as measure the value of its $350 price tag. What does it offer that the base model doesn't? Does it make sense if you play primarily docked? And if you're handheld gamer, why not just get the Switch Lite? Join the conversation with Kurt and make sure to leave a comment below.

Learn about what's new, what's leaving, and what you should be playing on Game Pass. This your Game Pass digest for July 7, 2021. 

Game Pass has a lot of games, and twice a month there's more coming, and some leaving. It can be a lot to keep track of, not to mention figuring out what to play from its massive library. That's why we created the Game Pass Show. 

Join Dave Klein to learn what's new, what's leaving, and what you should consider playing. This week, Game Pass sees the arrival of Bloodroots,  UFC 4, Farming Simulator 19, and more. Dave also takes the time to elaborate on his love for Hollow Knight. 

Also, make sure to stick to the end for the pick of the week - a section where Dave hand picks either a hidden gem, or sheds some light on a game you should check out before it leaves Game Pass.
