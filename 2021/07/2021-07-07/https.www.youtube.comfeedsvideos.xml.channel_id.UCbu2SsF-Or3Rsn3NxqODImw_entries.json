DICE senior designer Niklas \u00c5strand put out a chart on Twitter that listed every Battlefield map in existence ranked by their size. In this video, we\u2019re breaking down the top 12 largest Battlefield maps of all time.\n\nSurprisingly, one game stands out among the series and appears on the top 12 list more often than the others: Battlefield 2 comes roaring in with five maps, whereas games like Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 each only have one map, such as Bandar Desert, and Golmud Railway!\n\nWith Battlefield 2042 reveals coming at EA Play Live on July 22 and a renewed interest in Battlefield 4, we will be covering the series, including the teased Hazard Zone mode and expected alpha and beta dates, so definitely stay tuned!\n\n#Battlefield #Battlefield2042", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSbEX5yK84E", "date_published": "2021-07-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "9 Minutes of DEATHLOOP 4K Gameplay Walkthrough", "description": "Deathloop, published by Bethesda, sees players stuck in a time loop battling to survive and perfect their run.

So our very own Kurt Indovina weighs in on the conversation.\n\nWhile some may have been expecting a Switch Pro with 4K output, others are justifying reasons to upgrade from their current Switch to this OLED Model. However, there's also the consideration that the Switch OLED Model may not be intended for current Switch owners at all.\n\nIn the above video, Kurt Indovina takes a step back, and examines where the Nintendo Switch OLED Model exists in the current roster of Switches, as well as measure the value of its $350 price tag. What does it offer that the base model doesn't? Does it make sense if you play primarily docked? And if you're handheld gamer, why not just get the Switch Lite?
