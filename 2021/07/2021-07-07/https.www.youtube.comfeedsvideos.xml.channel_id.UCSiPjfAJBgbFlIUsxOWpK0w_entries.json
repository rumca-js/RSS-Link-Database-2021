This is one of my favorite Joni Mitchell compositions...maybe the first song of hers that I ever heard. She really is an insanely good songwriter.\n\nSave this song on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/2r3Yqkh\nFollow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/pomplamoosemusic\nBecome a patron of our music (to vote on the songs we cover and get merch and stuff like that): http://www.patreon.com/pomplamoose\n\nA cover of Joni Mitchell's \"Big Yellow Taxi\" by Pomplamoose.\n\nMUSICIAN CREDITS\nLead Vocals / Baritone Ukulele: Nataly Dawn\nKeys: Jack Conte\nBass: Nick Campbell\nDrums / Percussion: Kyle Crane\n\nAUDIO CREDITS\nEngineer: Bill Mims\nMixing/Mastering: Caleb Parker\n\nVIDEO CREDITS\nDirector: Dom Fera\nDP / A Cam: Ricky Chavez\nB Cam: Merlin Showalter\nGaffer / Key Grip: Arjay Ancheta\nProduction Designer: Genevieve Parkes\nWardrobe: Elle Olsen\nAssistant / Wardrobe: Alex Allen\nPA: Chris Modl\nVideo Editor / Colorist: Athena Wheaton\n\nRecorded in Los Angeles.\n\n#Pomplamoose #JoniMitchell #BigYellowTaxi\n\nLYRICS\n\nPave paradise, put up a parking lot\nWith a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot\n\nDon't it always seem to go\nThat you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?\nPave paradise, put up a parking lot\nThey pave paradise, put up a parking lot\n\nThey took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum\nAnd they charged all the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em\n\nDon't it always seem to go\nThat you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?\nThey paved paradise, \u200bput up a parking lot\nThey paved paradise, \u200bput up a parking lot\n\nLate last night, I heard the screen door slam\nAnd a big yellow taxi took away my old man\n\nDon't it always seem to go\nThat you don't know what you've got\nDon't it always seem to go\nThat you don't know what you've got\nDon't it always seem to go\nThat you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_r906QqjtY", "date_published": "2021-07-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
