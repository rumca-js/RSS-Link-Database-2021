The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 works great with a 10 GbE NIC. But at what cost?

Well, I tallied it up - here's the gear I bought in the course of making this video:

  - ASUS XG-C100C 10G NIC: https://amzn.to/3AaAwWQ ($93)
  - Mikrotik 5-port 10 Gbps Switch: https://amzn.to/35YaBUx ($139)
  - Mikrotik S+RJ10 Transceiver (x3): https://amzn.to/2UaMG1H ($195)
  - QNAP QSW-M2108-2C 10G/2.5G Switch: https://amzn.to/3hiBGHe ($308)
  - OWC Thunderbolt 3 10G NIC: https://amzn.to/3jlN1Jp ($149)
  - ECHOGEAR 20U Open Frame Rack: https://amzn.to/2Sx0nr5 ($200)
