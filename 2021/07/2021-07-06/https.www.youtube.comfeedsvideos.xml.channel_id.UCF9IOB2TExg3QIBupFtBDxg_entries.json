weeks. \n\nBut for some people, symptoms can last longer.\n\nThe chances of having long-term symptoms does not seem to be linked to how ill you are when you first get COVID-19.\n\nPeople who had mild symptoms at first can still have long-term problems.\n\nCommon long COVID symptoms\n\nextreme tiredness (fatigue)\nshortness of breath\nchest pain or tightness\nproblems with memory and concentration

there\u2019s a lot of Covid at the moment and the rates are going up I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid, particularly in the younger ages where the vaccination rates are currently much lower.\n\nFundamentally the two ways to prevent long Covid in my view are to keep Covid rates right down and make sure everyone is vaccinated so they get very mild disease and I think we really just need to push hell for leather for those two.\n\nThe deaths from Covid I think are mercifully going to be much lower in this wave compared to the previous ones as a proportion of cases but long Covid remains, I think, a worry.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how big an issue it\u2019s going to be but I think we should assume it\u2019s not going to be trivial.\n\nLong covid\n\nN =
