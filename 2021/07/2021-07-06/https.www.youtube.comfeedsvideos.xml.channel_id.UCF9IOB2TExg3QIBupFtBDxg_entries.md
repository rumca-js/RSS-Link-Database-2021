Our fight against this virus is not over

Right now, as I speak to you, millions of Americans are still unvaccinated and unprotected

And because of that, their communities are at risk, their friends are at risk

The people that they care about are at risk

29% percent say they are not likely to get vaccinated

20% definitely not

Democrats, 86% have received at least one dose

Republicans, 45%

Likely to do so

Risks of Long Covid
https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/long-term-effects-of-coronavirus-long-covid/

Many people feel better in a few days or weeks and most will make a full recovery within 12 weeks. 

But for some people, symptoms can last longer.

The chances of having long-term symptoms does not seem to be linked to how ill you are when you first get COVID-19.

People who had mild symptoms at first can still have long-term problems.

Common long COVID symptoms

extreme tiredness (fatigue)
shortness of breath
chest pain or tightness
problems with memory and concentration ("brain fog")
difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
heart palpitations
dizziness
pins and needles
joint pain
depression and anxiety
tinnitus, earache
feeling sick, diarrhoea, stomach aches, loss of appetite
a high temperature, cough, headaches, sore throat, changes to sense of smell or taste
rashes

Chris Whitty on long Covid likely to increase significantly

Since there’s a lot of Covid at the moment and the rates are going up I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid, particularly in the younger ages where the vaccination rates are currently much lower.

Fundamentally the two ways to prevent long Covid in my view are to keep Covid rates right down and make sure everyone is vaccinated so they get very mild disease and I think we really just need to push hell for leather for those two.

The deaths from Covid I think are mercifully going to be much lower in this wave compared to the previous ones as a proportion of cases but long Covid remains, I think, a worry.

We don’t know how big an issue it’s going to be but I think we should assume it’s not going to be trivial.

Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin

Indonesia has, seen a dramatic increase in confirmed cases after the festive holidays

This variant hits everyone -- not only children, but also adults

If we compare with the previous wave, the number of confirmed cases increased significantly faster for both adults and children

We desperately need more vaccines — that’s the bottom line

We hope the international community is listening. 

Without urgent action, many more children and adults will die

Vaccine gap

Professor Anthony Harnden
Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation

The data suggests very strongly that the longer you leave that second dose, the better longer term protection you will have

There is a sort of sweet spot from about eight weeks onwards, and we wouldn't advise anybody to really have the second dose before then

UK, 100,000 cases per day possible

Health Secretary Sajid Javid

makes sense to treat people differently

Self-isolation changes in England

Changes to school bubble system

Prime Minister, 19th July is on

(Scotland, 9th August)

19 July, cases at least double

so around 50,000 new cases a day

As we ease and go into the summer we expect case numbers to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 

Vaccines and treatments are far better than what we had when this pandemic began

UK was now entering uncharted territory

16th August, close contacts of confirmed cases no longer need to self isolate for 10 days if fully vaccinated or under 18s

Positive tests still must self-isolate

Prof Neil Ferguson, Imperial College

UK potential, 150,000 to 200,000 a day

still cause some pressure to the health system

slight gamble

justifiable

I'm reasonably optimistic

The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold

Worst-case scenario there may need to be a course correction later


UK

https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk

Cases, + 24,284 + 27,334 

Hospitalisations, + 358 = 1,905

Cases 10 days ago, 18,271

Proportion of cases hospitalised 10 days later = 1.96%

1st January, 2021, Cases, 61,239

10th January, hospitalisations, 3,933

Proportion of cases hospitalised 10 days later = 6.4%
