How can venue operators make their spaces more inclusive for artists and music fans of all identities?

In the third episode of LineCheck, The Current's virtual conversation series, musician/author Shawna Potter interviewed a batch of event experts: security consultants Kimmy Hull and Shannon Blowtorch (Sequeerity), event organizer Ryan Kroening (Events by Lady K), and producer/community organizer rØ. Each panelist discussed event security and positive, practical steps toward inclusivity.

To open and close the evening, Mayda performed "Mrdr PxP" and "Hurricane" from her album "Mrdr Pxp."
