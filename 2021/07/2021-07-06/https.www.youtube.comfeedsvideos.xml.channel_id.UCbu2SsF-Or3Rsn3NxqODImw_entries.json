This your Game Pass digest for July 7, 2021. \n\nGame Pass has a lot of games, and twice a month there's more coming, and some leaving. It can be a lot to keep track of, not to mention figuring out what to play from its massive library. That's why we created the Game Pass Show. \n\nJoin Dave Klein to learn what's new, what's leaving, and what you should consider playing. This week, Game Pass sees the arrival of Bloodroots,  UFC 4, Farming Simulator 19, and more. Dave also takes the time to elaborate on his love for Hollow Knight. \n\nAlso, make sure to stick to the end for the pick of the week - a section where Dave hand picks either a hidden gem, or sheds some light on a game you should check out before it leaves Game Pass.\n\n#bloodroots #ufc4 #xboxgamepass", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVACyXXrzLY", "date_published": "2021-07-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Nintendo Switch OLED Everything We Know (So Far)", "description": "A new version of the Switch has been announced!
