Sorry, had to reupload this video, its the same as the poorly uploaded previous version. United States, Delta variant, acknowledge the war has changed

Summary, Delta is different from previous strains

Highly contagious

Likely more severe

Breakthrough infections may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases

Vaccines prevent more than 90% of severe disease, but may be less effective at preventing infection or transmission

Therefore, more breakthrough and more community spread despite vaccination

NPIs are essential to prevent continued spread with current vaccine coverage

Vaccine breakthrough cases may reduce public confidence in vaccines

Vaccine breakthrough cases are expected

Will increase as a proportion of total cases as vaccine coverage increases

Vaccine breakthrough cases will occur more frequently in congregate settings

and in groups at risk of primary vaccine failure (i.e., immune compromised, elderly)

Communication challenges have been associated with increasing proportions of cases vaccinated even when vaccine effectiveness (VE) remains stable

Important to update communications describing breakthrough cases as “rare” or as a “small percentage” of cases

35,000 symptomatic infections per week with 162 million vaccinated

December 14, 2020 – April 10, 2021

Vaccine effectiveness against infection, 91% among fully vaccinated; 81% for partially vaccinated

40% lower mean RNA viral load

Shorter mean duration of detectable viral RNA (2.7 v. 8.9 days)

Lower risk of febrile symptoms (25.0% v. 63.1%)

Shorter mean duration of symptoms (10.3 v. 16.7 days)

Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization 88%

No evidence of waning immunity through 20 weeks post-2nd dose

Lower estimates of VE for mRNA vaccines among immunocompromised populations

After 2 doses, 59 - 80% against infection

Vaccines more effective against hospitalization/death  illness  infection

Delta infections associated with higher viral load and duration of shedding

India

Lower cycle threshold (Ct) values in Delta breakthrough cases

HCW, Ct 16.5

Non delta, Ct 19

Delta infection associated with longer duration of Ct values less than 30 18 days vs. 13 days for ancestral strains

Delta variant vaccine breakthrough cases may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases

UK, Cases down a bit today

Includes lateral flow tests
