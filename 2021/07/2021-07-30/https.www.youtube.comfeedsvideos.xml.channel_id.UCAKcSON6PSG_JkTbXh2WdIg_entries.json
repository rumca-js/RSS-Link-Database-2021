It also protects me to know that people will just take what they want from music, they'll just take what they from the writing of my music, so I don't feel as exposed in a way.\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"All Mirrors\"\n4:02 \"Spring\"\n7:19 \"Summer\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nAngel Olsen - vocals, keys, guitar\nNona Marie Invie - backing vocals, synths\nEmily Elkin - cello\nAlex Guy - violin\nEmily Elhaj - bass\nRhys Hastings - drums\nPaul Sukeena \u2013 guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Mary Mathis; Nate Ryan\nAudio: Corey Schreppel; Anna Haverman\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2014 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/05/02/angel-olsen-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2014 Guitar Collection interview:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/05/07/the-currents-guitar-collection-angel-olsen\n2019 album announcement feature: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/07/30/angel-olsen-announces-all-mirrors-shares-title-track\n2019 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/11/12/angel-olsen-performs-songs-from-all-mirrors-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thecurrent #angelolsen", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJbBEbKNC4A", "date_published": "2021-07-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Kathleen Edwards - two songs for The Current (2020)", "description": "One year ago this week, Kathleen Edwards performed a virtual session recorded at home for The Current.
