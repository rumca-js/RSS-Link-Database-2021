Fallout is back again! This time with Fallout 2. I have a feeling people are going to be mad at me this month…

I’ve actually played through Fallout 2 twice now and both times couldn’t get into it. It is a lot more like the modern games in the Fallout series but after making this review I realised that it just has too much text for me. Fallout 2 is also so long that the interface really starts becoming a problem. 

As a reminder my current plan now is to do Fallout 3, Fallout 3 DLC, a secret extra Fallout 3 video, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Fallout 4 VR mods. This will take me years.

I then might do the Metroid series, I plan on doing it, it just depends if I will do it next. In between these videos I have some science and history videos in the works I will likely do: Game video, science video, game video, science, and so on.
