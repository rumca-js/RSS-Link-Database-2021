This time with Fallout 2. I have a feeling people are going to be mad at me this month\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve actually played through Fallout 2 twice now and both times couldn\u2019t get into it. It is a lot more like the modern games in the Fallout series but after making this review I realised that it just has too much text for me. Fallout 2 is also so long that the interface really starts becoming a problem. \n\nAs a reminder my current plan now is to do Fallout 3, Fallout 3 DLC, a secret extra Fallout 3 video, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Fallout 4 VR mods. This will take me years.\n\nPatreon bros: https://www.patreon.com/UpIsNotJump \nMerch-o-bros: https://www.pixelempire.com/pages/upisnotjump\nTwitter-o-fish: https://twitter.com/UpIsNotJump \n\nI then might do the Metroid series, I plan on doing it, it just depends if I will do it next. In between these videos I have some science and history videos in the works I will likely do: Game video, science video, game video, science, and so on. \n\nThumbnail Artwork by Skutch: https://twitter.com/skutchdraws?lang=en\n\nAnimations (the Wompabomb etc.) by Helen Quinlan: https://www.artstation.com/creative_devil\n\nA special thanks to my members!! \nSiberial\nSuperhero3807", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHNchO1XkKw", "date_published": "2021-07-30 21:00:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
