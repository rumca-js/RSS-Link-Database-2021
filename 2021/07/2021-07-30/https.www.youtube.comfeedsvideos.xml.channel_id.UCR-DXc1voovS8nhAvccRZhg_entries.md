After months of testing various PCI Express SATA cards on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, and contributing a Linux kernel patch to Raspberry Pi OS, now everybody can use SATA with Pi OS out of the box—no kernel compile needed!

This makes things great for those of us wanting to build NASes or other higher-performance storage devices with Raspberry Pis.

Thanks to everyone for your interest in the CM4 videos—you gave me the motivation to work on this patch and get the support added to Pi OS, and I'm excited my first bit of code is alive in the Raspberry Pi Linux kernel!
