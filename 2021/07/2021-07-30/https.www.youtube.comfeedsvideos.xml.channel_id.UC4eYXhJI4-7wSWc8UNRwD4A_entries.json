Last spring, Elaine Welteroth and Jonathan Singletary had to give up their plans for a dream wedding. The writer/Project Runway judge/fashion icon and the musician/producer had been planning epic nuptials to celebrate their epic love story (they've known each other as children, then reconnected after many years to discover soulmate-level romance.) But when the pandemic started, their happily-ever-after took a different turn. The royal wedding turned into a DIY front stoop affair at their Brooklyn brownstone, with most guests Zooming in while a lucky few danced in the street to a boombox playing the couple's favorite songs. It was enchanted beyond anyone's wildest dreams.\n\nThe first chapter of this marriage has been beset by menacing outside forces: the global pandemic, racial violence in American streets and insurrection at our nation's Capitol. But Elaine and Jonathan have called on the good spirits of kindness, generosity, devotion, gratitude and courage \u2014 and they have prevailed.\n\nDuring this year of pandemic and isolation, of grief and fear, and of newlywed bliss, Jonathan wrote a love song. \"Never Like This\" is for Elaine, and for their community of friends and family that have gathered together in the shelter of love. In his words, \"It's an ode to the greatest drug known to mankind \u2014 love. It's an homage to classic love, to courageous love, to transcendent love.\"\n\nThis is a conversation about the triumph of love over everything, of good over evil, of joy over despair \u2014 about the power of love to guide us, with intention and purpose, to shape our own stories and find our own happy endings.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FQQgqFeu0k", "date_published": "2021-07-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Shame: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | July 30, 2021\nThe first time I saw shame singer Charlie Steen, he was stripped down to nothing but his Racing Green brand underwear (which he had wedged up his behind), as guitar, bass and drums punctuated his emphatic vocals. In this Tiny Desk (home) concert, we find Charlie in a full suit, tie and hat, sitting in a living room atmosphere backed not only by the rest of shame (also seated), but a compendium of violins, horns and more.\n\nAll the songs here are from the band's 2021 album, Drunk Tank Pink. It's the sound of this South London post-punk band challenging not only their listeners, but themselves. What a thrill.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Snow Day\"\n\"Born in Luton\"\n\"Human, for a Minute\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCharlie Steen: lead vocals\nEddie Green: guitar, vocals\nJosh Finerty: bass, vocals\nSean Coyle-Smith: guitar, vocals\nCharlie Forbes: drums\nFreddy Wordsworth: trumpet\nCampbell Baum: saxophone\nKai Akinde-Hummel: percussion\nOliver Hamilton: violin\nMagdalena McLean: violin\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Duncan Harrison\nDirectors: Benjamin Brook and Jerry Dobson\nCamera Operators: Callum Chaplin and Lawrence Jones\nSound Engineer: Tom LeBeau\nHorn and String Arrangements: Josh Finerty\nMixing: Josh Finerty and Nina Madley\nEditor: Benjamin Brook\nSpecial thanks to Elliot Lynks\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Alex Drewenskus\nTiny Production Team: Maia Stern, Josh Rogosin, Gabrielle Pierre, Bobby Carter\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#shame #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYlX_R9opns", "date_published": "2021-07-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
