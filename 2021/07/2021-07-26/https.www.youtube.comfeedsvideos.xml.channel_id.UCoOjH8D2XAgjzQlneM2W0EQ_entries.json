He had been crippled with dyslexia his whole life to where he could barely read by the age of 8 and was completely lost when it came to numbers. So school was a torture. And by high school, he had started his first real business: a magazine for students. Seeing him struggle, his high school headmaster called him in one day and said, you can either leave the school and run the magazine, or stay in school and leave the magazine. Richard Branson became a high school dropout.\n\nRichard Branson was born in London in 1950. He came from a loving, happy family. Even as a kid, Branson had an entrepreneurial spirit. And although he had a natural talent for business, Branson wasn\u2019t great in school because of his dyslexia.\n\nFast forward to the 60s, and the youth wanted a voice. It\u2019s not surprising that soon after the magazine took off, Branson\u2019s headmaster gave him that ultimatum: leave the school and run the magazine, or stay in school and leave the magazine.\n\nAs a way to make money for the magazine, Branson got the idea to sell discounted music records by mail. The business took off, but just 5 months after opening, the tax man came knocking and threw him in jail. \n\nWhile running the record store, Branson came across a guitar demo made by a 15 year old musician. Instead of letting that discourage him, he thought \u201cscrew it, let\u2019s do it,\u201d and created a record label just like that to record it themselves. The album's success made Richard a millionaire before his 23rd birthday.\n\n24 year old Richard Branson was living the rockstar millionaire life. But Branson wanted to do more. And out of the blue, an insurance lawyer called him and asked Branson to back him on starting a Transatlantic Airline.\n\nWhen Branson launched Virgin Atlantic, one simply didn\u2019t just \u201cstart an airline\u201d. Virgin Atlantic was launched with a single, used airplane leased from Boeing. But Virgin Atlantic\u2019s biggest competitor, British Airways, wasn\u2019t happy with this newcomer on the block. So they launched what the media would call the Dirty Tricks Campaign.\n\nBranding is what Virgin is all about. Richard set out to embody that brand and he did everything he could think of to promote it. Some worked, some went under, but he didn\u2019t stop expanding.\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
