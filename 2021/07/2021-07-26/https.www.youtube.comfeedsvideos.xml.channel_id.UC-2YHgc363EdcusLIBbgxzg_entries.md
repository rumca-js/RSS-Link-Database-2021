Carl Sagan is an absolute legend and a hero, and his book Contact and the movie it's based on is phenomenal. HOWEVER... we examined the central conceit of the story - that aliens pick up our radio signals and return a message with instructions to build a machine - and look at the stars inside the 100 light-year bubble around Earth where our radio waves have traveled. And the potential of this happening... Well, it isn't good.

Sorry Carl.
