In this episode of The Bee Weekly, Kyle and Ethan are joined by fan favorite Seamus Coughlin (twitter.com/seamus_coughlin) of FreedomToons (www.youtube.com/user/Cartanimation) to talk about skunks in pickle jars, Facebook warning you about all the extremists they platform, and how The Babylon Bee doesnâ€™t make fun of Trump. Thereâ€™s also weird news, hate mail, and the ultimate showdown between Calvinists and Catholics that will once and for all settle all theological debates.
