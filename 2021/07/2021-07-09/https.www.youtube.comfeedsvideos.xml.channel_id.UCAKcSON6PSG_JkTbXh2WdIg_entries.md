Songwriters and artists have often used their art to influence social change. As unrest broke out in the city of Minneapolis in the wake of George Floyd's murder, Minnesota musicians turned to their creative outlets as agents of change.

In this fourth installment of our LineCheck conversation series, Anastasia Ellis asked Maria Isa, Muja Messiah, and Nur-D about their activism, music, and where we go from here. Performances by Layce Dreamz and Melissa Belfry of Sounds of Blackness bookended the conversation.
