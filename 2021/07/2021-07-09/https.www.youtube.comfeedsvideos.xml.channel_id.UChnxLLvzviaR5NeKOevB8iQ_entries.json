I sold it after having it for about a week after buying it new. It's a really interesting oscillator but I found it pretty unwieldy to use. YMMV!\n\nI have a big video of just performances with this thing over yonder: https://youtu.be/1vykoQD0Zs8\n\nModules used in this video:\nAfter Later Monsoon:  http://bit.ly/pc_after_later\nBubblesound HEXvca: http://bit.ly/pc_hexvca\nIntellijel Quad VCA: http://bit.ly/pc_quadvca\nIntellijel Quadrax: http://bit.ly/pc_quadrax\nKlavis Quadigy: http://bit.ly/pc_quadigy\nKlavis Twin Waves MkII: http://bit.ly/pc_twin_waves\nOrnament and Crime:  http://bit.ly/pc_oc\nALM Pamela's New Workout: https://bit.ly/2QRxnZO\nTip-Top Z5000: http://bit.ly/pc_z5000\nVarigate 8+: http://bit.ly/pc_varigate\nVPME QD: http://bit.ly/pc_VPME_QD\nXAOC Devices Zadar: http://bit.ly/pc_zadar\n------------------------------------\nIf you'd like to support the channel, I have a Patreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nI have music as \"Jeremy Blake\" on all the major services: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nI have some merch here: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nAnd you can connect with me here: \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRSw2hV6Lck", "date_published": "2021-07-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
