## Nintendo Switch OLED Hands On Impressions

We got our first hands-on with the new Nintendo Switch OLED, and while it's not the next big thing, it left us impressed with how much it improved the console.

Following the sudden announcement of the Nintendo Switch OLED, there have been many questions from fans about what to make of the new addition to the Switch family. Joining the original Switch and Switch Lite, the new model features a new 7-inch OLED display, enhanced audio, extra internal storage, a new dock with a built-in LAN port. Set for release on October 8, the new OLED model presents a new way for players to engage with the Nintendo Switch.

GameSpot was able to get some limited hands-on time with the upgraded Switch, and we came away with some answers about what to expect with the new console. Along with that, we got to see how bright that new screen is and learned whether or not that $350 price tag is justified for a new version of Nintendo's hybrid console. In this video, you can hear our thoughts on what it was like getting to experience the new OLED screen and how different of an experience it is to play older games like The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and more on a brighter and smaller screen.
