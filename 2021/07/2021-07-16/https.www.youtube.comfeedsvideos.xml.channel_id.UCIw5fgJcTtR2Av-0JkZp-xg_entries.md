Still on lockdown! :( So here's another jam, a personal favourite from my movie remixes, "Two At A Time".

Synth-Nerd Info:

This jam is DAWless. @SingularSoundOfficial Aeros Loop Studio is in two-track mode slaved to Octatrack, which is the master clock. MIDI Maestro footswitch controls Octatrack patterns, which have one-shot record trigs linked to 4 separate flex tracks (1-4) from the corresponding thru tracks (4-8). Drums are looped within the 1010music BlackBox, which is also slaved to the Octatrack. 1010music BlueBox mixes all the tracks using internal delay, reverb and eq/filter, with additional Strymon Bigsky reverb as a send/return via BlueBox.
Fender Strat runs thru a Ceriatone Tut Reverb (AA1164) into a Weber Minimass line out (plus a simple attenuator pot pedal for line level control) to Strymon Iridium in Cab Mode.
Synths are Moog Sub37 Bob Moog Tribute Edition, Korg Minilogue, Microkorg XL Plus.
Piano is running through a Strymon Mobius for lofi warbly effect.
Vocal gooseneck mic (from the Microkorg) is running through a JHS Colour Box V2 preamp and eq to the Aeros Loop Studio.
Samples are triggered on the BlackBox by an Octatrack midi channel.
