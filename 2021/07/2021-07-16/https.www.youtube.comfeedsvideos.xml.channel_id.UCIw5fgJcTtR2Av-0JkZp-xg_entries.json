MIDI Maestro footswitch controls Octatrack patterns, which have one-shot record trigs linked to 4 separate flex tracks (1-4) from the corresponding thru tracks (4-8). Drums are looped within the 1010music BlackBox, which is also slaved to the Octatrack. 1010music BlueBox mixes all the tracks using internal delay, reverb and eq/filter, with additional Strymon Bigsky reverb as a send/return via BlueBox.\nFender Strat runs thru a Ceriatone Tut Reverb (AA1164) into a Weber Minimass line out (plus a simple attenuator pot pedal for line level control) to Strymon Iridium in Cab Mode.\nSynths are Moog Sub37 Bob Moog Tribute Edition, Korg Minilogue, Microkorg XL Plus.\nPiano is running through a Strymon Mobius for lofi warbly effect.\nVocal gooseneck mic (from the Microkorg) is running through a JHS Colour Box V2 preamp and eq to the Aeros Loop Studio.\nSamples are triggered on the BlackBox by an Octatrack midi channel.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEqOLsWfqT4", "date_published": "2021-07-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
