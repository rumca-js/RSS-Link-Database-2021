i wanted to get back to the big rack. lots of changes to the sound sources and sequencers. hermod is out, metron is in, as is moskwa. arturia keystep pro is also doing melodic sequencing. korg modwave is being sequenced by keystep pro, doing a split patch with a bass and chord sound.

I've been having a lot of fun with stepped modulation going into the parameters of make noise erbe-verb. the decay and absorption parameters are getting stepped modulation from the noise engineering memetic digitalis so it rings out and then clamps down.

main drums are vpme qd, loops and percussion are from eric synths sample drum. I'm using a morphagene reel with the sample start time being step-modulated and a drum loop.

sounds are from plaits (noise seq), rings (starting sound, throughout), ensemble oscillator (lead sting early on), and klavis twin waves (bass and arp). beads and the after later monsoon are the additional effects. plaits, ensemble, and klavis 1 go into monsoon. rings into beads. klavis two (bass) into dry. 

the acid rain navigator x 2 is playing a big roll here. one controls the timbre of the ensemble and the modulation of rings, the other controls the range and speed of moskwa. 

buy these modules at perfect circuit:
