In this episode of The Bee Weekly, Kyle Mann and Ethan Nicolle are joined by musician, actress, and comedienne Chandler Juliet to talk about the most recent bad takes on social media, making music during the pandemic, and the library in the UK being forced to apologize for the “rainbow dill pickle monkey” brought in to entertain children. They talk about weird news of the week, get to ask a woman what others are apparently asking Google about women, and also read our glorious hate mail.
