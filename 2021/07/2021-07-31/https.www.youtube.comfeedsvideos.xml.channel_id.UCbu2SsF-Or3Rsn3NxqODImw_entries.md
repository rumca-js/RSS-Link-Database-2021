Another round of secrets you probably don't know about in Breath of the Wild! This time we dive into the secret weak spot of Guardian Turrets, E3 assets still existing in the game, and how to get a guardian to return to you like a dog.

Breath of the Wild has been out for four years at this point, and players have found some amazing things, intended or not, that keep the game and its sense of discovery feeling fresh.

NEO TWEWY is an eccentric action-RPG with an endearing youthful attitude, though its narrative lulls can obstruct its best moments.

Michael enjoys his wild RPGs and felt like a cool teen again revisiting the world of TWEWY 13 years later. He spent about 40 hours with NEO TWEWY on Nintendo Switch to finish its main story and a handful of side quests, bouncing between Normal and Hard difficulty. Review code was provided by Square Enix.

Scav karma is a fairly new addition to Escape From Tarkov, but has changed much of the gameplay from raid to raid. With more careful cooperation between Scavs and even PMCs how has this changed the Tarkov experience?
