Clinton was poorly behaved earlier, smacking and beating up blackberry. For 181 seconds he asked for attention, head rubs, pets; and I ignored him. This may be construed as harsh cruelty, but Clinton must learn that they are consequences for his actions, even dire consequences such as these. No attention was paid to the Clinton, even after turning the camera off. No head rubs, no conversation, no pets, and no attention.

## NYC's homeless problem is a giant SCAM!
