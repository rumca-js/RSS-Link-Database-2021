Battlefield 2042 will introduce six retro maps and include over 40 vehicles and guns from across the series. The new Portal mode allows players to build custom matches that can pit seven armies from different eras against each other on remastered maps. The maps run on the latest Frostbite engine, which adds massive destruction to older titles and even some new areas to accommodate 128 players on smaller locations like Valparaiso from Bad Company 2. 

Battlefield 2042 will launch with 13 maps total thanks to the newly announced Portal mode that allows players to build custom matches using six retro maps. The maps are Battle of the Bulge and El Alamein from Battlefield 1942, Arica Harbor and Valparaiso from Bad Company 2, and Caspian Border and Noshahr Canals from Battlefield 3. Seven launch maps from the main game's All-Out Warfare section can also be used in this mode as well as all Specialists. Portal includes 40+ vehicles chosen by DICE from past games and 40+ fan-favorite guns that were influenced by user data. 

In this video, we break down what will be in the mode and how it works. The new web-based builder will allow players to set up highly customized matches where they can manipulate a huge number of variables, picking from seven different armies and choosing which eras to pit against each other, down to the very granular including tweaking weapon damage, health, attachments, and even game logic. With factions from different eras battling each other, Portal will have a wide variety of gadgets, including the defibrillator and EOD Bot as well as the classic Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon roles. 

Battlefield 2042 will launch on October 15 for those who preorder certain editions of the game and October 22 for everyone else. There will be an open beta in September and some closed technical alphas that players can sign up for to get a chance to test cross-play, cross-commerce, and cross-save. We are still waiting to hear more about 2042's final mode, called Hazard Zone, which is a high-stakes mode but not a battle royale.
