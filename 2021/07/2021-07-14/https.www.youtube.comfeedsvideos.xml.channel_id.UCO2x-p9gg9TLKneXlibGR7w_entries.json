Even niche products sell in the tens of millions; however, the HomePod released in 2017 is estimated to have sold around just 5 million units during its product life cycle. The product is discontinued\u2014dead\u2014but still continues to get new updates with iOS 15. Why? Is Apple doing something behind the curtain that we just can't see? Today, we take a look at Apple's other failed hi-fi speaker\u2014one that launched over 15 years ago at the exact same $349 price point. Why do they keep screwing these speaker systems up? What might they be planning for the future? Have they given up and settled on HomePod mini? I don't think so...\n\n#retro #apple #roborock #roborockh7 #cordlessvacuum", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxxzdWsvwV0", "date_published": "2021-07-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
