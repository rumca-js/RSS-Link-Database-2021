Third wave in hospitals

Admission, + 582

People are still critically unwell with it - I cannot quite believe we're back at this stage again - it's really worrying."

Currently 22 Covid patients

Five in intensive care

Average ages lower than during the first two waves

Two seriously ill, 30s, unvaccinated

Visits to adult wards suspended

Patients likely to increase into August

Behaviour of local communities from 19 July will determine how serious the challenge will be

We are praying that the public do maintain some sense of perspective on this - somewhere between everybody being locked down and getting what they want

Unvaccinated people in the UK

17,5881 new daily symptomatic cases of COVID on average

(based on PCR test data)

Last week it was 22,638 (down 22%)

Suggesting that the wave in the unvaccinated population has now peaked in the UK

Vaccinated people in the UK

15,537 new daily symptomatic cases in partly or fully vaccinated 

Last week it was 11,084 (up 40%)

With cases in the vaccinated group continuing to rise, 

the number of new cases in the vaccinated population is set to overtake the unvaccinated in the coming days

This is probably because we’re running out of unvaccinated susceptible people to infect as more and more people get the vaccine. 

Whilst the figures look worrying, it’s important to highlight that vaccines have massively reduced severe infections and post-vaccination COVID is a much milder disease for most people. 

The main concern is now the risk of Long COVID.

Prevalence

One in 142 people in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID
