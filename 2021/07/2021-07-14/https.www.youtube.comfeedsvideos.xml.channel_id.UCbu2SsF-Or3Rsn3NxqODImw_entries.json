Now, 10 years later, it\u2019s being remastered in HD for the Nintendo Switch. In this game, Link and Zelda are childhood best friends who live on an island in the sky named Skyloft. After evil forces kidnap Zelda and take her to the surface, it\u2019s up to Link to fulfill his destiny as the Goddess' chosen hero and save the world from the evil that wants to control it.\n\nA few things to note about this video: The original version of Skyward Sword is a Wii game, but the footage used in this video is the Wii version running on a Wii U and captured at 1080p, so it\u2019s the original standard definition image quality blown up. The HD version is captured on Switch at 1080p. The Wii version is running at 30fps, while the new HD remaster runs at 60fps, so you\u2019ll notice one is smoother than the other. And lastly, the new Switch version is being played with the newly added button controls\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD releases for Nintendo Switch on July 16, 2021. Alongside the game, Nintendo is releasing a pair of Joy-Con controllers themed after the Master Sword and Hylian Shield, and a Zelda & Loftwing amiibo figure.
