I haven't done a video on it\njust because there are some details in the site coding we're still\nfiguring out, but books are already printing, shipping and arriving at\nsome of your houses.</p>\n<p>Just a couple technical notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I switched the Stripe backend of the site over the weekend. This\nmakes no changes for you, but if you have site cookies from a\nprevious visit, it will cause the site to break on checkout. Clear\nyour cookies for the site or use a private browsing instance to\nsolve this problem.</li>\n<li>We've had a couple errors processing some, but not all\ncryptocurrency payments. If you bought books with BTC, ETH or XMR,\njust shoot me an email and provide the transaction ID (and exact\namount as well if XMR) and I'll check for you. There's a small\nchance that your payment went through, but did not queue an order.\nIn that case, I will promptly refund your fundos to the whatever\naddress you'd like.</li>\n<li>Have people been receiving tracking number emails? If you have, say\nso. You should get an email right after placing the order, then one\nseveral days later after the book is printed with the tracking\nnumber.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, the site is working great, and once we're sure it's\nbugfree, I'll announce it on the channel and start adding more and more\nbooks. I have many underway already.</p>", "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/updates/important-lindypress-undergoing-some-updates/", "date_published": "2021-07-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": null}]
