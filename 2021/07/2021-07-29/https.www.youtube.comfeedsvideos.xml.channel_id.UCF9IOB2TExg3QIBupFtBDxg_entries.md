60,000 per day for past week

R = 1

Vaccinated, 24,000

Unvaccinated, 26,000

(Unvaccinated are a small proportion, relative rates in groups)

Higher overall number of vaccinated people will get infected as these are now the majority of the population

One vaccine of total infections, 22%

Two vaccines of total infections, 18%

Prevalence, 1 in 84 people with infection or symptoms

Similar to February 2021

But a much more optimistic picture

Vaccines are still clearly working against severe problems

Drop in government cases

Sudden drops are unusual in pandemics

Dramatic drop when Zoe is flat

Reduction in cases in the young

School class bubbles generated a lot of positive tests

Pingdemic

Holidays

Few with persistent cough, anosmia, fever

Symptoms

Cold like symptoms for vaccinated and unvaccinated

Headache at the top of both lists

Survey on NHS app

700,000 responses

22% had downloaded then deleted the app

425,000 have had app switched on

Ping rate, 10%

Of those pinged in the last month

17 -25s 28%
25 – 30s 22%
35 – 55s 14%
55 – 75s 8%
75 + 6%

Covid and diet
Government survey, n = 5,000
As opposed to 1 million
40% gained 3kg

Vaccine mandates

Civilian federal workers
