Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | July 30, 2021\nThe first time I saw shame singer Charlie Steen, he was stripped down to nothing but his Racing Green brand underwear (which he had wedged up his behind), as guitar, bass and drums punctuated his emphatic vocals. In this Tiny Desk (home) concert, we find Charlie in a full suit, tie and hat, sitting in a living room atmosphere backed not only by the rest of shame (also seated), but a compendium of violins, horns and more.\n\nAll the songs here are from the band's 2021 album, Drunk Tank Pink. It's the sound of this South London post-punk band challenging not only their listeners, but themselves. What a thrill.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Snow Day\"\n\"Born in Luton\"\n\"Human, for a Minute\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCharlie Steen: lead vocals\nEddie Green: guitar, vocals\nJosh Finerty: bass, vocals\nSean Coyle-Smith: guitar, vocals\nCharlie Forbes: drums\nFreddy Wordsworth: trumpet\nCampbell Baum: saxophone\nKai Akinde-Hummel: percussion\nOliver Hamilton: violin\nMagdalena McLean: violin\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Duncan Harrison\nDirectors: Benjamin Brook and Jerry Dobson\nCamera Operators: Callum Chaplin and Lawrence Jones\nSound Engineer: Tom LeBeau\nHorn and String Arrangements: Josh Finerty\nMixing: Josh Finerty and Nina Madley\nEditor: Benjamin Brook\nSpecial thanks to Elliot Lynks\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Alex Drewenskus\nTiny Production Team: Maia Stern, Josh Rogosin, Gabrielle Pierre, Bobby Carter\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#shame #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYlX_R9opns", "date_published": "2021-07-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tiny Desk Contest Top Shelf: Episode 2 with Phoebe Bridgers", "description": "NPR Music received thousands of submissions to this year's Tiny Desk Contest, our annual search for the next great undiscovered artist to play a Tiny Desk concert.
