<p>Although I haven't announced in a video on the YouTube channel yet,
I'm glad that there's been a lot of interest in
<a href="https://lindypress.net">LindyPress.net</a>. I haven't done a video on it
just because there are some details in the site coding we're still
figuring out, but books are already printing, shipping and arriving at
some of your houses.</p>
<p>Just a couple technical notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I switched the Stripe backend of the site over the weekend. This
makes no changes for you, but if you have site cookies from a
previous visit, it will cause the site to break on checkout. Clear
your cookies for the site or use a private browsing instance to
solve this problem.</li>
<li>We've had a couple errors processing some, but not all
cryptocurrency payments. If you bought books with BTC, ETH or XMR,
just shoot me an email and provide the transaction ID (and exact
amount as well if XMR) and I'll check for you. There's a small
chance that your payment went through, but did not queue an order.
In that case, I will promptly refund your fundos to the whatever
address you'd like.</li>
<li>Have people been receiving tracking number emails? If you have, say
so. You should get an email right after placing the order, then one
several days later after the book is printed with the tracking
number.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the site is working great, and once we're sure it's
bugfree, I'll announce it on the channel and start adding more and more
books. I have many underway already.</p>
