One year ago this week, Kathleen Edwards performed a virtual session recorded at home for The Current. After largely stepping away from music for several years, Edwards delighted her fans in May 2020 when she announced her fifth studio album, "Total Freedom," would be released on August 14 of that year. In the run-up to the album's release, Edwards played two songs from the record in this solo acoustic performance.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Options Open"
3:12 "Who Rescued Who"
