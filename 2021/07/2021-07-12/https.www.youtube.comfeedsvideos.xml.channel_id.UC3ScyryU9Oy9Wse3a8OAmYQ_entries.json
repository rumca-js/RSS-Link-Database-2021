Fmr NY Fed Exec Worries About Fed Policies | \"The Power of the Fed\" | FRONTLINE", "description": "Peter R. Fisher spent more than a decade working at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In this excerpt from the new documentary \"The Power of the Fed,\" he has a warning about the actions of the Fed system of which he was once part.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \n\n\u201cI feel as anxious today as I've ever felt about the financial world, because of my belief that the Fed has been pumping up asset prices in a way that is creating a bit of an illusion,\u201d Fisher tells FRONTLINE correspondent James Jacoby in the new documentary \"The Power of the Fed.\" \"And I think it \u2014 I think the odds are now sort of one in three, very high, that we will look at this as an epic mistake and one of the great financial calamities of all time.\u201d\n\nFisher, who left his role as executive vice president and manager of the System Open Market Account of the New York branch of the nation\u2019s central bank in 2001, is just one of the former and current Fed insiders who speak with FRONTLINE in the new documentary, along with economists, journalists and titans of finance. From the award-winning investigative team behind \"Amazon Empire\" and \"The Facebook Dilemma,\" \"The Power of the Fed\" examines the roots of the Federal Reserve\u2019s attempt to avert financial crisis when COVID-19 struck and how the institution continues to pump billions of dollars into the financial system daily, more than a year later \u2014 a process Fisher criticizes.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s response to COVID, the film finds, is the latest chapter in an experiment begun after the 2008 crash that involves both lowering interest rates to almost zero, and creating new money and injecting it into the financial system in a process called \u201cquantitative easing. That experiment has been dramatically changing the American economy ever since \u2014 and was ramped up in a big way when the coronavirus pandemic hit, the filmmakers find, helping to stave off total economic collapse.\n\n\u201cWe're lucky that the government was successful, or we could be living through a true depression,\u201d Lev Menand, a former economic advisor to the Fed and the Treasury Department, says in the film.\n\nWhile well-intentioned, the Fed\u2019s experiment has delivered mixed results over the years, some experts say in the documentary, with the biggest benefits going to Wall Street rather than Main Street, wealth inequity widening and the risk of inflation growing.\n\nNeel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, defends the Fed\u2019s actions and impacts on the economy in the documentary.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has been on a mission, I've been on a mission, to put Americans back to work and help them get their wages up, especially for those lowest-income Americans,\u201d Kashkari says. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s had some effect on Wall Street, to me, the tradeoff is well worth it, if we can put Americans back to work, so that they can put food on the table, they can take care of themselves. That is profoundly beneficial to society.\u201d\n\nWatch \"The Power of the Fed\" in full starting July 13: https://to.pbs.org/3hH4Z85\n\nThe correspondent is James Jacoby.

Jones, sent shock and grief through that city\u2019s Black community.\n\nIn 1965, Jones, a trailblazing attorney in Louisville, was found dead, floating in the Ohio River \u2014 the victim of a murder that\u2019s still unsolved today. Thirty-four-year-old Jones was the city\u2019s first female prosecutor, and a charismatic fixture in the Black community, helping educate and register people to vote.\n\nDespite multiple investigations over nearly 60 years, there are no official motives or suspects in her killing. In 2018, her case was added to the federal government\u2019s cold case list and is one of the few that remains open.\n\nIn episode 4, James explores what an open case on the list looks like through the life and death of Alberta Jones \u2014 and talks to the person who never gave up fighting for answers.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

Here's What Led to the Shooting. | FRONTLINE", "description": "Bodycam footage obtained by The Salt Lake Tribune and FRONTLINE from the West Valley City Police in Utah, reveals what preceded a fatal, point-blank shooting of a handcuffed man \u2014 including the man\u2019s denied requests for psychiatric help, which have never before been reported.\n \nWARNING: This video contains graphic footage of a person being killed in police custody and strong language.\n \nIn the two years since Michael Chad Breinholt\u2019s August 23, 2019, shooting death, the public has only seen a sliver of what happened in bodycam footage released by police. Now, this video draws on newly obtained bodycam footage to paint a fuller picture of what happened, showing how the encounter that would lead to Breinholt\u2019s death began, and how officers\u2019 handling of him turned fatal. \n \nWhen police initially responded to a call about Breinholt, his girlfriend told police, \u201che told me he took, like, eight or nine pills,\u201d and said Breinholt told her \u201che took all those pills so he\u2019ll die.\u201dOver the course of the next two hours, while booking Breinholt on DUI charges, police denied his requests for psychiatric help \u2014 at one point, leaving him lying on the floor for more than 11 minutes while waiting for a medical team\u2019s review. Police did not inform the medics that he had taken pills possibly attempting to end his life.\n \nOfficers had already searched Breinholt for weapons, the footage reveals. But after a disoriented Breinholt began claiming he had a gun, an officer began grappling with him. Eventually, Breinholt was shot point-blank by police sergeant Tyler Longman while his hands were cuffed behind his back. One officer claimed Breinholt had grabbed his gun, although it was never removed from the holster. \n \n\u201cYou\u2019re about to die, my friend,\u201d Longman said prior to firing the fatal shot.\n \nThe West Valley City Police Department found Sergeant Longman's use of deadly force within policy. As of July 12, 2021, the district attorney has not filed any charges.\n \nThis is the third person Sergeant Longman has killed while on duty. The previous two shootings in 2007 and 2008 were ruled legally justified.\n \nThis reporting is part of FRONTLINE\u2019s partnership with The Salt Lake Tribune through the FRONTLINE Local Journalism Initiative.
