## Aliens Didn't Try to Repeat Alien, It Engaged With It | In The Frame

Aliens was released 35 years ago this month, and it remains one of the best sequels ever made.

Alien was a masterpiece of science fiction horror. In their original Sneak Previews discussion of it, critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert correctly zeroed in on the film’s strengths: It was essentially “the haunted house film” transposed into space. It is now something of a cliché to return to Siskel’s original description of Alien as a “haunted house movie” or even a “haunted house in space,” but familiarity has rendered the observation no less accurate.
