What we see is that the vaccine is less effective in preventing transmission, 

but it’s easy to overlook that it’s still very effective in preventing hospitalization and severe cases

Those vaccinated in January, 16% protection
Those vaccinated in February, 44% protection
Those vaccinated in March, 67% protection
Those vaccinated in April, 75% protection

Immune escape more likely, from vaccine and natural immunity

Making reinfection more likely

Effect on transmitting the virus is still uncertain

Cases, up 53%

Hospitalizations, up 32%

Deaths, up 19%

Delta variant, 83% of cases circulating in US

Greatly increased viral load

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky

The delta variant is more aggressive and much more transmissible than previously circulating strains. 

It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of and that I have seen in my 20-year career

We are yet at another pivotal moment in this pandemic, with cases rising again and some hospitals reaching their capacity in some areas

We need to come together as one nation, unified in our resolve to protect the health of ourselves, our children, our community, our country and our future with the tools we have available
the 

Alabama Hospital Association

If you have not been vaccinated, now is the time

Cases are on the rise and the vaccine could save your life

Fully vaccinated, 34%

Cases up 74%

Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey

It’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks

It’s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down

Almost 100 percent of the new hospitalizations are with unvaccinated folks

Surge response teams

Sent to Missouri and Nevada

Walid Gellad, University of Pittsburgh

There are clearly examples of vaccinated people spreading the virus

The question is, how often is it happening?

Preparing the public and preparing clinicians for breakthrough infections, that’s the piece I think we’re not seeing

We need to know these things now, because two months from now is too late
