I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of of New York 1945

a time travel in beautiful New York 1945, we can clearly see what is happening in broad daylight, The right turn at 0:41 is onto 8th Avenue, traveling south. The turn appears to be around 50th Street. The Squire Theater, first visible in the distance on the right at about 1:20, was between 43rd and 44th. The Times Theater, visible at about 2:30, was showing The Princess And The Pirate, with Bob Hope and Virginia Mayo, which was released in November 1944. The Arena Theater, on the next block at 2:45, was on 41st Street. The film ends at 31st Street. (Thx Bobo4037)
