In this episode, Kyle and Ethan are joined by Kristin Weber (http://www.kristinweberonline.com/), a comedian, speaker, and author of several books including Adulting For Jesus (https://www.amazon.com/Adulting-Jesus-Trusting-Obviously-Burritos/dp/0830781854). She also plays a mean accordion. Kristin gifts us with our new theme song before getting into all the weird news of the week like how human civilization has finally reached pregnant man emojis and how crossword puzzles are bigoted now. Thereâ€™s also Real Things Blue Checks Say, Ask A Christian Woman, and glorious hate mail.
