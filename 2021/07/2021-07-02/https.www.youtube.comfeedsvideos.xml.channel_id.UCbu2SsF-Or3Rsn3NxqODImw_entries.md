Battlefield 4 servers are filling up again ahead of Battlefield 2042's release. In this video we take a look at what made BF4 an excellent first-person shooter and why you should give it another shot.

Battlefield 4 has seen a resurgence in popularity ever since DICE's latest game, Battlefield 2042, was announced. Despite a very rocky launch, Battlefield 4 has turned out to be a standout entry in the franchise with an excellent chaotic sandbox and a wide variety of weapons and vehicles. Combine that with a wide range of maps and post-launch content with DLC expansions and Battlefield 4 makes a case for being one of the strongest Battlefield games yet. In this video, we take a trip down memory lane and explore all the aspects that make Battlefield 4 such a good game, from the right hits of nostalgia to the consistent support by DICE in fine tuning of the gameplay. Join us as we dive into Battlefield 4, and why it's just so darn good.
