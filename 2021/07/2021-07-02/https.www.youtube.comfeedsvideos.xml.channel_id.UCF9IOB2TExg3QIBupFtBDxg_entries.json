degree of protecting those who are most at risk, as long as there are these nasty viruses around, whether or not we\u2019re vaccinated\n\nIt makes people very angry because they want to be able to stop being careful but it\u2019s my advice,\n\nand it\u2019s just based on studying these things over the years, is that it is not a cool thing just to ditch our preventative measures on a particular date because we hope that\u2019s going to be associated with less risk - the risks are going to stay\n\nUK Vaccine boosters in Autumn\n\nAll adults aged 50 and over\n\nNHS and care staff\n\nAnyone who
