I have colorized and digitally restored and worked a sound design for this video of  San Francisco 1940's
a time travel in 1940's , we can clearly see what is happening in broad daylight, the San Francisco Ferry Building way in the distance with its famous tower almost centered with Market Street  (thank you:

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
