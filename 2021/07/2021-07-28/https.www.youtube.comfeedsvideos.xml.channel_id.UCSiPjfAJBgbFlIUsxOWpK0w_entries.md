Gardenview out now, listen on Spotify (https://sptfy.com/gardenview) or wherever you listen to music.

 Somehow, the universe decided to make our song a TikTok meme! You may have seen it… “Johnny don’t leave me” or “Bust your kneecaps” if you’re OG. Anyhoo, we thought we’d release a lyric video for it! Ten years after the fact haha.

Lyrics:
Jonny don't leave me,
You said you'd love me forever.
Honey believe me,
I'll have your heart on a platter.

Might you recall,
We've got a small family business
And the Family won't like this.

They'll bust your knee caps.
Ooh wop de do wop de do.
They'll bust your knee caps.
Ooh wop de do wop de do.

Jonny you told me
you were no fool, you were no chump
Then you got cold feet.
Now all you'll be is a speed bump.

It's something we call,
Oh just a small family business.
And the family won't like this.

They'll bust your knee caps.
Ooh wop de do wop de do.
They'll bust your knee caps.
That's what they're going to do.

Jonny there's still time.
Together I know, we'd go so far.
I'll tell uncle Rocco
to call off the guys with the crowbars.

You call it crime.
We call it smart family business.
And the family is famous.

LET'S BUST SOME KNEE CAPS!!

It's such a shame
That you became such an issue.
Oh dear Jonny, I'll miss you.

They'll bust your knee caps.
That's what they're going to do.
They'll bust your knee caps.
Probably some other stuff, too.

They'll bust your knee caps.
Ooh wop de do wop de do.
They'll bust your knee caps.
Ooh yeah they're coming for you.

 And here’s a lyric video for the slowed-down version of Bust Your Kneecaps (Johnny don’t leave me)! Again…I’m not sure why this is a thing. But cool whatever!
