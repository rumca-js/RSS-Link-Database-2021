Pitch quantizers take incoming CVs and adhere them to a scale. In this video, we'll use voltage and LFOs on the Intellijel Tetrapad into Quantermain on After Later Audio Ornament and Crime, triggered by the Tubbutec 6equencer, into the 4ms Spherical Wavetable Navigator to make generative melodies.  Intellijel Rainmaker brings the wetness.

30 minutes of this as a downtempo / drum and bass performance here: https://youtu.be/mClExNlmGHc
