I hate drama, I didn't want to make this video, but apparently, I need to explain what happened on the "TLE Official" Discord server, so here it is!

In short, the TLDR is:
- Someone approached me to create an "official" server for the channel
- I agreed but didn't think of getting ownership of the server
- The owner of the server started making people leave by openly attacking a certain group of people
- Whether that was made as a joke or not, I don't know, and I don't care, this group gets these jokes thrown at them every day, they don't need that from a Linux Discord server, and even less from the admin / owner
- I told him I really didn't like it, and he kicked me out, renamed the server, and told everyone I had left because the server was too toxic.


I didn't leave, and I think the server was great, the admin just wasn't.


- I won't get into a debate on free speech: whether you make a joke, second degree, edgy, whatever, think about how many jokes of the sort the people you're targeting have already received. Imagine a characteristic of yourself that you have a hard time dealing with, that is causing confusion for you, and now imagine people make jokes to your face about it, every day, everywhere you go.


- You wouldn't take it either, and that's not something I could accept. It's not censorship, it's not "against free speech", it's just being a decent human being and not mocking others, even if you're doing it in good faith, for "fun".
