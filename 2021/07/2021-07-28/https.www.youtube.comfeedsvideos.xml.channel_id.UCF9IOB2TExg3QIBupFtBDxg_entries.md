60,000 per day for past week

R = 1

Vaccinated, 24,000

Unvaccinated, 26,000

(Unvaccinated are a small proportion, relative rates in groups)

Higher overall number of vaccinated people will get infected as these are now the majority of the population

One vaccine of total infections, 22%

Two vaccines of total infections, 18%

Prevalence, 1 in 84 people with infection or symptoms

Similar to February 2021

But a much more optimistic picture

Vaccines are still clearly working against severe problems

Drop in government cases

Sudden drops are unusual in pandemics

Dramatic drop when Zoe is flat

Reduction in cases in the young

School class bubbles generated a lot of positive tests

Pingdemic

Holidays

Few with persistent cough, anosmia, fever

Symptoms

Cold like symptoms for vaccinated and unvaccinated

Headache at the top of both lists

Survey on NHS app

700,000 responses

22% had downloaded then deleted the app

425,000 have had app switched on

Ping rate, 10%

Of those pinged in the last month

17 -25s 28%
25 – 30s 22%
35 – 55s 14%
55 – 75s 8%
75 + 6%

Covid and diet
Government survey, n = 5,000
As opposed to 1 million
40% gained 3kg

US, CDC, fully vaccinated should resume wearing masks indoors

K-12 everyone wear masks indoors

Areas of high or substantial transmission, 63.5% of US

Fully vaccinated people can still catch and transmit the delta variant

100 million eligible people not vaccinated

Breakthrough infection

risk for SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated

people fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine are less likely than unvaccinated persons to acquire SARS-CoV-2 or to transmit it to others 

as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus

Onward transmission from vaccinated people (CDC)

Multiple studies in different countries

Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine

People who develop COVID-19 have a lower viral load, which

may indicate reduced transmissibility

Significantly reduced likelihood of transmission from vaccinated people to household contacts

US Vaccine efficacy

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html

US Protection against infection

Pfizer and Moderna, 86 to 89% protection against infection 

Asymptomatic infection, 80%

US Protection against hospitalization

All authorised vaccines give  more than 89% protection

Pfizer and Moderna, 96%

US Protection against death

All authorised vaccines, high protection

Israel

Infection, 92%

Symptomatic infection, 94%

Severe disease, 92%

Hospitalization, 87%

Vaccine-induced cellular immunity

Moderna or Pfizer vaccine recipients

Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Epsilon variants

CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses

Modest or no defects in cellular immune recognition of the variants

Cellular immunity may help limit disease severity
