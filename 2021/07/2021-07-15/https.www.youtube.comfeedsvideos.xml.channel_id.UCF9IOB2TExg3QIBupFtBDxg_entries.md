COVID-19: risk factors linked to post vaccination breakthrough infections

Clinical microbiology and infection

https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(21)00367-0/fulltext

A minority of vaccinated individuals might get infected and suffer significant morbidity

Characteristics of vaccine breakthrough infections

Population (9 million) of Israeli patients, who were hospitalized with COVID-19 despite full vaccination.

Methods

Retrospective multicenter cohort study of 17 hospitals 

Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2 fully-vaccinated patients

Who developed COVID-19 and required hospitalization

(more than 7 days after the second vaccine)

(18% of admissions were before 21 days after second dose)

Alpha, B.1.1.7, 89% (UK)

Wildtype, 7%

Beta, B.1.351, 4% (SA)

Results

N = 152 patients

(half of hospitalized fully-vaccinated patients in Israel, 5.17million people)

Median age, 71.1 (range, 22-98) years

(half of hospitalized fully-vaccinated patients in Israel)

Poor outcomes in 38 patients

Mortality rate 22% (34/152)

Cohort characterized by a high rate of comorbidities

Hypertension 108, (71%)

Diabetes 73, (48%)

CHF 41, (27%)

Chronic kidney 37, (24%)

Chronic lung diseases 37, (24%)

Dementia 29, (19%)

Cancer 36, (24%)

No comorbidities, 9, (6 %)

Immunocompromised 60, (40%)

Higher SARS-CoV-2 viral-load was associated with a significant risk for poor outcome

Conclusions

Severe COVID-19 infection, with a high mortality rate, might develop in a minority of fully-vaccinated, with multiple comorbidities

(Higher rate of comorbidities and immunosuppression compared to non-vaccinated hospitalized patients)

Develop guidance to augment protection

Continued social-distancing

Additional vaccinations

(Israel, offering booster to immunocompramised)


WHO made errors

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/covid-wuhan-outbreak-who/2021/07/15/51e7e8a6-e2c6-11eb-88c5-4fd6382c47cb_story.html

Said it will fix several unintended errors

https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-convened-global-study-of-origins-of-sars-cov-2-china-part

Will look into other possible discrepancies

Questions from The Washington Post

Changing the virus sequence IDs associated with three of the 13 early patients

Will clarify that the first family cluster was not linked to the Huanan wet market in Wuhan

First patient, fell ill Dec. 8, 2019

Lived on the other side of the Yaangtze river, in Wuchang district

(WIV is in Jiangxia district)

Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman

the question of where the first-known patient lived relative to the river was not relevant to the origin of the virus

the current first known patient is most probably not the first case

mistakes in the report were due to editing errors

they did not affect the data analysis process, nor the conclusions

Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law, Georgetown University

We need more explanation about what the source of the error and the information was

There’s no clarity, and this does feed into public distrust of the integrity and rigor of the origins investigation

UK, Cases, + 48,553
https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk

Third wave in hospitals

Admission, + 582

Dr Catherine Monaghan, University Hospital of North Tees

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57836137

People are still critically unwell with it - I cannot quite believe we're back at this stage again - it's really worrying."

Currently 22 Covid patients

Five in intensive care

Average ages lower than during the first two waves

Two seriously ill, 30s, unvaccinated

Visits to adult wards suspended

Patients likely to increase into August

Behaviour of local communities from 19 July will determine how serious the challenge will be

We are praying that the public do maintain some sense of perspective on this - somewhere between everybody being locked down and getting what they want

Covid symptom study

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/complacency-could-condemn-thousands-more-to-long-covid

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/new-cases-plateau-aead-of-freedom-day

Unvaccinated people in the UK

17,5881 new daily symptomatic cases of COVID on average

(based on PCR test data)

Last week it was 22,638 (down 22%)

Suggesting that the wave in the unvaccinated population has now peaked in the UK

Vaccinated people in the UK

15,537 new daily symptomatic cases in partly or fully vaccinated 

Last week it was 11,084 (up 40%)

With cases in the vaccinated group continuing to rise, 

the number of new cases in the vaccinated population is set to overtake the unvaccinated in the coming days

This is probably because we’re running out of unvaccinated susceptible people to infect as more and more people get the vaccine. 

Whilst the figures look worrying, it’s important to highlight that vaccines have massively reduced severe infections and post-vaccination COVID is a much milder disease for most people. 

The main concern is now the risk of Long COVID.

Prevalence

One in 142 people in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID

UK R = 1.0

Long covid

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.24.21259277v1

550 cases a day in unvaccinated

1.2% (age 20)

4.8% (age 63)

Next couple of weeks

Euro Football Championship

US

Cases, + 31,815
