But what exactly was changed? Well, we played both games to 100% completion and put them side by side to try and spot as many differences as we could, big and small.\n\nSome of these changes include button controls for the entire game, brand-new camera controls, a new autosave system, character names added to text boxes, amiibo functionality, and a bunch of others, but you\u2019ll have to watch the video to see everything. So stop reading this description and go do that if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD is now available for the Nintendo Switch. Alongside the game, Nintendo released a pair of Joy-Con controllers themed after the Master Sword and Hylian Shield, and a Zelda & Loftwing amiibo figure.

There will be cross-play and progression, both of which are being tested later this summer. We learned about the robot dog, whose name is Ranger, and how it will follow you and protect you with its life. We learned that players use call-in tablets to bring vehicles down mid-battle and also that the system is limited by team points that vary based on map and mode. There were details around how AI soldiers will fill or balance matches. AI soldiers will also do many of the same tasks as players but can\u2019t be specialists. It was confirmed that Sundance\u2019s wingsuit is a unique piece of gear and nobody else gets one. We learned about the new loadout system where anyone can make a choice between carrying a rocket launcher or bringing items such as ammo or health packs. Finally, we got more details on maps such as out of bounds being expanded, skyscrapers not having much in the way of interior spaces, and penguins being confirmed on the Breakaway Map.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 releases October 15 or 22, depending on which version you get, and makes a lot of changes to the formula, such as a new specialist system, larger maps, a freeform weapons system, a revamped Conquest mode with sectors, storms such as tornadoes, map-altering events like rocket launches, and a massive 128 player count. Up next, we are expecting to learn about the not-battle-royale Hazard Zone mode, remastered classic maps, and what the newly branded Ripple Effect studio, formerly DICE LA, is making.\n\n#battlefield #battlefield2042", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUdPuU7V6MY", "date_published": "2021-07-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Valve's Steam Deck - Who's It For?", "description": "If you enjoyed this discussion why not check out the GameSpot After Dark podcast!\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/5qmuPYfpj7R7yHXEtKBocG?si=l4eHPhXETPKJjZjWKilMPg&dl_branch=1\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gamespot-after-dark/id1476085691\n\nValve has revealed a portable gaming device the Steam Deck that brings PC-quality gaming to a handheld device.
