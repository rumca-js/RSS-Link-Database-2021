The HomePod failed spectacularly—with just 5 million units sold. But that wasn't the first $350 speaker Apple released on deaf ears.

It's pretty rare that Apple releases a product to market nowadays that doesn't perform well. Even niche products sell in the tens of millions; however, the HomePod released in 2017 is estimated to have sold around just 5 million units during its product life cycle. The product is discontinued—dead—but still continues to get new updates with iOS 15. Why? Is Apple doing something behind the curtain that we just can't see? Today, we take a look at Apple's other failed hi-fi speaker—one that launched over 15 years ago at the exact same $349 price point. Why do they keep screwing these speaker systems up? What might they be planning for the future? Have they given up and settled on HomePod mini? I don't think so...
