I'm using a morphagene reel with the sample start time being step-modulated and a drum loop.\n\nsounds are from plaits (noise seq), rings (starting sound, throughout), ensemble oscillator (lead sting early on), and klavis twin waves (bass and arp). beads and the after later monsoon are the additional effects. plaits, ensemble, and klavis 1 go into monsoon. rings into beads. klavis two (bass) into dry. \n\nthe acid rain navigator x 2 is playing a big roll here. one controls the timbre of the ensemble and the modulation of rings, the other controls the range and speed of moskwa. \n\nbuy these modules at perfect circuit:\n\nSOUNDS\nKorg Modwave: https://bit.ly/36D1zfU\n4ms Ensemble Oscillator: https://bit.ly/33TzPmd\nErica Synths Sample Drum: http://bit.ly/pc_sample_drum\nIntellijel Polaris: https://bit.ly/3ieJ3zZ\nVPME QD: http://bit.ly/pc_VPME_QD\nKlavis Twin Waves MkII: http://bit.ly/pc_twin_waves\nMutable Instruments Plaits: https://bit.ly/3sGjDi1\nMutable Instruments Rings: http://bit.ly/pc_rings\n\nMODULATION\nAcid Rain Navigator: https://bit.ly/2VEgiVI\nAbstract Devices ADE-32:  https://bit.ly/3zhnGFl\nIntellijel Quad VCA: http://bit.ly/pc_quadvca\nIntellijel Quadrax: http://bit.ly/pc_quadrax\nXAOC Zadar: http://bit.ly/pc_zadar\nNoise Engineering Memetic Digitalis: https://bit.ly/3z1KOap\nALM Pamela's New Workout: https://bit.ly/2QRxnZO\n\nEFFECTS\nAfter Later Monsoon: http://bit.ly/pc_after_later\nMake Noise Erbe Verb: https://bit.ly/3o8KCSI\nMutable Instruments Beads: https://bit.ly/3z23E1d\n\nSEQUENCING\n\nKeystep Pro: https://bit.ly/3uMKLNY\nXAOC Moskwa II: https://bit.ly/3wLmmZZ\nXAOC Ostankino II:  https://bit.ly/2SM0xLd\nWMD Metron: https://bit.ly/3eKLaLC\nOrnament and Crime: http://bit.ly/pc_oc\n------------------------------------\nPatreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nMy Music: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nMerch: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nConnect:\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NZdvpuv6Sc", "date_published": "2021-07-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
