In this special limited series, Emily Graslie and Trace Dominguez join me as we explore the universal rules of life that tie together Earth\u2019s living systems. In episode 1, we travel from Africa\u2019s Serengeti plains to the nearly extinct prairies of the western United States to discover the unexpected species that determine the very existence of these places. Can an ecosystem survive without its keystone species? And can we restore endangered human cultures by bringing back a nearly-extinct ecosystem?\n\nCo-hosted by:\nTrace Dominguez  @TraceDominguez \nEmily Graslie   @EmilyGraslie \n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/inournature-ep1-references/home \n\nIn Our Nature is a special miniseries produced by It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart for PBS.
