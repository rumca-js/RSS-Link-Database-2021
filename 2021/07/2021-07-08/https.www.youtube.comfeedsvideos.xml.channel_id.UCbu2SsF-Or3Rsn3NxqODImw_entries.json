Joining the original Switch and Switch Lite, the new model features a new 7-inch OLED display, enhanced audio, extra internal storage, a new dock with a built-in LAN port. Set for release on October 8, the new OLED model presents a new way for players to engage with the Nintendo Switch.\n\nGameSpot was able to get some limited hands-on time with the upgraded Switch, and we came away with some answers about what to expect with the new console. Along with that, we got to see how bright that new screen is and learned whether or not that $350 price tag is justified for a new version of Nintendo's hybrid console. In this video, you can hear our thoughts on what it was like getting to experience the new OLED screen and how different of an experience it is to play older games like The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and more on a brighter and smaller screen.\n\n#nintendoswitch #oled #switcholed", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6ciYrKXlW4", "date_published": "2021-07-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "12 Biggest Battlefield Maps Of All Time", "description": "Battlefield 2042 is bringing some of the biggest maps in Battlefield history.\u00a0In this video, we take a look back at the 12 largest\u00a0Battlefield\u00a0locations\u00a0of all time, like Dragon Valley from Battlefield 2, Bandar Desert from the Armored Kill DLC, and even the Halvoy battle royale map.\n\nBattlefield has a rich variety of multiplayer maps from its humble beginnings in Battlefield 1942, all the way to the massive Firestorm battle royale map in Battlefield V.

In this video, we\u2019re breaking down the top 12 largest Battlefield maps of all time.\n\nSurprisingly, one game stands out among the series and appears on the top 12 list more often than the others: Battlefield 2 comes roaring in with five maps, whereas games like Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 each only have one map, such as Bandar Desert, and Golmud Railway!\n\nWith Battlefield 2042 reveals coming at EA Play Live on July 22 and a renewed interest in Battlefield 4, we will be covering the series, including the teased Hazard Zone mode and expected alpha and beta dates, so definitely stay tuned!\n\n#Battlefield #Battlefield2042", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSbEX5yK84E", "date_published": "2021-07-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "9 Minutes of DEATHLOOP 4K Gameplay Walkthrough", "description": "Deathloop, published by Bethesda, sees players stuck in a time loop battling to survive and perfect their run.

So our very own Kurt Indovina weighs in on the conversation.\n\nWhile some may have been expecting a Switch Pro with 4K output, others are justifying reasons to upgrade from their current Switch to this OLED Model. However, there's also the consideration that the Switch OLED Model may not be intended for current Switch owners at all.\n\nIn the above video, Kurt Indovina takes a step back, and examines where the Nintendo Switch OLED Model exists in the current roster of Switches, as well as measure the value of its $350 price tag. What does it offer that the base model doesn't? Does it make sense if you play primarily docked? And if you're handheld gamer, why not just get the Switch Lite?
