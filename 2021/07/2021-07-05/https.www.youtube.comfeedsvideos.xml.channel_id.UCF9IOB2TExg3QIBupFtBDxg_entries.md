UK, 100,000 cases per day possible

Health Secretary Sajid Javid

makes sense to treat people differently

Self-isolation changes in England

Changes to school bubble system

Prime Minister, 19th July is on

(Scotland, 9th August)

19 July, cases at least double

so around 50,000 new cases a day

As we ease and go into the summer we expect case numbers to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 

Vaccines and treatments are far better than what we had when this pandemic began

UK was now entering uncharted territory

16th August, close contacts of confirmed cases no longer need to self isolate for 10 days if fully vaccinated or under 18s

Positive tests still must self-isolate

Prof Neil Ferguson, Imperial College

UK potential, 150,000 to 200,000 a day

still cause some pressure to the health system

slight gamble

justifiable

I'm reasonably optimistic

The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold

Worst-case scenario there may need to be a course correction later


UK

https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk

Cases, + 24,284 + 27,334 

Hospitalisations, + 358 = 1,905

Cases 10 days ago, 18,271

Proportion of cases hospitalised 10 days later = 1.96%

1st January, 2021, Cases, 61,239

10th January, hospitalisations, 3,933

Proportion of cases hospitalised 10 days later = 6.4%

## Vitamin D reduces hospital risk

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher hospitalisation risk from COVID-19: a retrospective case-control study (June 2021)

Not funded

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34139758/

https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgab439/6303537

Large scale, retrospective case-control study

North West of England

Two hospital groups

Lancaster and Tameside and Glossop

Objective

Is hospitalisation with COVID-19 more prevalent with lower vitamin D levels

Individuals with results of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D)

1st  April 2020 and 29th January 2021

Deficient = less than 25 nmol/L (10 ng/ml)

Insufficient = 25-50 nmol/L (10 to 20 ng/ml)

N = 80,670

1,808 were admitted to hospital with COVID-19

670 died

Primary cohort, n = 58,368

Median vitamin D levels in participants not hospitalised

50 nmol/L (20ng/ml)

(interquartile range, IQR 34.0-66.7 nmol/L)

Median vitamin D levels in participants hospitalised

35.0 nmol/L (14 ng/ml)

(interquartile range, 21.0-57.0nmol/L)

p  less than 0.005

Similar findings in a validation cohort, n = 21,234

Non-hospitalised = 47.1 nmol/L (IQR 31.8-64.7 nmol/L)

Hospitalised patients = 33.0 (IQR 19.4-54.1 nmol/L)

p less than 0.005

Adjusted odds ratios

Age, sex, seasonal variation- for hospital admission

OR = 2.3-2.4 times higher, 25(OH)D less than 50 nmol/L

OR for validation cohort, adjusted, = 2.33

No association between low vitamin D levels and in-patient hospital mortality from COVID-

19 in either cohort.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. 

Widespread measurement of serum 25(OH)D and treating any unmasked insufficiency or deficiency through testing may reduce this risk

We have clearly demonstrated that vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency exponentially increase the risk of the disease by a factor of 2.3 to 3.6, even after adjustments for age and sex.

Vitamin D is anti-inflammatory, and it has been shown to modulate the immune system

With its effect on macrophage function and innate immunity, vitamin D may alter the disease manifestations of COVID-19

Vitamin D supplementation should be an important consideration for deficient populations at risk
