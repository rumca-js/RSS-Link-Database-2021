It's not about the nail. Sometimes people were just put on this world to suffer, like because they want to. Most people actually enjoy the opportunity to degrade and pity themselves. The only real way to hurt their feelings is to suggest them to overcome their self-imposed problems.

Matrix and XMPP are the two (only) actually good, end-to-end encrypted and secure messaging software standards. Matrix is probably a little easier to use, but XMPP is realistically a better standard for reasons I explain here.

Regardless, Matrix and XMPP are massive improvements over Telegram, Whatsapp, Signal, traditional SMS/text and email. The are free, open-source and decentralized software which can be self-hosted, and offer real and well-vetted E2E (end-to-end) encryption.

I had done a write-up of this on my website too, if you prefer:
