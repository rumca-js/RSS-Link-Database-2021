<p>For a while, I've hinted that I've been contributing to a project to
reprint out-of-print classical and medieval texts that are of hidden
value, sometimes even in their original languages. I've worked on this
project for a while and now it's live and you can browse the first five
books available.</p>
<p>See the site at <a href="https://lindypress.net">https://lindypress.net</a>. All works have been
reformatted in XeLaTeX so that the text is grade-A in readability and
has nice little flourishes to make it a little more elegant. A lot of
other reprinting companies have their work done with less care.</p>
<p>Here are a list of the books available now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marcus Aurelius's <em>Meditations</em> (in English): a personal log that
Emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius kept. This is still
commonly read as a kind of a book of proverbs and motivation, and is
the only book of these where you can commonly find other reprints of
this book, but they usually have textual errors and aren't as nice.
This is a pocket book, making it easy to port around and read
leisurely.</li>
<li><em>Antimodernist Papal Encyclicals</em> (in English): A collection of six
major Catholic writings against liberalism, modernism, communism and
for the chastity of marriage and the economic model now called
&quot;distributism.&quot;</li>
<li><em>The Books of Enoch and the Book of Jubilees</em>: Hard to find
extra-Biblical books on the esoteric life and ascension of Enoch,
the Nephilim, the true story of the Flood and much more, all
well-formatted, translated from Ge'ez, Slavonic and Hebrew and in
one volume.</li>
<li>Isidore of Seville's book on Etymologies (in Latin): an
encyclopedia was used as a textbook for centuries in late antiquity
and the middle ages. It's a great compendium of information on
every topic and is a 400+ page hardback which can still be openned
and read at any point. I recommend this even more strongly for
Latin-learners because it's written in the simplest and clearest
prose and is instructive in nature and will help people acquire
vocabulary while practicing the language. Might even be a good
choice for an intermediate Latin class.</li>
<li>Roger Bacon's <em>Compendium Studii Theologiae</em> (in Latin): It's
extremely hard to find any prints of Roger Bacon's philosophical,
theological or alchemical works, so this is the first I've prepared
for reprinting. I'll soon finish his <em>Opus Tertium</em> as well. CST is
a another portable pocket book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the site for more information.</p>
<p>The site accepts either credit cards or Bitcoin/Monero/Ethereum for
payment. It works with the lightning network too.</p>
<p>(Note that this uses a print-on-demand service, so you might take a
couple days to print your books.)</p>
<p>I will make this site known on my YouTube channel in several days, but
for now, you can browse and get what you want.</p>
<p>There are many other books already in the works, but email me with
suggestions for more if you have them.</p>
<p>I really want to focus on things that are nearly impossible to find in
print in a presentable way. Compilations are also possible, similar to
the encyclical compilation.</p>
