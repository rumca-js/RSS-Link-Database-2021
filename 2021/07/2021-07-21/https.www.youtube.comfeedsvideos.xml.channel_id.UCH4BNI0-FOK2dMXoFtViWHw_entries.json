In this special limited series, Emily Graslie and Trace Dominguez join me as we explore the universal rules of life that tie together Earth\u2019s living systems. In episode 2, we study the complex family relationships of elephants in Africa\u2019s Serengeti plains and how their shared knowledge can help them survive. Then we travel to San Francisco to discover how the intricate songs of birds have changed in the face of our own culture. How common is culture in the animal kingdom? And what role does it play in the survival of species?\n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/in-our-nature-episode-2-refs/home \n\n00:00 Intro\n00:45 What is culture?\n02:42 Do animals have culture?\n03:33 Serengeti: Culture in African elephants\n14:18 San Francisco: Culture in urban songbirds\n23:34 Conclusion\n\nIn Our Nature is a special miniseries produced by It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart for PBS.
