The new Portal mode allows players to build custom matches that can pit seven armies from different eras against each other on remastered maps. The maps run on the latest Frostbite engine, which adds massive destruction to older titles and even some new areas to accommodate 128 players on smaller locations like Valparaiso from Bad Company 2.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 will launch with 13 maps total thanks to the newly announced Portal mode that allows players to build custom matches using six retro maps. The maps are Battle of the Bulge and El Alamein from Battlefield 1942, Arica Harbor and Valparaiso from Bad Company 2, and Caspian Border and Noshahr Canals from Battlefield 3. Seven launch maps from the main game's All-Out Warfare section can also be used in this mode as well as all Specialists. Portal includes 40+ vehicles chosen by DICE from past games and 40+ fan-favorite guns that were influenced by user data.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we break down what will be in the mode and how it works. The new web-based builder will allow players to set up highly customized matches where they can manipulate a huge number of variables, picking from seven different armies and choosing which eras to pit against each other, down to the very granular including tweaking weapon damage, health, attachments, and even game logic. With factions from different eras battling each other, Portal will have a wide variety of gadgets, including the defibrillator and EOD Bot as well as the classic Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon roles.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 will launch on October 15 for those who preorder certain editions of the game and October 22 for everyone else. There will be an open beta in September and some closed technical alphas that players can sign up for to get a chance to test cross-play, cross-commerce, and cross-save. We are still waiting to hear more about 2042's final mode, called Hazard Zone, which is a high-stakes mode but not a battle royale.\n\n#Battlefield2042", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzDHitLeGQg", "date_published": "2021-07-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Codemasters + Grid Legends Full Presentation | EA Play Live 2021", "description": "Codemasters (the developers behind racing games Dirt 5, F1 2021, and Grid) are joining the EA Family with a new entry in the Grid franchise: Grid Legends.

You're watching a three-player co-op from the first mission of the second campaign.\n\nAliens: Fireteam Elite is a new co-op action shooter set within the legendary Alien franchise. As a loose sequel to the 1986 film, this game sees colonial marines face off against xenomorphs and other hostile foes that pull on deep threads of Alien lore. We recently got some hands-on time with the game, playing through the first half of the game's campaign, and we saw just harrowing encounters can get when running and gunning through space stations and ancient tombs filled with xenomorphs and hostile synthetic soldiers.\n\nIn this new gameplay video, we play through the first mission of chapter 2, taking place on a planet that was once under control by the ancient Engineers--the mysterious alien race from the 2012 film Prometheus. Our squad of marines not only came face to face against xenomorphs but also saw some of the more surprising story turns in the game's campaign. As a squad-based shooter, you and two other players will be able to play as marines with different class types and weapon loadouts. Our squad used the gunner class to lay in fast damage in this gameplay, the demolisher class to tear through enemies with a high-powered smart flamethrower, and the tactician class to lay down support turrets. Fireteam Elite pays some hearty tribute to the Alien franchise, particularly the 1986 film, and it also lays the groundwork for what comes next. We're excited to see more of the game, and what's to come in the rest of the campaign.\n\nAliens: Fireteam Elite will release on August 24 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n#aliens #aliensfireteamelite", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVBaR8y2iYY", "date_published": "2021-07-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Aliens: Fireteam Elite Final Preview", "description": "We got hands on with over 8 hours of Aliens: Fireteam Elite and Phil Hornshaw gives his impressions on the game's first two campaigns.\n\nThe essential feeling of the movie Aliens is that everything is falling apart.\n\nAnd that's exactly what Aliens: Fireteam Elite is going for. You start out a confident Marine as you head into a xenomorph-infested facility, but slowly, you find yourself more and more overwhelmed as you fight through swarms of aliens. As ammo and medpacks get lower in key moments, you start to get a bit worried.\n\nThen, at the end of the mission, you're stuck standing in front of an elevator, knowing that as soon as you hit the button to call it and make your escape, the aliens will come for you. Even with full ammo and defensive tools like sentry guns and mines, you're about to be in a fight for your life.\u00a0\n\nIt's the aspect of Aliens, the 1986 James Cameron movie that most games based on the film struggle to capture, or miss altogether. In the movie, the Colonial Marines lose. They spend most of their time getting picked off, trying to defend against overwhelming odds, and running for their lives. In the eight or so hours of Aliens: Fireteam Elite we played in a preview build, the game did a pretty good job of distilling that sensation into a cooperative third-person shooter. No matter how well-equipped you are, you're going to find yourself starting to sweat as threats close in from all sides.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n01:20 - The Basic Structure & Aliens\n02:58 - Classes & Weapons\n04:24 - Locations & Story\n05:12 - Synthetics\n06:05 - Lore From The Alien Universe\n06:57 - Upgrades & Customization\n07:50 - Replay Value\n09:15 - Outro\n\n#aliens #aliensfireteam", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45SuKSiDZ0M", "date_published": "2021-07-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Battlefield V, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, The Ascent | Xbox Game Pass Show", "description": "Learn about what's new, what's leaving, and what you should be playing on Game Pass.
