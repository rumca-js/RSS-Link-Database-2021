ONS and COVID-19 reinfections, (June 29th)

Defining second infection

A new positive test 90 days or more after an initial first positive test

A new positive test following four consecutive negative tests

Rare 

Milder than initial infections

Rate of asymptomatics in first and second infections

Reinfected less likely to report symptoms

First infection
Asymptomatic 21.8%

Second infection
Asymptomatic 57.1%

COVID-19 Infection Survey

The strength of an infection is measured by a cycle threshold (Ct) value.

Positive results with a low Ct value (30 or less)
Episodes of infection with a higher viral load
More likely to be ill
More infectious

Positive results with a high Ct value (30 or more)
Indicate a lower viral load
Less likely to be ill
Less infectious

Initial infections
Most people, low Ct value (higher viral load)

Reinfections
High Ct value (lower viral load)

Freedom day, too simplistic

David Nabarro

We do have to be prepared for the inevitability that viruses will continue to be a problem for us

We’re going to have to really seriously contemplate continuing to practice some degree of physical distancing, some degree of mask wearing, some degree of hygiene, 

some degree of protecting those who are most at risk, as long as there are these nasty viruses around, whether or not we’re vaccinated

It makes people very angry because they want to be able to stop being careful but it’s my advice,

and it’s just based on studying these things over the years, is that it is not a cool thing just to ditch our preventative measures on a particular date because we hope that’s going to be associated with less risk - the risks are going to stay

UK Vaccine boosters in Autumn

All adults aged 50 and over

NHS and care staff

Anyone who qualifies for a flu jab

Prof Anthony Harnden, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation

we are worried about people who have had their vaccinations earlier on

We want to make sure they have a booster in time for the winter

We do know from other vaccines that immunity wanes quicker in older people than younger people

(Russia seems to be going for annual boosters)

I think Uefa's position is utterly irresponsible because we live in a time of a pandemic and in countries like Great Britain, where there’s a high incidence rate

it’s a foregone conclusion that this will drive the rate of infection
