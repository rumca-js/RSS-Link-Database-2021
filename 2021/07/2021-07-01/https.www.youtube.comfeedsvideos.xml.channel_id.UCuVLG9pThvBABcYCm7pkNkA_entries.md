Brands may not be leaders on social movements, but you'd never know it if you watched their commercials. FedEx recently pledged to go Net Zero Carbon, but their pledge leaves a lot to be desired. Watch as bonafide try-hard Rollie Williams (Columbia University - Climate Science & Policy) tries to untangle the web of legalese at the heart of the FedEx climate commitment. Is it any good? You be the judge.
