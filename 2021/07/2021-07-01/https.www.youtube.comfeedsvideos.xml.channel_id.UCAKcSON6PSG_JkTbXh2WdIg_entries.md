In March 2020, almost everyone else in show biz lost their livelihoods due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd in May. If you're a Minnesotan musician, holding it together hasn't been easy.

In the second episode of LineCheck, The Current's virtual conversation series, Sarah Souder Johnson interviewed musicians Annie Mack, Nazeem (Blood $moke Body), and Davina Lozier (Davina and the Vagabonds). Each artist talked about their experiences during the shutdown, their reshuffled priorities, and their gratitude for loved ones and music.

To open and close the evening, Mary Bue performed music from her album "The World Is Your Lover."
