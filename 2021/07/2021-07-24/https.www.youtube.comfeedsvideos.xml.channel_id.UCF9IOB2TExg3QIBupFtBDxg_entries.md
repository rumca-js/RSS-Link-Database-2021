Viral infection and transmission in a large well-traced outbreak caused by the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant

https://virological.org/t/viral-infection-and-transmission-in-a-large-well-traced-outbreak-caused-by-the-delta-sars-cov-2-variant/724

China, all 167 infections traced back to the first index case

N = 126

Daily sequential PCR testing of the quarantined subjects

Viral load, more than1000 times higher than that of the 19A/19B

Suggesting the potential faster viral replication rate and more infectiousness of the Delta variant at the early stage of the infection. 

Disease control measures, including the frequency of population testing, quarantine in pre-symptomatic phase and enhancing the genetic surveillance should be adjusted to account for the increasing prevalence of the Delta variant at global level.

Intra-family transmissions

Incubation period, 2020, 19A/19B strains

Exposure to first PCR positive, 6 days (IQR 5.00-8.00) days in the 2020 epidemic

Incubation period, 2021

4 days (IQR 3.00-5.00)

Relative viral loads, 2020, 19A/19B

(When SAS-CoV-2 viruses were firstly detected in hosts)

Ct value 34.31 (IQR 31.00~36.00)

Relative viral loads, 2021

Ct value 24.00 (IQR 19.00~29.00)

Delta variant infections,1260 times higher than the 19A/19B strains infections 


These data highlight that the Delta variant could be more infectious during the early stage of the infection.

Delta variant, exposure to the detection of viruses peaks at ~3.7 days

What we see is that the vaccine is less effective in preventing transmission, 

but itâ€™s easy to overlook that itâ€™s still very effective in preventing hospitalization and severe cases

Israel, protection against infection, 39%

Those vaccinated in January, 16% protection
Those vaccinated in February, 44% protection
Those vaccinated in March, 67% protection
Those vaccinated in April, 75% protection


Israel, protection against symptomatic disease, 41%
Those vaccinated in January, 16% protection
