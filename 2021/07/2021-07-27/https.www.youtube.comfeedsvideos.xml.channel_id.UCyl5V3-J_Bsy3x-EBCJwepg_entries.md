On The Babylon Bee Interview Show, Kyle and Ethan talk to Dr. Jeff Zweerink about aliens, accurate Sci-Fi movies, and being a scientist and a Christian. Dr. Jeff is a senior research scholar at Reasons To Believe. He holds a Ph.D. in Astrophysics and has debated Ken Ham on the age of the earth on the Unbelievable radio program. He struggled earlier in life with how to reconcile his biblical training and love for science. But when he first heard Hugh Ross, President & Founder of Reasons To Believe and an astrophysicist, speak at Iowa State University, Dr. Zweerink began to think he could combine science and faith together with his life‚Äôs work.
