US, CDC, fully vaccinated should resume wearing masks indoors

K-12 everyone wear masks indoors

Areas of high or substantial transmission, 63.5% of US

Fully vaccinated people can still catch and transmit the delta variant

100 million eligible people not vaccinated

Breakthrough infection

risk for SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated

people fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine are less likely than unvaccinated persons to acquire SARS-CoV-2 or to transmit it to others 

as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus

Onward transmission from vaccinated people (CDC)

Multiple studies in different countries

Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine

People who develop COVID-19 have a lower viral load, which

may indicate reduced transmissibility

Significantly reduced likelihood of transmission from vaccinated people to household contacts

US Vaccine efficacy

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html

US Protection against infection

Pfizer and Moderna, 86 to 89% protection against infection 

Asymptomatic infection, 80%

US Protection against hospitalization

All authorised vaccines give  more than 89% protection

Pfizer and Moderna, 96%

US Protection against death

All authorised vaccines, high protection

Israel

Infection, 92%

Symptomatic infection, 94%

Severe disease, 92%

Hospitalization, 87%

Vaccine-induced cellular immunity

Moderna or Pfizer vaccine recipients

Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Epsilon variants

CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses

Modest or no defects in cellular immune recognition of the variants

Cellular immunity may help limit disease severity

remain cautious

premature conclusions

This is still a dangerous disease

Test to release

Starts 16th August

Prof Neil Ferguson

Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies

The effect of vaccines is hugely reducing the risk of hospitalisations and death

And I'm positive that by late September or October time we will be looking back at most of the pandemic.

We will have Covid with us, we will still have people dying from Covid, but we'll have put the bulk of the pandemic behind us too early to tell

happy to be wrong

We're not completely out of the woods, but the equation has fundamentally changed

Clearly the higher we can get vaccination coverage, the better. That will protect people and reduce transmission - but there is going to be remaining uncertainty until the autumn
