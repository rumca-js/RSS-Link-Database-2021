This week, Mary Lucia talks about a new six-part documentary series on PBS called "Icon: Music Through the Lens." Given her love of rock-and-roll photography, Mary says, "It's essentially a documentary that was made for me."

The series features iconic photos from rock history right up to the present day, along with interviews with the photographers themselves on each individual's approach to the art of music photography. Providing additional insights are a number of musicians, too. 

Photographers interviewed include Jill Furmanovsky, Mick Rock, Danny Clinch, Michael Zagaris, Bruce Talamon, Kevin Westenberg, Terry O’Neill, Kevin Cummins, Bob Gruen, Rachael Wright, Deborah Feingold, Rankin, Laura Levine, Baron Wolman, Neal Preston, Janette Beckman, Roger Sargent, Pooneh Ghana, Christie Goodwin, Albert Watson and Lynn Goldsmith.

Sharing their insights from a musician’s point-of-view are Josh Homme (Queens of The Stone Age), Ziggy Marley, Lars Ulrich, (Metallica), Brett Anderson (Suede), Alice Cooper, Craig David, Nick Mason (Pink Floyd), Zara Larsson, Stefflon Don, Sharleen Spiteri (Texas), Nicky Wire (Manic Street Preachers), Matt Helders (Arctic Monkeys), Julian Lennon and Dizzee Rascal.

"Icon: Music Through the Lens" produced and directed by Dick Carruthers, and is airing now on PBS stations.
