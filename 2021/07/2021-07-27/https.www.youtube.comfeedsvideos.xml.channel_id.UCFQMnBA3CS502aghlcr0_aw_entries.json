After this story broke, Kay was kicked out of Faze along with several other members being suspended. \n\nToday I wanted to figure out, who was TRULY behind Save The Kids Token. Who designed Save The Kids? Who Created Save The Kids? Who changed the Anti-Whale code? Today, we get answers. \n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO: \nMutahar from SomeOrdinaryGamers\nBarely Sociable\n@iambookz on twitter for helping teach me birdlaw\n\nTHE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES AT\n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/coffeebreak_yt/\n\nCoffeezilla \ud83c\udfb6 Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMSQ1yoPT2c&list=PL4qw3AkxFDSNhEgawXD1j6r0iN1072XIB&index=1\n\nNOTE: This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam.
