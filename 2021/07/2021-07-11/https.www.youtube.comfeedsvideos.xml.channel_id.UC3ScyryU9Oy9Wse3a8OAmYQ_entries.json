Jones, sent shock and grief through that city\u2019s Black community.\n\nIn 1965, Jones, a trailblazing attorney in Louisville, was found dead, floating in the Ohio River \u2014 the victim of a murder that\u2019s still unsolved today. Thirty-four-year-old Jones was the city\u2019s first female prosecutor, and a charismatic fixture in the Black community, helping educate and register people to vote.\n\nDespite multiple investigations over nearly 60 years, there are no official motives or suspects in her killing. In 2018, her case was added to the federal government\u2019s cold case list and is one of the few that remains open.\n\nIn episode 4, James explores what an open case on the list looks like through the life and death of Alberta Jones \u2014 and talks to the person who never gave up fighting for answers.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

Here's What Led to the Shooting. | FRONTLINE", "description": "Bodycam footage obtained by The Salt Lake Tribune and FRONTLINE from the West Valley City Police in Utah, reveals what preceded a fatal, point-blank shooting of a handcuffed man \u2014 including the man\u2019s denied requests for psychiatric help, which have never before been reported.\n \nWARNING: This video contains graphic footage of a person being killed in police custody and strong language.\n \nIn the two years since Michael Chad Breinholt\u2019s August 23, 2019, shooting death, the public has only seen a sliver of what happened in bodycam footage released by police. Now, this video draws on newly obtained bodycam footage to paint a fuller picture of what happened, showing how the encounter that would lead to Breinholt\u2019s death began, and how officers\u2019 handling of him turned fatal. \n \nWhen police initially responded to a call about Breinholt, his girlfriend told police, \u201che told me he took, like, eight or nine pills,\u201d and said Breinholt told her \u201che took all those pills so he\u2019ll die.\u201dOver the course of the next two hours, while booking Breinholt on DUI charges, police denied his requests for psychiatric help \u2014 at one point, leaving him lying on the floor for more than 11 minutes while waiting for a medical team\u2019s review. Police did not inform the medics that he had taken pills possibly attempting to end his life.\n \nOfficers had already searched Breinholt for weapons, the footage reveals. But after a disoriented Breinholt began claiming he had a gun, an officer began grappling with him. Eventually, Breinholt was shot point-blank by police sergeant Tyler Longman while his hands were cuffed behind his back. One officer claimed Breinholt had grabbed his gun, although it was never removed from the holster. \n \n\u201cYou\u2019re about to die, my friend,\u201d Longman said prior to firing the fatal shot.\n \nThe West Valley City Police Department found Sergeant Longman's use of deadly force within policy. As of July 12, 2021, the district attorney has not filed any charges.\n \nThis is the third person Sergeant Longman has killed while on duty. The previous two shootings in 2007 and 2008 were ruled legally justified.\n \nThis reporting is part of FRONTLINE\u2019s partnership with The Salt Lake Tribune through the FRONTLINE Local Journalism Initiative.
