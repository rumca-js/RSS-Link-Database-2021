Episodes will be released monthly with early access on YouTube available via YouTube Memberships.\n\nThis pilot episode will serve as an introduction to the cast, format, and visual style and allow you to provide us with some feedback that we can incorporate into the start of the official campaign. The start of the official campaign will feature a lot more animation and the beginning of an original Dungeons & Dragons campaign created by Jack. If it goes well, the longer-term plan is to do more limited series with new campaigns, characters, and more.\n\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of fun building Adventure Is Nigh! and hope you enjoy this introductory episode with more to come later this summer.\n\nJoin YouTube Memberships and support our content for Early Access to new videos, exclusive Discord perks & more for just $2 per month \u25ba\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqg5FCR7NrpvlBWMXdt-5Vg/join\n\nSubscribe to Escapist Magazine! \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/Sub2Escapist\n\nWant to see the next episode a week early?
