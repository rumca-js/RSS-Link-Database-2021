LineCheck is a series of virtual conversations with Minnesota's music community, and because the conversations are centered on music and the music industry, the sessions naturally open and close with music.

Here are two songs by Sounds of Blackness, recorded specially for LineCheck episode 4, "Minnesota's Music Activists." Representing Sounds of Blackness with two of the group's recent singles are vocalists Melissa Belfrey and Lacey Dreamz. Belfrey and Dreams provide lead vocals on "Sick & Tired," a song inspired by the words of Civil Rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, and "Time for Reparations," Sounds of Blackness's latest single. "Protest music has always been a part of Sounds of Blackness repertoire," says music director Gary Hines. "It is currently and always will be."

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Sick & Tired"
4:01 "Time for Reparations"
