That's a lot to live up to, but thankfully after 5 hours of hands-on time with the game, the game is shaping up to be an ambitious and mature take on its predecessor, while still honoring what made the first one so special all those years ago.\n\nIn the above video, Kurt Indovina details his time with the preview version, going over its writing, gameplay, and level design. Like the original, it's bursting with studio Double Fine's unhinged creativity, and director Tim Schafer's signature writing and charm.\n\nThe game is expected to release on August 25 for PC, PS4, and will be available day one on Game Pass for Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n#Psychonauts2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL_I_Yhjlso", "date_published": "2021-07-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Tom Clancy's XDEFIANT Announcement Trailer", "description": "Check out the all new Tom Clancy's XDEFIANT Trailer developed by Ubisoft.
