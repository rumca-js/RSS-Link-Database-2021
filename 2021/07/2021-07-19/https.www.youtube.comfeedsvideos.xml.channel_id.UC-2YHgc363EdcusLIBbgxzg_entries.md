Up to 70% of amputees claim to feel pain in their missing limbs, and we're still not completely sure why. Some of the theories range from nerve damage to crossed wires in the brain to a redrawing of the mind's map. And some new therapies involving simple mirror illusions and cutting edge technology are helping amputees live less painful lives. And it's also making us question the very nature of reality.
