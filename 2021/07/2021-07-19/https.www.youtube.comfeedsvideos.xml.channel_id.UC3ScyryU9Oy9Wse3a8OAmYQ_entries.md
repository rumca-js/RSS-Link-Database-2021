“I grew up in the war,” Quraishi says in the film. “I have seen everything with my own eyes, but this time is more and more dangerous than the past.”

In this excerpt, Quraishi explores what's happening to the Hazara Shia minority living in Afghanistan as the U.S. withdraws, the Sunni Taliban advances, and the Shia power Iran works to extend its influence.
