Raiders of the Lost Ark is 40 years old this June.

It is a masterpiece. It was the highest-grossing movie of the year at the domestic box office. It was nominated for Best Picture and won more Oscars than any other movie that year. New York Times critic Vincent Canby described it as “an instant classic.” That appeal has not diminished with age. It was added to the National Film Registry in 1999. Just last summer, readers of The Los Angeles Times named Raiders of the Lost Ark “the ultimate summer movie.”
