They were among the greatest creatures in the history of Arda - Great Eagles that aided the elves and men of Middle-earth in times of peril against the two dark lords. Today, we cover the eagles throughout the first, second, and third ages. From Beleriand, to Numenor, to Middle-earth, the great eagles rescued allies, fought dragons, waged war, and remained loyal servants of Manwe, the Lord of the Valar.
