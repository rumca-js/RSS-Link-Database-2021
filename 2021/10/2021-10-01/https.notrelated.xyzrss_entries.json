[{"source": "https://notrelated.xyz/rss", "title": "Myth as Science and Prehistoric Knowledge: Hamlet's Mill", "description": "<p>Known history is less than 1% of the time humans have inhabited earth, and thus most of our past survives only in the partial evidence of myth, genetics and badly decayed archaeological remains. In particular, mythology is not just a collection of arbitrary stories, but as the authors of <em>Hamlet's Mill</em> argue, it is a long-lost theoretical language used to store astronomical and scientific knowledge.</p><p>While we all know that myth can store relevant information in a memorable format, it can also embed very specific details of a preexisting system of knowledge also attested in archaeoastronomy, even in well-known sites like Stonehenge, the \"neolithic calculator\" which shows astronomical knowledge far more precise than that of any average person of today.</p><p>The reason the earliest philosophical and religious mythology seems absurd or opaque to us is partially because it is speaking in a jargon which has been lost, like alchemy or primeval sciences. In the right context, we can see a long tradition of knowledge preserved from at least the Stone Age.</p><details>\ud83d\udcda See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><em>Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth</em> (Giorgio de Santillana &amp; Hertha von Dechend)</li><li><em>The Origins of Scientific Thought: from Anazimander to Proclus, 600 B.C. to 300 A.D.</em>  (Giorgio de Santillanna)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/2021258a0\">Stonehenge: A Neolithic Computer</a> (Gerald Hawkins)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CdeBmQZ2QiCEnPQn5KQ6ov\">Learn the Ancient Babylonian Math System!</a> (YouTube video series)</li></ul></details><h1>Timecodes</h1><pre>0:00:00\tIssuing an Extension on Human Prehistory\n0:02:24\tAn Argument from Plausibility for R*ddit Soyentists\n0:05:17\tConstant Emergence of Civilization\n0:06:31\tMyth as the Science of Prehistory\n0:07:44\tI hate Hamlet's Mill.\n0:10:12\tWhich came first: the Planets or the Gods?\n0:11:50\tAstronomical Myths in India and the Vedic Tradition\n0:15:28\tOn Al-Biruni and his bad pronunciation\n0:18:00\tMythology as technical language\n0:20:40\tHamlet's Mill and the Precession of the Equinox\n0:23:15\tHamlet and his story and Cosmic Mill\n0:27:15\tHyperdiffusionism\n0:30:24\tDonations https://donate.notrelated.xyz\n0:31:21\tOn podcast length and density again\n0:33:15\tWhy .ogg instead of .mp3?\n0:36:08\tThor Heyerdahl\n0:38:40\tThe Polynesian discovery of America, physical and genetic evidence\n0:43:16\tAboriginal Australians discover America in prehistory.\n0:50:20\tOn Denisovans and Homo erectus\n0:51:55\tDiversion on Solutreans in Europe\n0:53:50\tOn alchemy and technical language\n0:56:19\tHipparchus and Babylonian astronomy\n0:57:25\tAncient Memes we use every day\n0:59:50\tHow many degrees are in a circle?\n1:01:20\tBabylonian Math https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CdeBmQZ2QiCEnPQn5KQ6ov\n1:03:51\tFull development of science in prehistory\n1:04:25\tPanini's Ashtadhyayi and its deductive predecessors\n1:06:52\tThe Memory Code by Lynne Kelly\n1:08:41\tThe Cosmos and Ancient Astronomy\n1:09:49\tStonehenge as a Neolithic Calculator\n1:12:25\tPoverty Point\n1:13:12\tClosing on the Precession of the Equinoxes</pre><h1>More...</h1><ul><li>The <em>Not Related!</em> website: <a href=\"https://notrelated.xyz\"></a>notrelated.xyz</a></li><li>Donations will be read in the middle of each episode: <a href=\"https://donate.notrelated.xyz\">donate.notrelated.xyz</a></li></ul>", "link": "https://notrelated.xyz/audio/s02/S02E04_-_Myth_as_Science_and_Prehistoric_Knowledge_Hamlets_Mill.ogg", "date_published": "2021-10-01 04:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
