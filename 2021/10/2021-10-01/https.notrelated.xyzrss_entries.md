<p>Known history is less than 1% of the time humans have inhabited earth, and thus most of our past survives only in the partial evidence of myth, genetics and badly decayed archaeological remains. In particular, mythology is not just a collection of arbitrary stories, but as the authors of <em>Hamlet's Mill</em> argue, it is a long-lost theoretical language used to store astronomical and scientific knowledge.</p><p>While we all know that myth can store relevant information in a memorable format, it can also embed very specific details of a preexisting system of knowledge also attested in archaeoastronomy, even in well-known sites like Stonehenge, the "neolithic calculator" which shows astronomical knowledge far more precise than that of any average person of today.</p><p>The reason the earliest philosophical and religious mythology seems absurd or opaque to us is partially because it is speaking in a jargon which has been lost, like alchemy or primeval sciences. In the right context, we can see a long tradition of knowledge preserved from at least the Stone Age.</p><details>ðŸ“š See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><em>Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth</em> (Giorgio de Santillana &amp; Hertha von Dechend)</li><li><em>The Origins of Scientific Thought: from Anazimander to Proclus, 600 B.C. to 300 A.D.</em>  (Giorgio de Santillanna)</li><li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/2021258a0">Stonehenge: A Neolithic Computer</a> (Gerald Hawkins)</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CdeBmQZ2QiCEnPQn5KQ6ov">Learn the Ancient Babylonian Math System!</a> (YouTube video series)</li></ul></details><h1>Timecodes</h1><pre>0:00:00	Issuing an Extension on Human Prehistory
