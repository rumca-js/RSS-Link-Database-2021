In today’s GameSpot News, Konami might be working on new Metal Gear, Silent Hill, and Castlevania games, the PS5 now has an 8K game but with a catch, and the Stranger of Paradise demo is out now.

In this video, Persia talks about a recent report of Konami making new installments and remakes in some of its franchises such as Metal Gear, Castlevania, and Silent Hill. All of these new projects are said to be announced in 2022. 

Persia also goes over the only game to currently offer 8K on PS5, except there’s a catch. While The Touryst renders internally at 8K resolution, the PS5 doesn't actually support that output over HDMI 2.1 and the developer Shin'en Multimedia is using an extreme supersampling technique to downsample every pixel on any connected 4K TV. 

Lastly, Team Ninja's new Final Fantasy game, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, will launch in March 2022. A second demo is now available for PS5 and Xbox Series X and S.

In this New World beginner’s guide, we give tips for fast leveling, making the most of gear in and out of combat, as well as how to make the most of trade skills.   

New World is an MMORPG from Amazon Games set on the mythical island of Aeternum. For thousands of years explorers have ventured to the island in search of its mysterious resource known as Azoth. This substance grants power and eternal life but often at a cost and has led to the corruption of the island as well as the island’s former masters to nearly go extinct. 

In this video, DeVante talks about all the important things a beginner should know about New World before they start playing. He breaks down ways to maximize XP gain in order to level up faster as well as how to cut down on travel time in games. Later in the video, DeVante details New World’s combat, weapons, damage types and armor sets as well as discussing tips for trade skills like gathering and crafting.  

New World released for PC on September 28, 2021 and is now available via Amazon or Steam.

## Stranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin Hands-On Preview

We played the second demo for Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, which shows off the game's extensive job system and takes players to a new mission.

One of the most notable and exciting things about Final Fantasy VII Remake was the way it updated the original game's combat system, merging the feeling of menu-based commands and action game controls. Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin does something similar with a take on the jobs system that's a big part of Final Fantasy's history. The ability to switch between combat roles on the fly allows for a whole lot of interesting versatility, adding tactical considerations to protagonist Jack's angry shouting, slashing, and headbutting.

We recently got a chance to go hands-on with the second playable demo of Stranger of Paradise ahead of its release. This new look at the game includes everything that was in the first demo, with some added story context. It also included another section that gives a sense of Final Fantasy Origins' take on the series and how expansive the job system really is, as well as how the gear systems and mission-based approach seem like they'll work on a large scale.
