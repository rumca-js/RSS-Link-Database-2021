Thanks to ASUS ROG for sponsoring this video series! We're no longer accepting entries, thank you to EVERYONE who entered.

We know building a PC can be both confusing and, most importantly, very expensive, especially these days. So we're partnering up once again with ASUS ROG to fly 3 lucky winners to build a PC at Linus Media Group HQ with Linus Sebastian! Good luck!

The contest is only available to residents of the United States of American and Canada. 

Last year's winners for inspiration!
