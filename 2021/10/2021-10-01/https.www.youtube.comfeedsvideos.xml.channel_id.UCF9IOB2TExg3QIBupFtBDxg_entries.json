implications for mandatory vaccination\n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2101\n\nUS as of 11th December 2020\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20210115184811/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html\n\nUS, Natural infection, Feb 2020 to May 2021\n\n0 \u2013 17    26.8 / 73

after infection\n\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf4063\n\nN = 254 blood samples post infection\n\nN = 51 long term follow up\n\nAntibodies against SARSCoV-\n2 spike and receptor binding domain\n(RBD) declined moderately over 8 months\n\nMemory B cells against SARS-CoV-2 spike \nincreased between 1 month and 8 months\nafter infection. \n\nProportion of subjects positive for CD4+ T cells (92%) remained high at 6 to 8 months after infection.\n\nThe different types of immunememory each had distinct kinetics, resulting in complex interrelationships over time\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSubstantial immune memory is generated after COVID-19\n\nAbout 95% of subjects retained immune memory at ~6 months after infection\n\nCirculating antibody titers were not predictive of T cell memory\n\nCDC \n\nStill recommends a full vaccination dose for all\n\nthe immune response from vaccination is more predictable\n\nantibody responses after infection vary widely by individual\n\nJune, Peter Marks, Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nWe do know that the immunity after vaccination is better than the immunity after natural infection\n\ngenerally the immunity after natural infection tends to wane after about 90 days\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j8ziaOpl7o&t=1724s\n\nIt appears from the literature that natural infection provides immunity, \n\nbut that immunity is seemingly not as strong and may not be as long lasting as that provided by the vaccine\n\nUK covid pass
