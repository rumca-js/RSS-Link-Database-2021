This is called aspiration.\n\nRationale for aspirating\n\nvaccine could be inadvertently delivered into the blood rather than the muscle tissue. \n\nBut as the flashback of blood hardly ever happens, the practice was abandoned by many practitioners. \n\nI have not seen any evidence to support the rejection of this hypothesis at this stage. \n\nThe animal model study supports the possibility that inadvertent injection into a blood vessel could result in undesirable reactions. \n\nHowever, the majority of myocarditis cases are occurring in young males after the second dose, something that this hypothesis does not explain.\n\nMy conclusion is that this requires more research and observing the patterns of post-vaccine myocarditis among populations where aspiration is practiced could be helpful.\n\nCommon sense in Denmark\n\nhttps://en.ssi.dk/news/epi-news/2021/no-19-21---2021\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Janssen\n\nA single 0.5 mL dose of undiluted vaccine is given.\n\nBased on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before injection.\n\nDownload John's two comprehensive but free educational text books or make a donation to the campbellteaching project using this link: http://159.69.48.3", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXcddiS32s0", "date_published": "2021-10-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Mass loss of trust", "description": "Is there a crisis of trust?\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus\n\nJohn's free textbooks\n\nDownload my two comprehensive but free educational text books or make a donation to the campbellteaching project using this link: http://159.69.48.3Russia\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijgNJpUes4Y\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10084049/Video-showing-Putin-coughing-meeting-emerges-forced-deny-having-Covid-19.html\n\nInfections, + 29,409\n\nDeaths, + 973 = 217,000\n\nDelta variant\n\nVaccine hesitancy\n\nFirst dose, 33%\n\nRolled out before trials\n\nProblem is not that bad\n\nGovernment had won the war on covid-19\n\nMr. Putin pulls out of G20 meeting due to 'diary clash'\n\nTwo doses of Sputnik V\n\nITU, 8,000 patients\n\nPatients becoming critical in 3 to 4 days\n\nVaccination passports cost 70 euros\n\nWidespread public misconceptions\n\nHygiene rules hardly followed\n\nLimited restrictions\n\nLimited mask wearing\n\nOfficial information not believed\n\nIndian summer just now\n\nMoscow may well cope\n\nNew infectious disease hospital\n\nRegions, hospitals already full\n\nMolnupiravir, Merck, awaiting EMU\n\nUS government at $700 (\u00a3515) per course\n\nAnalysts at Harvard School of Public Health and King's College Hospital in London have found it costs just $17.74 (\u00a313) to produce.\n\nDespite this, Merck and Ridgeback could earn $7 billion in profits by the end of the year.\n\nhttps://news.sky.com/story/covid-news-uk-latest-live-experts-discover-why-people-get-covid-toes-as-wales-introduces-vaccine-passports-12425651\n\nhttps://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/merck-molnupiravir-blockbuster-covid-19-pandemic-endemic-oral-antivirals-market\n\nThat\u2019s about $700 per course.
