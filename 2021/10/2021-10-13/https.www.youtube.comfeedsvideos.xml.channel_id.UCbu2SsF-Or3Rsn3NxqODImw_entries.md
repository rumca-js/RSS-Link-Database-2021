## Battlefield 2042 Hazard Zone Explained

Hazard Zone is a Battlefield 2042's high stakes game mode that releases alongside All-Out-Warfare and Portal. It involves squads landing on a map, hunting down Data Drives, and extracting. 

Battlefield 2042 will release on November 19 and will most notably not include a battle royale mode at launch. Instead developer DICE is focusing on a new competitive squad-based game type called Hazard Zone that focuses on multiple four person squads moving around a map and competing to collect Data Drives and get them to extraction points. As opposed to much larger player counts in popular battle royale titles, this game type will have 24 players (six total teams) on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and 32 players (eight total teams) on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. 

Hazard Zone does seem to draw plenty of elements from battle royale titles, such as the ability to spawn downed teammates back at Reinforcement Uplink points or using a Tactical Upgrade. Hazard Zone will be playable on all launch maps from All-Out-Warfare and will occasionally incorporate extreme weather such as tornadoes. Another large element to Hazard Zone will be squad makeup. Players can't use more than one of the same Specialist on their team encouraging teams to work together and rely on different Specialists throughout each match. Having mobility with an operator like Sundance might provide a key advantage during a different phase of the match in comparison to Falck's healing, for example. There is a ton more to know about Hazard Zone, including phases, currencies, tactical upgrades, and how to maximize points. Make sure to watch this video for the full breakdown.

## Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl Look To Evolve Upon The Originals' Mechanics

The remakes for Pokémon Generation IV seem to be aimed at addressing Diamond/Pearl's most obvious shortcomings.

Ahead of the release for Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, developer ILCA and publisher Nintendo have marketed the two remakes as faithful adaptations of the original Generation IV games. I recently attended a preview event for the duo where I got to see B. Diamond in action, and although these remakes look faithful to the original games, I'm not so sure that they'll feel as faithful. If anything, the changes made in these remakes seem to make for a far more approachable experience--I think players are going to find these games to be a lot easier to get through than the original Diamond/Pearl.

In terms of overall structure and presentation, yes, B. Diamond/S. Pearl are faithful adaptations of the original Diamond/Pearl. Unlike Sword/Shield with its over-the-shoulder perspective, realistically proportioned characters, and occasional free camera moments, B. Diamond/S. Pearl is presented in Pokemon's traditional top-down isometric perspective with a more chibi-like visual style and no free camera.
