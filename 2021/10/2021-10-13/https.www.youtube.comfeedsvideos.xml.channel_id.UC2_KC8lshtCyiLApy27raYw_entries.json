Things I\u2019ve discussed at length before, and will discuss at length in the future. Today, I don\u2019t talk about it too long. Like 8 minutes or so. \n\nAnyway, here\u2019s the vid I mention at the start;\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7QPnFPzNgQ&t=3s\n\nI wanna get more vids out on this channel, just been busy with Whimsu stuff.
