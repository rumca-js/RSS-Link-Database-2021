Indeed, there is peer-reviewed work showing in mice that possibly intravenous injection of mRNA vaccine leads to myocardial inflammation. 

that intravenous injection of adenoviral vector based vaccine (AZ1222, ChAdOx1) leads to thrombocytopenia and platelet-directed immune responses,
 
offering a possible explanation for vaccine-induced thrombosis/thrombocytopenia

these data might indicate a simple measure to lower the incidence of vaccine-induced side effects, 

There is a lack of data on frequency and effects of IV injection in humans. 

Most likely, two approaches are needed to further validate the data: 

Large animal studies

Studies comparing incidence of vaccine-associated thrombosis/thrombocytopenia/ myocarditis in countries with mandated syringe aspiration to countries that don’t mandate this practice.

Thrombocytopenia and splenic platelet directed immune responses after intravenous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration (29th June 2021)

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.29.450356v1

Recently a rare and novel complication of SARS-CoV-2 targeted adenovirus vaccines has emerged: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). 

we employ in vitro and in vivo models

to characterize the possible mechanisms of this platelet-targeted autoimmunity. 

We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation. 

After intravenous injection, these aggregates are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen and platelet remnants are found in the spleen.

This is followed by a pronounced B-cell response with the emergence of circulating antibodies binding to platelets.

Our work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS. 

Hence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, 

could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.

There are a range of injection techniques for administering vaccines, 

Injecting fast and withdrawing the needle

Injecting slowly before withdrawing

Pulling back on the plunger, seeing there is no blood, then injecting. This is called aspiration.

Rationale for aspirating

vaccine could be inadvertently delivered into the blood rather than the muscle tissue. 

But as the flashback of blood hardly ever happens, the practice was abandoned by many practitioners. 

I have not seen any evidence to support the rejection of this hypothesis at this stage. 

The animal model study supports the possibility that inadvertent injection into a blood vessel could result in undesirable reactions. 

However, the majority of myocarditis cases are occurring in young males after the second dose, something that this hypothesis does not explain.

My conclusion is that this requires more research and observing the patterns of post-vaccine myocarditis among populations where aspiration is practiced could be helpful.

COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen

A single 0.5 mL dose of undiluted vaccine is given.

Based on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before injection.

Coronavirus: lessons learned to date 

https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/7496/documents/78687/default/

in 2020 the UK did significantly worse in terms of covid deaths than many countries—especially compared to those in East Asia

The UK’s pandemic planning was too narrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model which failed to learn the lessons from SARS, MERS and Ebola. 

In the first three months the strategy reflected official scientific advice to the Government which was accepted and implemented. 

When the Government moved from the ‘contain’ stage to the ‘delay’ stage, 

that approach involved trying to manage the spread of covid through the population rather than to stop it spreading altogether. 

This amounted in practice to accepting that herd immunity by infection was the inevitable outcome, 

The UK, along with many other countries in Europe and North America made a serious early error in adopting this fatalistic approach 

and not considering a more emphatic and rigorous approach to stopping the spread of the virus as adopted by many East and South East Asian countries. 

The fact that the UK approach reflected a consensus between official scientific advisers and the Government indicates a degree of groupthink 

that was present at the time which meant we were not as open to approaches being taken elsewhere as we should have been.
