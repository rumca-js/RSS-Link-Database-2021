LYRICS
We were going to Indian Rock
It’s a forty-five minute walk
And they say when you reach the top
There’s nothin’ but blue

So we talked about Elon Musk
And then suddenly it was dusk
Would you leave me here in the dust
If he asked you to

Well if you go to Mars
I hope you pack your guitar
Yeah if you go to Mars
I think they’ll need a superstar

Yeah I know that this world ain’t much
And that humans are out of touch
But it’s all that I’ve ever loved
So I’m stayin’ put

But when you get to the Red Rock
Take a forty-five minute walk
Write a song about feelin’ lost
Cause that’s all we can do

Yeah if you go to Mars
I hope you pack your guitar
Yeah if you go to Mars
I know they’ll need a superstar
Oh if you go to Mars
I hope you pack your guitar
Oh if you go to Mars
I know you’ll be an indie rock star

We were going to Indian Rock
It’s a forty-five minute walk
And they say when you reach the top
There’s nothin’ but blue
