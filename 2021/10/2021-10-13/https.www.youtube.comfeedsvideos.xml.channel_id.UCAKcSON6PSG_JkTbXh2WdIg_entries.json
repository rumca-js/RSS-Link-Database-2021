Born Oct. 13, 1941, in Newark, N.J., the singer-songwriter turns 80 today. Simon found much success as half of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, formed in 1956 with childhood pal Art Garfunkel, but he ventured out on his own in 1970 and would go on to find decades of more success as a solo artist. Simon has earned 16 Grammy awards for his solo and collaborative work, including three for Album of the Year (\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" and \"Graceland\"), and a Lifetime Achievement Award. He is a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 first in 1990 as a member of Simon & Garfunkel and again in 2001 for his solo career.\n\nIn November 2019, Paul Simon performed on an episode of Live From Here, recorded live at the Town Hall in New York City. Watch three performances from that program.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Questions For The Angels\"\n4:42 \"American Tune\"\n8:54 \"Kodachrome\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nPaul Simon \u2013 vocals, guitar\nChris Thile \u2013 mandolin, vocals\nAna\u00efs Mitchell \u2013 vocals\nMike Elizondo \u2013 bass\nAlex Hargreaves \u2013 fiddle\nArmand Hirsch \u2013 guitar\nJon Cowherd \u2013 keys\nEric Doob \u2013 percussion\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Ben Miller; American Public Media\nAudio: Sam Hudson; American Public Media\nProduction: Jeffy Hnilicka; Tom Campbell; American Public Media\n\nFIND MORE:\n2021 Today in Music History: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2021/10/13/today-in-music-history-happy-birthday-paul-simon\n2018 Rock and Roll Book Club: Robert Hilburn's 'Paul Simon: The Life': https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/05/29/paul-simon-life-robert-hilburn\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#paulsimon", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoqHeJwcITM", "date_published": "2021-10-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Listen to Looch: 'Return to Skid Row' sheds fresh light on lost Minneapolis community", "description": "This week, Mary Lucia has something for those fascinated by the history of Minneapolis: \"Return To Skid Row,\" a Twin Cities PBS Original production.\n\nAt the film's core is \"Skid Row,\" a color film shot on a 16 mm movie camera by bar owner and amateur photographer John Bacich between the years 1955 and 1961. The footage was shot with no sound, yet Bacich provides his own narration \u2014 and because Bacich was part of the community, he knows several of the people on camera by name. \n\nIn \"Return to Skid Row,\" Bacich's original footage is bookended by commentary from  authors James Eli Shiffer and Stewart Van Cleve, and University of Minnesota professor Brenda Child. Mary Lucia's takeaway from this commentary is \"you can knock down buildings, and you can gentrify certain things. But what you're what you're trying to do is get rid of a community \u2014 and it may be unsavory \u2014 but it was nonetheless a community of people.\" \n\n\"Return to Skid Row\" is available for streaming on PBS.org as well as on the TPT Originals YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/w-o79czcfKE\n\nFind the complete Listen to Looch playlist here:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYClJc3TpV5J_sXyCfes-p6vCgOpCmleh\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#minneapolishistory #tptoriginals #marylucia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBnQ2bXFC9g", "date_published": "2021-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "White Reaper - three songs at The Current (2019)", "description": "Two years ago this week, Louisville, Ky., rockers White Reaper visited The Current studio.

Two years on, White Reaper are dipping their toes back in the touring pool, and they're set to play the Shaky Knees Festival in Atlanta on October 22.
