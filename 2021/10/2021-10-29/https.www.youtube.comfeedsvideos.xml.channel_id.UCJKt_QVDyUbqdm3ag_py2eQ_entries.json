More info below.\n\nFrom actual demos or musicdisks using A500 r6a (so no DeliTracker playback here). Spacy from Orchestral Delight (1991, Taipan^The Time Circle), the rest from Expressions (1989, The Time Circle). We lose some clarity against A1200, but we gain playback accuracy. A1200 had problems with Visor at least (drum part at the end plays wrong, don't ask why), which means i couldn't trust it with any Zzzax Soundmon playback. And looks like these are from about 1989, which means A500 is the more period accurate machine for these anyways. I prefer these to any of my earlier uploads from Zzzax for sure.\n\n00:00 Spacy\n04:04 Voyage\n07:19 Expressions (original 1985 \"Le Parc (L.A. - Streethawk)\" by Tangerine Dream)\n09:45 Selector\n10:09 No Mercy\n14:01 New Dimension\n18:19 Pulstarmix (original 1976 \"Pulstar\" by Vangelis)\n20:51 Synthdrum\n24:05 Visor\n\nVisit my channel for more Amiga music.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIfKMQJPLgk", "date_published": "2021-10-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
