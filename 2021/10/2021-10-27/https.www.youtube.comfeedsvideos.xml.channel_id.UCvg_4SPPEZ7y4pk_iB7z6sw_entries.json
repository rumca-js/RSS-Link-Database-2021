The CDI, the PS5, and some stuff in between. \n\nIt's every major console, not EVERY console. Kinda hard to fit that into a title.\n\nI'll be looking at the visual elements moreso than practicality, because in that case the modern consoles would win everything.\n\nInstead, think of this more of the \"aesthetic\".\n\nPSTV is gonna look like the Vita, the N-Gage isn't on here, and no alternative or secret menus. Didn't wanna make this vid an hour long.\n\nI probably missed a few, but ya know.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WhimsuHubTy\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/user-503704039\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/theknowledgehub\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-KL04Ra6E1Du0pFawN4pWg\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3STpe...\n\n\nAdditional Footage Credits:\nJason's Macintosh Museum\nBlendtec's Will It Blend?\nGreenskull\nangrydinosauruk\nDeadlySoulStealer374\nchaoreturnsforgood76\nNervi\nWhyNotVideo211\nPeyton\nFantastic Mr Foxbox\nS\u00e9bastien Angulo\nKaian Sanders-Bird alt\nDebstool 2\nPureisuteeshonTsu\nJakub Pomeranian\nVideoRanger1990\npacthesir - The Random Video Channel\n83Chrisaaron\ngumgum99\nAscension Peasant\nRandomUser_101\nchaoreturnsforgood76\nCasper Wong\nMitchell Camps\nKatTheLavaGirl\nRocket Sloth\nspllitz\nTom Warren\nDiamondGamerPro\nNintendo\nPlayingWithMahWii\ncobanermani456\nPuRexCrEaSe\nProdigious\nDigital Foundry\nXbox On", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2RhS-MfLjo", "date_published": "2021-10-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
