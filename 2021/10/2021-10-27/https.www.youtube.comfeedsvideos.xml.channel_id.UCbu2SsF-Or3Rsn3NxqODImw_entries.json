Apex Legends: Escape introduces the new battle royale map called Storm Point, Ash who is the newest legend, and the C.A.R. SMG which is also a new weapon. A variety of other changes are also coming to other weapons, legends, and the ranked playlist.\n\nStorm Point is the fourth and largest battle royale map to be added to Apex Legends and the first to be developed after the release of the game. There will be 15% more playable space on Storm Point, natural wildlife that can attack you, and gravity cannons to boost you around the map. \n\nAsh will provide exclusive intel to her and her squad with her passive that can scan deathboxes to find its attackers and slow enemies down with her tactical Arc Tether. Ash's ultimate is called dPhase Breach and it creates a one-way portal that can help your team get in or out of fights quickly.\n\nThe C.A.R. SMG is a hybrid weapon that can use both light and heavy ammo and attachments. This helps with inventory management and gives you a wider variety of loot options.\n\nThere are also changes to Wattson and overall weapon balancing for season 11's arsenal. Ranked playlists will also see changes to their point system to make games more rewarding for those who obtain kills and get kills on opponents of a higher rank. \n\nTimestamps:\nIntro - 00:00\nStorm Point - 00:21\nAsh - 02:35\nWattson - 05:03\nC.A.R.

Call Of Duty: Vanguard\u2019s install sizes are reportedly 30%-50% smaller at launch than previous games in the series on PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a small install--it'll still require 56 to 93 gigs free, depending on the system. It might finally be time for you to uninstall Modern Warfare or Cold War to make space. Don\u2019t forget to plan for more Warzone installs when the new Pacific map launches.\u00a0\n\nBlizzard's is still seeing the fallout of toxic workplace allegations against it, with the latest developments being the cancellation of BlizzCon this year, and Overwatch character McCree's name changing to Cole Cassidy. McCree previously carried the name of an employee who was ousted from the company amid sexual harassment and discrimination allegations at Activision Blizzard. To go along with Cole's new name, players can now change their BattleTags for Battle.net for free for a limited time.\u00a0\nFinally, Division 2 post-launch content has been delayed to February 2022 and Nintendo and Niantic have announced their next mobile app, Pikmin Bloom, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of Nintendo's nature-based franchise.\n\nTo find out what you need to know tomorrow, head on over to GameSpot.com and YouTube.com/Gamespot for more news.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBGkQYNJmKc", "date_published": "2021-10-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mario Party Superstars - N64 vs. Switch Graphics Comparison", "description": "With Mario Party Superstars bringing back boards and minigames from the N64 titles, we put Mario Party 2 head-to-head with Superstars to see the graphical differences.\n\nMario Party Superstars is the newest entry in the Mario Party series, and with it, five classic boards from the Nintendo 64 titles return. Those five boards are Peach\u2019s Birthday Cake and Yoshi\u2019s Tropical Island from the original Mario Party, Space Land and Horror Land from Mario Party 2 (which are showcased in this video), and Woody Woods from Mario Party 3. Superstars also contains 100 minigames from across the entire series, including the GameCube, Wii, and Wii U entries.\u00a0\n\nA few things to note about this video: The original version of Mario Party 2 is an N64 game, but the capture used in this video is the N64 version running on Wii U Virtual Console, while Mario Party Superstars was captured on a Nintendo Switch. Also, Mario Party 2 is running at 30fps, while Mario Party Superstars runs at 60fps, so you\u2019ll notice one is smoother than the other.\n\nMario Party Superstars releases for Nintendo Switch on October 29, 2021. As of right now, the N64 Mario Party games are not scheduled to be released as a part of Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online, but hopefully some of them will be in the future.

Nintendo Switch Online has released a bunch of N64 titles that you can play on the go, such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and there have been some issues with the games. The largest problem is button mapping, with the N64\u2019s six buttons having to be laid over the Nintendo Switch controller, which only has four. That is creating awkward and, for some, unplayable control schemes for titles such as Sin and Punishment. Some games also lack features that used to be available using the N64 controller pack, which was a device inserted into the older controller that acted as a memory card. That means the games are seeing missing functionality, such as the ability to race against your own ghost driver in Mario Kart 64.\u00a0\n\nA Quiet Place is becoming a single-player, story-driven horror game. Paramount\u2019s movie about a family trapped in a future where aliens hunt down anyone who makes a sound is now being adapted into a game by Saber Interactive, iLLOGIKA, and EP1T0ME. The development team has also pulled in employees who worked on Rainbow Six and Far Cry. The story will not focus on the family seen in the movie, but instead will tell its own story. If there\u2019s one thing we learned from the movie, it\u2019s that you should definitely go chasing waterfalls\u2026 if you want to have any conversations with other characters, anyway.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPhasmophobia is releasing a huge \u201cNightmare\u201d update for Halloween, and it includes the new Maple Lodge Campsite map. There are four new ghost types as well: Onryo, The Twins, Obake, and Raiju, which players will run into more frequently during the Halloween event. The update also adds weather, Nightmare-level difficulty, mini-map changes, and balance tweaks.\nFinally, if you dropped off of Far Cry 6, the game might have something to say about it. Players have reported getting emails from antagonist Anton Castillo telling them they can do better.
