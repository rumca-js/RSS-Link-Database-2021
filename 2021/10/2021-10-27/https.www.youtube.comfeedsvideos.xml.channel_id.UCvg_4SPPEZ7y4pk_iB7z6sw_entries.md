I review game console menus today. The CDI, the PS5, and some stuff in between. 

It's every major console, not EVERY console. Kinda hard to fit that into a title.

I'll be looking at the visual elements moreso than practicality, because in that case the modern consoles would win everything.

Instead, think of this more of the "aesthetic".

PSTV is gonna look like the Vita, the N-Gage isn't on here, and no alternative or secret menus. Didn't wanna make this vid an hour long.

I probably missed a few, but ya know.
