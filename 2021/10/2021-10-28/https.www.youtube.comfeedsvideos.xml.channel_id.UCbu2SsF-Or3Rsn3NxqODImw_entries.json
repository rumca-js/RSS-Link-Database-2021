Here are the event dates and times to play.\n\nCall of Duty: Vanguard is making it's way to consoles and PC on November 5th. In the meantime, Activision shared a massive blog post surrounding the events at launch, pre-season, as well as news on the all-new pacific map. In this video, Richie Bracamonte breaks down the blog post to give you all the dates, event info and more.\n\nWarzone's new Vanguard pacific map arrives on December 2nd. Players who already own Vanguard will have 24 hours of early access. As we part ways with Verdansk for the last time, Call of Duty announced a few events leading to the map's sendoff. They also hinted that we'll probably leave Verdansk amid another doomsday scenario saying, \"Bombs away \u2013 see what happens to Verdansk before Warzone goes dark to prepare for Caldera and Season One.\"\n\nSeveral other updates were revealed surrounding season one of Vanguard. This includes the full list of multiplayer maps, modes and more. 12 operators are confirmed, all with customizable skins that can be acquired via in-game challenges or by unlocking them in the season 1 battle pass. Long time fans of the franchise will also see the return of \"Shipment\"- a map that dates back all the way to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. \n\nStay tuned to GameSpot for our upcoming review of Call of Duty: Vanguard, as well as continued coverage with gameplay, livestreams and more.   \n\n#COD #CoDVanguard", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8SlW_sTKCE", "date_published": "2021-10-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "How To Play New Warzone Map Early | GameSpot News", "description": "In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about how you can play the Warzone Pacific map early, a mobile game being accused of copying Modern Warfare 2019, and physical GTA on Switch requiring a download.\n\nIn this video, Persia talks about the Call of Duty: Vanguard's integration with Warzone on December 2, 2021.Warzone Pacific will also bring the arrival of the recently revealed RICOCHET Anti-Cheat System to hopefully help cut back on Warzone's ongoing cheating problem on the same day it launches.\u00a0\n\nPersia also talks about a mobile game called Combat Master being accused of copying Modern Warfare 2019's gameplay and UI. As of October 28, Combat Master Online FPS is still available to download and play, but it is uncertain how long Activision will let this apparent clone slide by without any legal action.\u00a0\n\nLater in the video, the physical version of the GTA Trilogy on Switch will reportedly still require a download. On the eShop, The Definitive Edition appears as a bundle containing the three GTA games as separate products, each with a \"not available to purchase\" alone notice.

Call Of Duty: Vanguard\u2019s install sizes are reportedly 30%-50% smaller at launch than previous games in the series on PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a small install--it'll still require 56 to 93 gigs free, depending on the system. It might finally be time for you to uninstall Modern Warfare or Cold War to make space. Don\u2019t forget to plan for more Warzone installs when the new Pacific map launches.\u00a0\n\nBlizzard's is still seeing the fallout of toxic workplace allegations against it, with the latest developments being the cancellation of BlizzCon this year, and Overwatch character McCree's name changing to Cole Cassidy. McCree previously carried the name of an employee who was ousted from the company amid sexual harassment and discrimination allegations at Activision Blizzard. To go along with Cole's new name, players can now change their BattleTags for Battle.net for free for a limited time.\u00a0\nFinally, Division 2 post-launch content has been delayed to February 2022 and Nintendo and Niantic have announced their next mobile app, Pikmin Bloom, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of Nintendo's nature-based franchise.\n\nTo find out what you need to know tomorrow, head on over to GameSpot.com and YouTube.com/Gamespot for more news.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBGkQYNJmKc", "date_published": "2021-10-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mario Party Superstars - N64 vs. Switch Graphics Comparison", "description": "With Mario Party Superstars bringing back boards and minigames from the N64 titles, we put Mario Party 2 head-to-head with Superstars to see the graphical differences.\n\nMario Party Superstars is the newest entry in the Mario Party series, and with it, five classic boards from the Nintendo 64 titles return. Those five boards are Peach\u2019s Birthday Cake and Yoshi\u2019s Tropical Island from the original Mario Party, Space Land and Horror Land from Mario Party 2 (which are showcased in this video), and Woody Woods from Mario Party 3. Superstars also contains 100 minigames from across the entire series, including the GameCube, Wii, and Wii U entries.\u00a0\n\nA few things to note about this video: The original version of Mario Party 2 is an N64 game, but the capture used in this video is the N64 version running on Wii U Virtual Console, while Mario Party Superstars was captured on a Nintendo Switch. Also, Mario Party 2 is running at 30fps, while Mario Party Superstars runs at 60fps, so you\u2019ll notice one is smoother than the other.\n\nMario Party Superstars releases for Nintendo Switch on October 29, 2021. As of right now, the N64 Mario Party games are not scheduled to be released as a part of Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online, but hopefully some of them will be in the future.
