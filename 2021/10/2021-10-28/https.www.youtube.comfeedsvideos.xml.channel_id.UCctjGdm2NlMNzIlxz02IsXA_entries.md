Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy: The Definitive Edition (catchy name) is in the spotlight due to some alterations made to Vice City that some find perplexing. Resident Evil 4 VR is also in a similar situation. Are these just capitulations to the "woke mob" (whatever that means) or is there something far less interesting at play? Should important pieces of art be edited to evolve with the times? It's been a while since I've done a Glasses Off and I have some thoughts. 

MESSAGE TO AUDIENCE ►
Thanks to all of you who are somehow still here. I really do appreciate the support. The fact that so many of you are still here despite my erratic schedule is something I don't take for granted. Been going through a lot of personal stuff during this pandemic. Won't get into specifics cuz a lot of it is personal and I don't like when people overshare, but I'm trying to just get a lot done and make stuff that's worth watching. Sincerely, thank you.
