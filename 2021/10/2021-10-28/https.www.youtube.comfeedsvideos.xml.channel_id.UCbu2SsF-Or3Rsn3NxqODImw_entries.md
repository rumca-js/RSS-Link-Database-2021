Call of Duty: Warzone's new Pacific map has a release date and a few surprises like a dogfighting mode! Here are the event dates and times to play.

Call of Duty: Vanguard is making it's way to consoles and PC on November 5th. In the meantime, Activision shared a massive blog post surrounding the events at launch, pre-season, as well as news on the all-new pacific map. In this video, Richie Bracamonte breaks down the blog post to give you all the dates, event info and more.

Warzone's new Vanguard pacific map arrives on December 2nd. Players who already own Vanguard will have 24 hours of early access. As we part ways with Verdansk for the last time, Call of Duty announced a few events leading to the map's sendoff. They also hinted that we'll probably leave Verdansk amid another doomsday scenario saying, "Bombs away – see what happens to Verdansk before Warzone goes dark to prepare for Caldera and Season One."

Several other updates were revealed surrounding season one of Vanguard. This includes the full list of multiplayer maps, modes and more. 12 operators are confirmed, all with customizable skins that can be acquired via in-game challenges or by unlocking them in the season 1 battle pass. Long time fans of the franchise will also see the return of "Shipment"- a map that dates back all the way to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. 

Stay tuned to GameSpot for our upcoming review of Call of Duty: Vanguard, as well as continued coverage with gameplay, livestreams and more.

In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about how you can play the Warzone Pacific map early, a mobile game being accused of copying Modern Warfare 2019, and physical GTA on Switch requiring a download.

In this video, Persia talks about the Call of Duty: Vanguard's integration with Warzone on December 2, 2021.Warzone Pacific will also bring the arrival of the recently revealed RICOCHET Anti-Cheat System to hopefully help cut back on Warzone's ongoing cheating problem on the same day it launches. 

Persia also talks about a mobile game called Combat Master being accused of copying Modern Warfare 2019's gameplay and UI. As of October 28, Combat Master Online FPS is still available to download and play, but it is uncertain how long Activision will let this apparent clone slide by without any legal action. 

Later in the video, the physical version of the GTA Trilogy on Switch will reportedly still require a download. On the eShop, The Definitive Edition appears as a bundle containing the three GTA games as separate products, each with a "not available to purchase" alone notice. However, it seems that Grand Theft Auto: Vice City will need a separate download, both when bought physically and digitally.

In this video, Persia goes over all of the big changes heading to the newest season of Apex Legends. Apex Legends: Escape introduces the new battle royale map called Storm Point, Ash who is the newest legend, and the C.A.R. SMG which is also a new weapon. A variety of other changes are also coming to other weapons, legends, and the ranked playlist.

Storm Point is the fourth and largest battle royale map to be added to Apex Legends and the first to be developed after the release of the game. There will be 15% more playable space on Storm Point, natural wildlife that can attack you, and gravity cannons to boost you around the map. 

Ash will provide exclusive intel to her and her squad with her passive that can scan deathboxes to find its attackers and slow enemies down with her tactical Arc Tether. Ash's ultimate is called dPhase Breach and it creates a one-way portal that can help your team get in or out of fights quickly.

The C.A.R. SMG is a hybrid weapon that can use both light and heavy ammo and attachments. This helps with inventory management and gives you a wider variety of loot options.

There are also changes to Wattson and overall weapon balancing for season 11's arsenal. Ranked playlists will also see changes to their point system to make games more rewarding for those who obtain kills and get kills on opponents of a higher rank.

In this episode of GameSpot News, Call Of Duty: Vanguard file size might spare you from deleting other games, change your Battle.net handle for free, BlizzCon is cancelled, and there’s another Pikmin game.

Here’s what you need to know in video games today. Call Of Duty: Vanguard’s install sizes are reportedly 30%-50% smaller at launch than previous games in the series on PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. That’s not to say it’s a small install--it'll still require 56 to 93 gigs free, depending on the system. It might finally be time for you to uninstall Modern Warfare or Cold War to make space. Don’t forget to plan for more Warzone installs when the new Pacific map launches. 

Blizzard's is still seeing the fallout of toxic workplace allegations against it, with the latest developments being the cancellation of BlizzCon this year, and Overwatch character McCree's name changing to Cole Cassidy. McCree previously carried the name of an employee who was ousted from the company amid sexual harassment and discrimination allegations at Activision Blizzard. To go along with Cole's new name, players can now change their BattleTags for Battle.net for free for a limited time. 
Finally, Division 2 post-launch content has been delayed to February 2022 and Nintendo and Niantic have announced their next mobile app, Pikmin Bloom, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of Nintendo's nature-based franchise.

## Mario Party Superstars - N64 vs. Switch Graphics Comparison

With Mario Party Superstars bringing back boards and minigames from the N64 titles, we put Mario Party 2 head-to-head with Superstars to see the graphical differences.

Mario Party Superstars is the newest entry in the Mario Party series, and with it, five classic boards from the Nintendo 64 titles return. Those five boards are Peach’s Birthday Cake and Yoshi’s Tropical Island from the original Mario Party, Space Land and Horror Land from Mario Party 2 (which are showcased in this video), and Woody Woods from Mario Party 3. Superstars also contains 100 minigames from across the entire series, including the GameCube, Wii, and Wii U entries. 

A few things to note about this video: The original version of Mario Party 2 is an N64 game, but the capture used in this video is the N64 version running on Wii U Virtual Console, while Mario Party Superstars was captured on a Nintendo Switch. Also, Mario Party 2 is running at 30fps, while Mario Party Superstars runs at 60fps, so you’ll notice one is smoother than the other.

Mario Party Superstars releases for Nintendo Switch on October 29, 2021. As of right now, the N64 Mario Party games are not scheduled to be released as a part of Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online, but hopefully some of them will be in the future.
