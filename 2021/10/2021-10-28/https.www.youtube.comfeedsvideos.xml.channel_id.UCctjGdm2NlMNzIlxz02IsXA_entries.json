Resident Evil 4 VR is also in a similar situation. Are these just capitulations to the \"woke mob\" (whatever that means) or is there something far less interesting at play? Should important pieces of art be edited to evolve with the times? It's been a while since I've done a Glasses Off and I have some thoughts. \n\nMESSAGE TO AUDIENCE \u25ba\nThanks to all of you who are somehow still here. I really do appreciate the support. The fact that so many of you are still here despite my erratic schedule is something I don't take for granted. Been going through a lot of personal stuff during this pandemic. Won't get into specifics cuz a lot of it is personal and I don't like when people overshare, but I'm trying to just get a lot done and make stuff that's worth watching. Sincerely, thank you. \n\nSocial Media!\nTWITTER \u25ba https://twitter.com/ChrisRGun\nINSTAGRAM \u25ba https://www.instagram.com/chris_ray_gun/\nTWITCH \u25ba https://www.twitch.tv/chrisraygun\nTIKTOK \u25ba https://www.tiktok.com/@chrisraygun\nSUBREDDIT \u25ba https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisRayGun/\n\nSupport Me Over Here!\nMERCH \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/chris-ray-gun\nPATREON \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/ChrisRay\n\nPodcasts!\nSACRED SYMBOLS : A PLAYSTATION PODCAST \u25ba https://apple.co/2Rqmklc\nSNARK TANK \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/TheSnarkTank", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PE1gvLY7RM", "date_published": "2021-10-28 16:57:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
