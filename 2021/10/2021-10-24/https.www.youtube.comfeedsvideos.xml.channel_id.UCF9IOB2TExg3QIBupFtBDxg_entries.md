Imminent drops in infections

Cases could fall to around 5,000 a day before Christmas

Prof John Edmunds, Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, LSHTM

Member of SAGE

Our model was projecting that cases would start to decline some time in the autumn. 

However, the model also suggests that cases may start to climb again in the spring, 

due to a combination of waning immunity and increased contacts

Cases currently being driven by high case rates in children

Virus is close to reaching “endemic equilibrium” 

Recent oscillations in case rates will soon level

Rishi Sunak

at the moment the data does not suggest that we should be immediately moving to 'Plan B

Maggie Throup, UK vaccines minister

'Plan A' is working, situation where we need to be

United States

Pfizer for children, 5 to 11, FDA votes for EMU tomorrow

From first half of November

2 shots, 3 weeks gap

One third of adult dose

25,000 centres signed up for roll out

28 million children in demographic

Results are the first from a pivotal trial of any COVID-19 vaccine in children under 12 years of age

In participants 5 to 11 years of age, the vaccine was safe, well tolerated and showed robust neutralizing antibody responses

Phase 2/3 study

United States, Finland, Poland, Spain

Children 6 months to 11 years of age

N = 2,268 5 to 11 years of age

Received a 10 µg dose level in a two-dose regimen

Strong SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing antibody response,

one month after the second dose

Continue to accumulate the safety and efficacy data

Topline readouts for the other two age cohorts from the trial, soon

Children 2-5 years of age

Children 6 months to 2 years of age

About the Phase 1/2/3 Trial in Children

N = 4,500 children ages 6 months to 11 years

More than 90 clinical trial sites

Children under 5 received a 3 µg dose

Trial enrolled children with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection

Reduction in self-reported long COVID after vaccination

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19vaccinationandselfreportedlongcovidintheuk/25october2021

Identified themselves as experiencing persistent symptoms 12 weeks after first infection

A first vaccine dose was associated with an initial 13% decrease in self-reported long COVID,

and a further 9% sustained decrease after receiving the second vaccination

No evidence of differences in self-reported between Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, compared to Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines

Don’t aspirate extrapolation

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/administration.html

Aspiration before injection of vaccines or toxoids (i.e., pulling back on the syringe plunger after needle insertion but before injection)

is not necessary because no large blood vessels are present at the recommended injection sites, 

and a process that includes aspiration might be more painful for infants

Protection down to 3% in August

Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections in 620,000 U.S. Veterans, February 1, 2021 to August 13, 2021 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.13.21264966v1

National data on COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections is inadequate

Comparing SARS CoV-2 infection by vaccination status

February 1, 2021 to August 13, 2021

Veterans Health Administration

Covering 2.7% of the U.S. population

Vaccine protection declined by mid-August 2021

Decreasing from 91.9% in March

Down to 53.9%

(p less than 0.01, n=619,755)

Declines were greatest for the Janssen vaccine followed by Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna. 

Specifically, for protection against infection

Janssen
March, 92%
August, 3%

Moderna
March, 91%
August, 64%

Pfizer
March, 95%
August, 50%

Delta variant as the primary determinant of infection

It is not yet clear whether reductions in vaccine protection against infection will translate into similar reductions in protection against hospitalization and death. 

Vaccines remain the most important tool to prevent infection, severe illness, and death,
 
but vaccines should be accompanied by additional measures, including masking, hand washing, physical distancing, and other public health interventions

The COVID-19 vaccine is backed by science and is no way influenced by horoscopes

But come on Scorpios!
