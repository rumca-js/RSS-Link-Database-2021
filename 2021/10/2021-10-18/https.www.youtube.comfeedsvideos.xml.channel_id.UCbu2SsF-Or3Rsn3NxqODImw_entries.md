In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Splinter Cell reportedly getting a new game soon, the Xbox Series X mini-fridge selling out fast, and Microsoft’s plans to buy more studios in the future. 

In this video, DeVante talks about a report from VGC that Ubisoft is working on a new Splinter Cell game. The report shed no light on what type of game the new Splinter Cell might be, though it was described as being a "mainline" entry as opposed to some type of spin-off.

DeVante also talks about the Xbox Series X mini-fridge selling out fast as well as Phil Spencer revealing Microsoft is not done buying studios. Microsoft's last big gaming acquisition was ZeniMax/Bethesda, which it paid $7.5 billion to buy. Microsoft now has 23 game development studios spread across the world, working on a variety of projects.

Later in the video, he covers the latest games being added to Game Pass for the second half of October. Titles like: The Forgotten City, Outriders for PC, Backbone and Age of Empires IV.

Rocksteady of Batman Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight fame is finally back! This time, they're continuing the series with Suicide Squad. In Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, you'll play Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark as Amanda Waller pits you against the likes of the Flash, Green Lantern, and a big bad Superman, all likely being mind-controlled by Brainiac. While you'll potentially have Wonder Woman on your side, with a missing Batman, as ever, the odds are definitely not stacked in the Suicide Squad's favor. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League releases to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Playstation 5 in 2022.

Gotham Knights will let you play as Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing, and Red Hood and is set in the wake of Batman's death. The Bat-family faces its biggest challenge yet, as they face off against the Court of Owls. Here are all the details about WB Montreal's upcoming open-world action title. 

Check out Tamoor's feature about the Court of Owls: https://youtu.be/IR7Hrlh_dB0 

For as long as Gotham has existed, so has the Court of Owls, a mysterious and powerful organization that rules the city from the shadows. They have been hinted at in previous Batman games, but in Gotham Knights they'll be the main foes that Batgirl, Robin, Red Hood, and Nightwing will be up against in the wake of Batman's death.

In this video, we'll go through everything we know so far about Gotham Knights, the new game from WB Games Montreal, the studio best known for developing Batman: Arkham Origins. While Gotham Knights shares a lot of familiar characters and DNA with Rocksteady's beloved Arkham games, building on the universe with shake-ups to combat, it is a completely new and original story. 

The video also delves into who the Court of Owls are, but for a bigger deep dive, make sure to check out this video from GameSpot's Batman expert, Tamoor Hussain. Gotham Knights is due to launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2022.
