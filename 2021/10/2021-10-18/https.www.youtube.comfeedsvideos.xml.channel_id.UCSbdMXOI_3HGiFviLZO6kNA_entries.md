Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news. So much is happening in October, Facebook connect is right around the corner, Varjo's event is in 2 days, HTC just announced the Flow, Pimax has a pending announcement, things are about to go ballistic and I have a feeling VR will never be the same after.
