I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Street scenes Warsaw and Krakow, buses, people on sidewalks, Trolley with sign reading ‚ÄúDWORSKA‚Äù. Inside a trolley full of passengers. View out the trolley windshield at street, people waiting to board and a policeman standing on a median. Sidewalk scenes, two men walking by with boots over their shoulders, women looking at a cart displaying wares. Boy runs by with newspapers under his arm,
