We’re taking AsapSCIENCE out of the classroom and into the country where we’ll be living completely off the grid in order to research sustainability and ways to combat the climate crisis. Each episode sees us shutting off a basic necessity and then relying on science to figure out how to do it ourselves. It’s part of asapSCIENCE’s brand new series with YouTube Originals designed to help us all meet our sustainability goals and to combat Climate Change.
