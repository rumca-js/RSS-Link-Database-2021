High infection rates in UK, going down in US

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/10/19/people-must-cautious-day-to-day-interactions-covid-cases-climb/

Lower functional immunity in our population than most other 
Western European countries

Early vaccine roll out

AstraZeneca protects slightly less well than Pfizer against infection and transmission, particularly delta variant

Slightly lower overall vaccination coverage, particularly vaccinating teenagers

Fewer social restrictions

High rates of testing

UK, ONS

 https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights

Two vaccine doses give similar protection as previous infection 

Two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca

Provided a similar level of protection as having had a previous natural infection of coronavirus

During delta variant times

Vaccination reduced the risk of testing positive, 

both when the alpha variant was dominant in the UK (1 December 2020 to 16 May 2021) 

and when the delta variant was dominant (17 May to 14 August 2021)

Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech

Reduced the risk of testing positive by 73% in the delta period

Two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca

Reduced the risk of testing positive by 62% in the delta period

Two vaccination doses, more effective than one at preventing symptomatic infection in both periods. 

Three weeks after vaccination

Two doses always more protective than one

(75% v 58%)

Inconsistent with covid symptom study

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/do-i-need-a-covid-vaccine-if-ive-had-covid

Two doses of the Pfizer

87% protection against infection

Two doses of the AstraZeneca

71% protection against infection

Natural infection alone

Only gave 65% protection against catching it again

Israeli data consistent with ONS but inconsistent with covid symptom study

Protection of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to that of BNT162b2 vaccine protection: A three-month nationwide experience from Israel
 https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255670v1.full.pdf

Vaccination was highly effective 

Estimated efficacy for documented infection of 92·8% 
Hospitalization 94·2% 
Severe illness 94·4% 
Death 93·7% 

Protection from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection

Estimated efficacy for documented infection of 94·8% 
Hospitalization 94·1% 
Severe illness 96·4%

All deaths registered in the week to 8 October 

COVID-19 deaths fall in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland
Up in Wales

Total UK deaths in the week, 12,490

14.7% above the average in 2015 to 2019

820 involved the coronavirus (COVID-19)

154 fewer than the previous week

Deaths involving COVID-19, 1 in 15 deaths (6.6%).

UK total deaths include non-residents.

1 million people in UK countries had COVID-19 in the latest week

1.63% in England (1 in 60 people)
One in 70 people the week before

2.18% in Wales (1 in 45 people)
One in 55 people the week before 

0.82% in Northern Ireland (1 in 120 people)
One in 130 people the week before
 
1.26% in Scotland (1 in 80 people)
One in 60 people the week before

Hello John, Just to let you know that one of my posts referring to your video on aspiration has been pulled from LinkedIn.   This is the first time that one of my posts has been pulled and I have put out some pretty controversial posts on other subjects.

Adults: Dosing Regimens

The dose most commonly used in clinical trials is IVM 0.2–0.6 mg/kg PO given as a single dose or as a once-daily dose for up to 5 days.

Adverse events

Generally well tolerated

Dizziness

Pruritis

GI effects (e.g., nausea, diarrhea)

Neurological AEs have been reported when IVM has been used to treat parasitic diseases, 

but it is not clear whether these AEs were caused by IVM or the underlying conditions.

Comments and links to clinical trials

Generally given on an empty stomach with water; however, administering IVM with food increases its bioavailability.

A list of clinical trials is available here: Ivermectin

Alexei Kouprianov, independent analyst and biologist

The data for [Russia] is absolutely unreliable

Recently ex St. Petersburg campus of the Higher School of Economics (September 2020)

Handling of the pandemic, largely left to the regions

Regional officials conceal problems, fear of losing their posts

Therefore critics, even analytical experts, are sidelined

Iceland restricts Moderna

https://www.icelandreview.com/news/moderna-use-on-pause-in-iceland/

Chief Epidemiologist, Þórólfur Guðnason

Moderna, only be used for booster shots in 60+

Unpublished data from the Nordic countries indicate that the risk of cardiac inflammation after vaccination against COVID-19 is much higher among 18 to 39-year-olds if the Moderna vaccine is used than after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine

Cardiac inflammation after vaccination is much less common among older demographics

In 12 to 17-year-olds, lack of European data

Under 60 who have received a single shot of Modern, to complete their vaccination with Pfizer

Men 18-39 are not recommended to accept the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine
Iceland data, vast majority of vaccination side effects emerge shortly after vaccination
