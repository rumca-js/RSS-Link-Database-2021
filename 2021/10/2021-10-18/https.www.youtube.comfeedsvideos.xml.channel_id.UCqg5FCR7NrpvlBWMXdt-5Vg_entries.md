Halloween’s Myers has endured for over four decades, becoming a horror icon in his own right. Versions of the character have appeared in 11 films across various iterations of the franchise, played by 13 different actors. With his white mask, boiler suit, and kitchen knife, Michael Myers is genuinely iconic. Why is Myers so effective? What makes this particular monster so compelling? And given the character’s seeming simplicity, why have so many films struggled to capture what makes Myers so haunting?
