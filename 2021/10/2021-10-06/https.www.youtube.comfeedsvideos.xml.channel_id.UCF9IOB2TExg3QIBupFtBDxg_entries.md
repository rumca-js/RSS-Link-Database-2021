UK, high prevalence maintained

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-not-showing-signs-of-dropping

End of September

Based on 39,742 recent swab tests, between 11th and 25th 
September 2021

58,126 new daily symptomatic cases

Based on PCR and LFT test data

In the fully vaccinated population, 14,352 new daily symptomatic cases

Overall UK Prevalence

On average 1 in 93 people in the UK have symptomatic COVID

Increase mostly in under 19s

Uptick in the number of active cases in people aged 20-50

Cases remain low and stable in contributors over the age of 50

UK R around 1.1

England, 1.1

Wales, 1.1 (currently increasing)

Scotland, 1.0

ZOE’s predicted Long COVID incidence rate

804 people a day will go on to experience symptoms for longer than 12 weeks

Professor Tim Spector

We’re seeing infections being passed up the generational ladder, likely from school children to their parents. 

Most of these new adult infections are in the under 50s, who still have a relatively low risk of being admitted to hospital, especially if they’ve been fully vaccinated.

As the winter approaches, it’s important parents of school-aged children and students don’t pass the virus on to more vulnerable grandparents by not recognising simple cold-like symptoms as a possible COVID infection. 

This is a critical time and a little caution could make all the difference in avoiding a winter crisis for hospitals.
