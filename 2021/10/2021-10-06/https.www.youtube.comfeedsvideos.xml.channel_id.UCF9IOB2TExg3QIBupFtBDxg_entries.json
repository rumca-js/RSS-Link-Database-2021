infections are in the under 50s, who still have a relatively low risk of being admitted to hospital, especially if they\u2019ve been fully vaccinated.\n\nAs the winter approaches, it\u2019s important parents of school-aged children and students don\u2019t pass the virus on to more vulnerable grandparents by not recognising simple cold-like symptoms as a possible COVID infection. \n\nThis is a
