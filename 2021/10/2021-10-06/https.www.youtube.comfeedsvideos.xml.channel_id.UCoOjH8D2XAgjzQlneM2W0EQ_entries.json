The only problem is - this video is fake. It was a fraud designed to swindle investors into dumping more money into this \u201ctesla killer\u201d - allegedly.\n\nThese regular car companies were under huge pressure from analysts and shareholders to electrify so their stock could see similar gains. GM entered into a strategic manufacturing partnership with Nikola Motors. But as GM would soon find out - Nikola Motors was far from the saving grace they hoped for. \n\n\u201cI never deceived anyone!\u201d - Nikola Executive Chairman, Trevor Milton. Trevor Milton, the man behind Nikola Motors, has had a sketchy track record to say the least. Tech founders are often criticized for being too ambitious or too optimistic, but according to Hindenburg Research, Trevor took this way too literally.\n\nAfter Trevor sold his very first business, a security and alarm business, Trevor started a used car sales website that ultimately failed, but it got him into the world of EVs. After dHybrid\u2019s launch, Trevor became the CEO of Swift Transportation. But Trevor abandoned ship and decided to start a new, but not very different, company with his dad, called dHybrid Systems LLC. Two years after starting dHybrid Systems, he sold it to Worthington Industries for $15.9m, giving them almost 80% of the company. \n\nNikola Motors started a lot like how all of his other business ideas ended, with a lot of stretching of the truth. They started to duct tape together third-party truck parts in an effort to build their first truck.\n\n-----------------------\n\nNo Spirit - Morning In The Cafe https://chll.to/0a89612d \n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
