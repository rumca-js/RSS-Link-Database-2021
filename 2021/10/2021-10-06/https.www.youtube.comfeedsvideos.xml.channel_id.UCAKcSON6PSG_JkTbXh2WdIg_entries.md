Mary Lucia talks about "Inventing David Geffen," a documentary that first appeared on PBS's "American Masters" and is now streaming on Netflix. 

"He's a bajillionaire record mogul, label owner, movie producer, etc.," Mary says, "but what's more interesting to me about it is how self made he truly was; the most ambitious person in the world."

Watch more of what Mary Lucia has to say about "Inventing David Geffen" in the video above.
