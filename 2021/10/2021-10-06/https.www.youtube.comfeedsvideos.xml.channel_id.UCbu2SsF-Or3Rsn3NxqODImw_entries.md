n this episode of GameSpot News, we explain why Battlefield’s open beta is months old, why EA might rename the FIFA series and when you can expect to see Halo Infinite ranked gameplay.

In this video, DeVante talks about why the Battlefield 2042 open beta is already facing a variety of bugs and issues just a day after going live. DICE also published a list of known issues with the Battlefield 2042 open beta, some of which have already been fixed for the full game's release in November.

DeVante also explains the reason EA is thinking about renaming their FIFA series of soccer games. This situation is similar, in some ways, to what's happening with EA's college football series which will return without the NCAA title. 

Later on, Halo Infinite’s ranked gameplay is revealed to be coming very soon and NPD credits a rise in game sales on older generations and lapsed gamers.

While you are pre-loading Battlefield 2042 ahead of the beta release we're here to tell you about what you're going to play. Here's what you need to know about the Orbital map, four specialists, gun attachment system, call-in tablet, and freaking tornadoes.

EA has launched the Battlefield 2042 beta, allowing players to dive into the hugely anticipated all-out warfare Conquest mode. We had an early look at the game during a hands-on preview event with three hours of game time prior to the beta's launch, and we have so much to break down with you all.

In this video, we talk about our impressions on the core gameplay loop, if Battlefield feels as good as its predecessors, and some of the new quality-of-life changes. From the new vehicle call-in system to the new attachment changes letting you adjust your weapon on the fly, Battlefield 2042 has made a lot of visible tweaks that are sure to change your gameplay up in new and fun ways. 

There were also four specialists--the game's equivalent of classes--that we got to use, with McKay getting most of the love thanks to his handy grapple hook and intrinsic mobility perks. We’d also be remiss to not mention the wicked new tornado wrecking havoc on players and the map and how that looked for the first time, as well as breaking down the Orbital map’s rocket launch levolution. For more Battlefield 2042, be sure to stick to GameSpot!

Far Cry 6 can be a pretty tough game at first if you don’t have an understanding of weapon builds, gear, and crafting systems. In this video, we’ll get you caught up on the essential places to focus and things you should know to enjoy the mayhem. 

Far Cry 6 draws its systems and inspiration from a lot of past Far Cry games, including many RPG mechanics from New Dawn. The game sports a fairly punishing leveling system unless you know what you’re doing. There’s a lot to learn at first, including gun customization and modding, how to find unique weapons, base building, Amigos, superweapons, and the various crafting systems you need to learn to level your gear. 

In this video, we’re going to focus you on the essential things to know. That includes how to build or find powerful guns, the pros and cons of semi-powerful Supremos and Resolver Weapons, the usefulness of stealth, how to level your initial Alligator pet, what to focus on with base-building, how gear lets you punch above your level, and why side missions matter. We’re also going to tackle how to sort out where to find upgrading resources and how to fight some very aggressive and tanky choppers. 

Far Cry 6 releases on October 7 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC. For more news, season pass updates, including DLC around Blood Dragon as well as classic villains like Vaas, and videos about Far Cry, including a full review, head on over to GameSpot.com.

The Nintendo Switch OLED is a more impressive update than you'd expect thanks to the gorgeous screen.
Description: The Nintendo Switch OLED is a marked improvement over the original and Switch Lite. If you play a lot in handheld mode, the OLED model is a surprisingly huge upgrade. And if you don't play your Switch in handheld mode often, the Switch OLED's new screen is impressive enough that it could change that. 

The Nintendo Switch OLED will be available on October 8, 2021. You can read the full written Nintendo Switch OLED review by Steven Petite on GameSpot.
