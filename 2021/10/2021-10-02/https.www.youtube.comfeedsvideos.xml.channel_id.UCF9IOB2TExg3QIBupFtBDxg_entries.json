predictive of T cell memory\n\nCDC \n\nStill recommends a full vaccination dose for all\n\nthe immune response from vaccination is more predictable\n\nantibody responses after infection vary widely by individual\n\nJune, Peter Marks, Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nWe do know that the immunity after vaccination is better than the immunity after natural infection\n\ngenerally the immunity after natural infection tends to wane after about 90 days\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j8ziaOpl7o&t=1724s\n\nIt appears from the literature that natural infection provides immunity, \n\nbut that immunity is seemingly not as strong and may not be as long lasting as that provided by the vaccine\n\nUK covid pass
