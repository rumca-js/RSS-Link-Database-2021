Today, we cover the eagles throughout the first, second, and third ages. From Beleriand, to Numenor, to Middle-earth, the great eagles rescued allies, fought dragons, waged war, and remained loyal servants of Manwe, the Lord of the Valar.\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
