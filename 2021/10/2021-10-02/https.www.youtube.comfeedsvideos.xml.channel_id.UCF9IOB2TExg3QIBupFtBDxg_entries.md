Is this antiviral a game changer, Oral Antiviral, molnupiravir

Merck and Ridgeback

Oral Antiviral, molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801)

Positive Interim Analysis of Phase 3 Study

Significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization or death

During day 1 to 5 to 29 days

Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial 

At risk, non-hospitalized adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 

A global Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study 

of non-hospitalized adult patients

Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States

Eligibility criteria

Laboratory-confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19

With symptom onset within 5 days of study randomization

All patients were required to have at least one risk factor

Molnupiravir group

Hospitalization or dead, 7.3% of patients
28 out of 385

No deaths

Placebo group

Hospitalization or dead, 14.1% of patients
53 out of 377

P is 0.0012

8 deaths

Data Monitoring Committee in consultation with Food and Drug Administration

Recruitment into the study stopped early 

Due to these positive results

Merck, application for Emergency Use 

Authorization in US

Other regulatory bodies worldwide

About the Results of the Planned Interim Analysis

Evaluated data n = 775

Recruitment 90% of 1,550 the intended sample 

Molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization and/or death across all key subgroups; 

Efficacy was not affected by timing of symptom onset or underlying risk factor

About 40% of participants had sequencing data

Molnupiravir demonstrated consistent efficacy across viral variants Gamma, Delta, and Mu

Incidence of adverse event between groups

Molnupiravir group

Incidence of any adverse event, 35%

Drug-related adverse events, 12%

Subjects discontinued study therapy due to an adverse event, 1.3%

Placebo groups

Incidence of any adverse event, 40%

Drug-related adverse events, 11%

Subjects discontinued study therapy due to an adverse event, 3.4%

Merck has said data shows molnupiravir is not capable of inducing genetic changes in human cells, 

but men enrolled in its trials had to abstain from intercourse or agree to use contraception. 

Women of child-bearing age in the study could (not) be pregnant and also had to use birth control.

About Merck’s Efforts to Enable Access to Molnupiravir, if it is Granted EUA or Approval

Merck has been producing molnupiravir at risk. 

Merck expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by the end of 2021

Existing procurement agreement with the U.S. Government

Merck will supply approximately 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir to the U.S. government upon EAU

$700 per 5 day course (2 doses per day)

$1.2 billion purchase agreement for the 

1.7 million 5-day treatment courses of molnupiravir

A global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study,

Post infection natural immunity, debate and implications for mandatory vaccination

https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2101

US as of 11th December 2020

https://web.archive.org/web/20210115184811/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html

US, Natural infection, Feb 2020 to May 2021

0 – 17    26.8 / 73    37%

18 – 49   60.5 / 138   44%

50 – 64    20.4 / 62    32%

65+     12.3 / 54    23%

Total    120.3/ 328   37%

Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection

https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf4063

N = 254 blood samples post infection

N = 51 long term follow up

Antibodies against SARSCoV-
2 spike and receptor binding domain
(RBD) declined moderately over 8 months

Memory B cells against SARS-CoV-2 spike 
increased between 1 month and 8 months
after infection. 

Proportion of subjects positive for CD4+ T cells (92%) remained high at 6 to 8 months after infection.

The different types of immunememory each had distinct kinetics, resulting in complex interrelationships over time

CONCLUSION

Substantial immune memory is generated after COVID-19

About 95% of subjects retained immune memory at ~6 months after infection

Circulating antibody titers were not predictive of T cell memory

CDC 

Still recommends a full vaccination dose for all

the immune response from vaccination is more predictable

antibody responses after infection vary widely by individual

June, Peter Marks, Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research

We do know that the immunity after vaccination is better than the immunity after natural infection

generally the immunity after natural infection tends to wane after about 90 days

It appears from the literature that natural infection provides immunity, 

but that immunity is seemingly not as strong and may not be as long lasting as that provided by the vaccine

proof of natural immunity shown by a positive PCR test result for COVID-19, lasting for 180 days after the date of the positive test

Protection of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to that of BNT162b2 vaccine protection: A three-month nationwide experience from Israel 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255670v1.full.pdf

Vaccination was highly effective

Estimated efficacy for documented infection of  92·8%

Hospitalization 94·2%

Severe illness  94·4%

Death   93·7% 

Protection from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection

Estimated efficacy for documented infection of  94·8%

Hospitalization 94·1%

Severe illness  96·4%

Ministry of Health during summer surge

Between 5 July and 3 August

(over half a million infected but unvaccinated)

Just 1% of weekly new cases were in people who had previously had covid-19

Dvir Aran, biomedical data, Technion–Israel Institute of Technology

these numbers look very low

the data suggest that the recovered have better protection than people who were vaccinated

Systemic side-effects were more common in people previously infected

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309921002243

Large UK study

1·6 times after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19

2·9 times after the first dose of BNT162b2

56% more likely to experience a severe side effect that required hospital care 

Conclusion

Public health strategy versus individualised medicine
