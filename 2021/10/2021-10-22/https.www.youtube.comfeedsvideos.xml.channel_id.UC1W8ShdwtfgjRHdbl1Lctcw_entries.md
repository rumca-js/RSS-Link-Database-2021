I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Exterior view of older apartment buildings at 330 South Spring Street, housing street-level retail stores and apartments above in Holly Hotel, in 1940s. Included are Vost Leather Co.and Pioneer Dairy Lunch.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
