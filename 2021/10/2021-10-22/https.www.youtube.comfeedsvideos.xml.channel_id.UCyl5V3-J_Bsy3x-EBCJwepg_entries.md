The Atlantic tries to make The Babylon Bee's Kyle Mann explain why the joke is funny on this episode of The Bee Weekly. Kyle and Ethan are joined by Eli Chance and The Bee's own Bettina to dramatically reenact an encounter in which a barely awake Kyle was put on the spot to explain the joke and to give a defense against the accusation that Jesus would not want Christians to mock wokeness for a living. There's weird news like how shocking it is how little wizards earn in New Zealand and The Bee Team surprises Dan. As always, there is glorious hate mail.

Eli Chance is a comedy writer and performer. Check out some of his work on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgmiNFzRqhWsGwZb3X9C1Lg
