Battlefield 2042's open beta has passed and the community has plenty of thoughts to share. DICE recently revealed a good chunk of improvements they made, but we take things a step further and look at what else could use improvements.

Battlefield 2042 recently dropped a new specialist trailer showing off five more specialists, which will excite those ready for the game's launch. However, not everyone is sold, as specialists have been just one of many points of discussion surrounding the recent open beta. We've taken a look at specialists, optimization, and what else we want to see improved upon by the game's launch. Hopefully, fans will be excited again if even more fixes for these issues come through!

This video breaks down improvements we want, such as a greater incentive to stick with your squad and use teamwork. Battlefield 2042 encouraged a lot of lone wolves in its beta, which is not what the series is known for. There are also persisting bugs and glitches that need ironing out, which only worsen if you're playing on older consoles. 

The hope is that Battlefield 2042 can package as many fixes as possible before launch. The fixes detailed so far are encouraging, but with the release window so close, it's not sure what state the game will be in when it releases. Fingers crossed for the best! Battlefield 2042 will come out on early access on November 12, with a worldwide launch on November 19 for PC, Xbox One, Series S|X, PS4, and PS5.

Learn the tips and tricks you need to work as a team in Guardians of the Galaxy's Combat System.

Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy puts you in the hover boots of Star-Lord and asks you to lead a team of the Galaxy’s deadliest heroes, Drax, Rocket, Gamora, and Groot. You might not get to control the rest of the guardian’s directly, but don’t be fooled, you have to work as a team in order to make the most of the game’s combat.

There’s a lot of different attack properties and status effects at play and I found it took me a while to really get the hang of it. I’m here to lay it all down for you, so that you’ll have more of a leg up than I did when you start the game.
