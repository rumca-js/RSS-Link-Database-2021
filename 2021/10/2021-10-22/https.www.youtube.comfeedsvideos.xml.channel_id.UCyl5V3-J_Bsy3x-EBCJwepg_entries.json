Kyle and Ethan are joined by Eli Chance and The Bee's own Bettina to dramatically reenact an encounter in which a barely awake Kyle was put on the spot to explain the joke and to give a defense against the accusation that Jesus would not want Christians to mock wokeness for a living. There's weird news like how shocking it is how little wizards earn in New Zealand and The Bee Team surprises Dan. As always, there is glorious hate mail.\n\nEli Chance is a comedy writer and performer.
