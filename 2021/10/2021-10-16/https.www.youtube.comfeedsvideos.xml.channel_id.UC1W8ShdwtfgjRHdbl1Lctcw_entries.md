I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of  Street scenes, city in Japan 1940s, Shot passes by shops and many pedestrians, who look at camera, crowded sidewalk with stalls of sidewalk sellers on each side and daytime, shot from sidewalk towards street, Passes by long string of wooden houses, stores and small shops

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
