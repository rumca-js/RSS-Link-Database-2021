Nine years ago, Minneapolis band Tapes 'n Tapes traveled to A Center for the Arts in Fergus Falls, Minn., to perform a Caravan Du Nord concert. Caravan Du Nord is a concert series presented by the Minnesota Music Coalition and The Current, and it continues this weekend, Oct. 16, 2021, in Worthington, Minn., with a show featuring Salsa del Soul, The High 48's, and Cyr and the Cosmonauts. 

Getting back to Tapes 'n Tapes: Prior to their 2012 Caravan Du Nord performance, Tapes 'n Tapes were already well-known to The Current's audience. In addition to their songs being played on the air, the band had also performed in The Current studio, at Rock the Garden 2011, and at The Current's seventh birthday party in January 2012. Here is a compilation of three Tapes 'n Tapes performances from that time a decade ago.

3:37 "Cowbell" (2011, Rock the Garden)
6:23 "Just Drums" (2012, Caravan Du Nord in Fergus Falls, Minn.)
