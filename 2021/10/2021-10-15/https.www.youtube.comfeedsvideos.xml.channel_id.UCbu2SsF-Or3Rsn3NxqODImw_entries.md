In today’s GameSpot News, Persia talks about the three new mobs you can vote for during Minecraft Live, Battlefield 2042’s new Hazard Zone game mode, and the official competitive settings for Halo Infinite.

Three new mobs have been announced for the Minecraft Live fan vote and include the Glare, Allay, and Copper Golem. The Glare assists with finding dark areas, the Allay collects items for you, and the Copper Golem loves to press copper buttons and can turn into a statue over time. You can vote on your favorite mob during Minecraft Live on Saturday, October 16th. 

EA and DICE have now formally announced Battlefield 2042's Hazard Zone mode where you play in a four-member squad and your objective is to locate and retrieve data drives that have fallen from satellites. You and your team will have a choice of a mid-game or late-game extraction point where the rewards are greater if you stick around but more dangerous as only two squads can leave victorious. Hazard Zone supports 24 players on PS4 and Xbox One and 32 players on PS5/Xbox Series X|S and PC.

The settings for Halo Infinite’s competitive playlists were showcased during a livestream from 343 developers and include BR start, no motion tracker, friendly fire enabled, and more. Weapons, equipment, and grenades on maps will always appear in the same location on each map and mode combination and will respawn at the same intervals.

Battlefield 2042 finally gave players a crack at it's open beta and the conversation has been mixed. There's a lot of good, a lot of bad, and some real ugly parts that we decided to break down to see how the Open Beta actually went, and if Battlefield maybe even needs another delay? 

Battlefield 2042 wrapped up its open beta to mixed results. There were a lot of positives to the all-out warfare Conquest mode, which players from all over the world got a chance to sink their teeth into, but unfortunately, there were also issues. From bugs and visual glitches to poor performance optimization across multiple platforms, the 2042 beta definitely had its share of problems.

In this video, we break down some of the most important factors of just where the beta shined, and where it suggests that the full game will seriously need another look. Key components like the excellent destruction are addressed, as well as a look at some of the newest gameplay additions such as the vehicle call-in system and “plus” attachment system.

Your mileage may vary with how you felt on each of these components so definitely let us know in the comments which parts of the beta you enjoyed or didn't quite feel were up to your expectations. Be sure to subscribe to GameSpot cause we're approaching the release date for Battlefield 2042 real soon!
