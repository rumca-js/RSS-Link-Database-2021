There's a lot of good, a lot of bad, and some real ugly parts that we decided to break down to see how the Open Beta actually went, and if Battlefield maybe even needs another delay? \n\nBattlefield 2042 wrapped up its open beta to mixed results. There were a lot of positives to the all-out warfare Conquest mode, which players from all over the world got a chance to sink their teeth into, but unfortunately, there were also issues. From bugs and visual glitches to poor performance optimization across multiple platforms, the 2042 beta definitely had its share of problems.\n\nIn this video, we break down some of the most important factors of just where the beta shined, and where it suggests that the full game will seriously need another look. Key components like the excellent destruction are addressed, as well as a look at some of the newest gameplay additions such as the vehicle call-in system and \u201cplus\u201d attachment system.\n\nYour mileage may vary with how you felt on each of these components so definitely let us know in the comments which parts of the beta you enjoyed or didn't quite feel were up to your expectations.
