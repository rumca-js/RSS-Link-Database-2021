Kyle, Ethan, and Brett Kunkle from MAVEN guess which headlines are real or fake and have to eat mystery pie if they guess wrong. Brett Kunkle also kunkles some culture and helps us discern what is good or harmful in pop culture today. There’s weird news headlines, glorious hate mail, and other shenanigans going on at The Babylon Bee.
