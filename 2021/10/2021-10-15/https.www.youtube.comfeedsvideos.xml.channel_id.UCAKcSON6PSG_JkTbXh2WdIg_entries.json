Caravan Du Nord is a concert series presented by the Minnesota Music Coalition and The Current, and it continues this weekend, Oct. 16, 2021, in Worthington, Minn., with a show featuring Salsa del Soul, The High 48's, and Cyr and the Cosmonauts. \n\nGetting back to Tapes 'n Tapes: Prior to their 2012 Caravan Du Nord performance, Tapes 'n Tapes were already well-known to The Current's audience. In addition to their songs being played on the air, the band had also performed in The Current studio, at Rock the Garden 2011, and at The Current's seventh birthday party in January 2012. Here is a compilation of three Tapes 'n Tapes performances from that time a decade ago.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Badaboom\" (2011, in studio at The Current)\n3:37 \"Cowbell\" (2011, Rock the Garden)\n6:23 \"Just Drums\" (2012, Caravan Du Nord in Fergus Falls, Minn.)\n\nPERSONNEL\nJosh Grier \u2013 vocals, guitar\nJeremy Hanson \u2013 drums\nMatt Kretzman \u2013 keys\nErik Appelwick \u2013 bass\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Laura Gill; Dan Huiting; Andre Durand; Chris Hadland; Eric Schleicher; Joe Michaud-Scorza; Andy Underwood-Bultman; Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2006 profile: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2006/07/21/tapesntapes\n2006 Minnesota Music Awards feature:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2006/10/02/mnmusicawards\n2008 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2008/04/03/tapes_n_tapes\n2008 feature: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2008/04/10/tapesntapes\n2011 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/01/12/tapes_n_tapes\n2011 Rock the Garden set:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/06/18/tapes-n-tapes\n2011 MPR booth at the Minnesota State Fair session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/09/02/tapes-n-tapes-msf\n2012 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/01/27/tapesntapes-live\n2012 interview with Josh Grier:\nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2012/09/tapes-n-tapes-frontman-josh-grier-on-the-bands-impending-hiatus-and-his-new-solo-project/\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#tapesntapes", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRyy2rvxvtU", "date_published": "2021-10-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "FPA - Princess Wiko (Live at Talking Volumes)", "description": "FPA performed their new song \"Princess Wiko\" at the Fitzgerald Theater for MPR's Talking Volumes.
