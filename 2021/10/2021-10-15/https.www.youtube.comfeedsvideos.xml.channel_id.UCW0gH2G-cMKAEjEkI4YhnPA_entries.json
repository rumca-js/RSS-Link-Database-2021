In this video, we will track their origins and travels from the Vales of Anduin, while covering the three branches of the hobbits: the Harfoots, Fallohides, and Stoors.  We will highlight their distinctives and how their unique characteristics lived on to their descendants like Bilbo, Merry, and Pippin!\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell!\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
