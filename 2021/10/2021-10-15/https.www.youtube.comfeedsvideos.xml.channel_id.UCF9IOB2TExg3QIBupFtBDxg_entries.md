Six months

Half dose

Six to eight months after vaccination, antibody levels dropped in vaccine recipients. 

A half-dose booster at least six months after initial vaccination restored antibodies levels

People from original trial, a clear uptick in breakthrough infections this July and August

Week ending 9 October 2021 

People that that had COVID-19 in the week 

Up in England, Wales and NI

Down in Scotland

1.63% in England (1 in 60 people)

2.18% in Wales (1 in 45 people)

0.82% in Northern Ireland (1 in 120 people)

1.26% in Scotland (1 in 80 people)

People testing positive for antibodies

93.6%

Mortality displacement did not offset excess deaths by mid-2021 

Some evidence of mortality displacement during the pandemic

Mortality displacement, when vulnerable people die sooner than expected

Potentially leading to a lower-than-average period of mortality 

These periods of below average mortality did not offset the high number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic

3 January 2020 to 2 July 2021

97,981 excess deaths in England and Wales

(compared to what we would expect in a non-pandemic period). 

Within 28 days of a positive test, 138,379

Certificated, 161,798

Long covid

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights#cis

Long covid as of 5 September 2021

An estimated 1.1 million in the UK experiencing long COVID

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights#cis

1.7% of the total population were experiencing self-reported long COVID

Up from 970,000 (1.5%) at 1 August 2021

831,000 (77%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least 12 weeks previously

405,000 (37%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least one year previously

Symptoms adversely affected the day-to-day activities of around two-thirds (65%) of those with self-reported long COVID

Fatigue (56%)

Shortness of breath (40%)

Loss of smell (32%)

Difficulty concentrating (31%)

Professor Tim Spector

The UK seems to be slowly waking up to the fact that COVID cases are too high, 

but the reality is they’ve been soaring for months and many countries have put us on their red list. 

Infections remain high in young people, and look to be spilling over into the 35-55 year olds. 

If these increases creep into the over 55s it could spell disaster for the NHS this winter. 

Herd immunity

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJHdFOwZjVI

Minimum 85%

With cases so high, it’s clear that herd immunity isn't happening

Current symptoms in vaccinated and children

Runny nose, 76%

Headache, 75%

Sneezing, 66%

Sore throat, 53%

Cough 53%

Loss of smell or taste
