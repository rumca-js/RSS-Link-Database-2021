George:
I didn't get any bread.
Jerry:
Just forget it. Let it go.
George:
Excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
Soup Nazi:
Bread, two dollars extra.
George:
Two dollars? But everybody in front of me got free bread.
Soup Nazi:
You want bread?
George:
Yes, please.
Soup Nazi:
THREE dollars!
George:
What?!

NO SOUP FOR YOU!
