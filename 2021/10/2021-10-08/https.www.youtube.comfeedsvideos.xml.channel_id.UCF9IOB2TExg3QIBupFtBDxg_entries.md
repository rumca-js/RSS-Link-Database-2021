Ivermectin: How false science created a Covid 'miracle' drug

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-58170809

BBC Reality Check

But the BBC can reveal there are serious errors in a number of key studies that the drug's promoters rely on.

but thousands of supporters, many of them anti-vaccine activists, have continued to vigorously campaign for its use.

Members of social media groups swap tips on getting hold of the drug, even advocating the versions used for animals

Large pro-ivermectin Facebook groups have turned into forums for people to find advice on where to buy it, including preparations meant for animals.

The BBC can reveal that more than a third of 26 major trials of the drug for use on Covid have serious errors or signs of potential fraud. 

The group of independent scientists examined virtually every randomised controlled trial (RCT) on ivermectin and Covid

That’s how they all met on Twitter

They've been working together remotely on an informal and voluntary basis during the pandemic. 

Reference please

The BBC can reveal that more than a third of 26 major trials of the drug for use on Covid have serious errors or signs of potential fraud. 

None of the rest show convincing evidence of ivermectin's effectiveness. 

Dr Kyle Sheldrick, one of the group investigating the studies, said they had not found "a single clinical trial" claiming to show that ivermectin prevented Covid deaths that did not contain "either obvious signs of fabrication or errors so critical they invalidate the study".

Out of a total of 26 studies examined, there was evidence in five that the data may have been faked

On top of these flawed trials, there were 14 authors of studies who failed to send data back. 

The independent scientists have flagged this as a possible indicator of fraud. 

The sample of research papers examined by the independent group also contains some high-quality studies from around the world. 

A recent study in Lebanon was found to have blocks of details of 11 patients that had been copied and pasted repeatedly

Study from Iran

Another study from Iran seemed to show that ivermectin prevented people dying from Covid. 

https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-109670/v1

The records of how much iron was in patients' blood contained numbers in a sequence that was unlikely to come up naturally. 

Dr Morteza Niaee, who led the Iran study, defended the results and the methodology and disagreed with problems pointed out to him, 

adding that it was "very normal to see such randomisation" when lots of different factors were considered

Ivermectin is generally considered a safe drug, though there have been some reports of side effects. 

But indirect harm can come from giving people a false sense of security, especially if they choose ivermectin instead of seeking hospital treatment for Covid, or getting vaccinated in the first place.

Some groups regularly contain posts about conspiracy theories of ivermectin cover-ups, as well as pushing anti-vaccine sentiment or encouraging patients to leave hospital if they aren't getting the drug.

Instead of consulting a doctor, she continued with the ivermectin and got home oxygen. 

What study are the BBC talking about?

We recommend that meta-analysts who study interventions for COVID-19 should request and personally review IPD (independent patient data) in all cases, 

In a similar vein, all clinical trials published on COVID-19 should immediately follow best-practice guidelines and upload anonymised IPD so that this type of analysis can occur.

Kitasato University, based on the judgment that it is necessary to examine the clinical effect of ivermectin to prevent the spread of uncertain COVID-19,

asked Merck & Co., Inc. to conduct clinical trials of ivermectin for COVID-19 in Japan.
 
This company has priority to submit an application for an expansion of ivermectin’s indications, since the original approval for the manufacture and sale of ivermectin was conferred to it. 

However, the company said that it had no intention of conducting clinical trials.

Covid toe, caused by the immune response to the virus, not the virus itself

https://covidskinsigns.com

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjd.20707

Objectives

To study skin and blood endothelial and immune system activation

In chilblain-like lesions (CLL),

CLL in comparison with healthy controls and seasonal chilblains (SC)

(cold-induced sporadic chilblains occurring during 2015 and 2019)

Methods

Observational study

Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France

N = 50

Cytokine assays

Assessment of interferon-stimulated gene expression in whole blood

Soluble markers of endothelial activation and/or angiogenesis

Histological examinations

Lateral flow spike assay

Circulating endothelial cell counting

Statistical analysis

Results

Histological patterns were similar in CLL and SC groups

Transcriptomic signatures overlapped in both the CLL and SC groups

Type I interferon

Cytotoxic–natural killer gene signature

CLL were characterized by higher IgA tissue deposition

More complement and angiogenesis factors in CLL compared with SC

Autoimmune vasculitis

Confirmed endothelial dysfunction in CLL

Microangiopathy leading to clinical chilblains

Disrupt the thrombo-protective state of endothelial cells

Likely contributing to microvascular thrombosis

Systemic endothelial activation?

The PT ratio and aPTT were normal in all patients

Only three patients (6%) had a moderate increase in D-dimer levels

Conclusions

Inflammation in the skin in CLL

Associated with endothelial alteration

Immune infiltration of cytotoxic and type I IFN-leading to clinical manifestations

UK podiatrist Dr Ivan Bristow

like the regular chilblains typically seen during cold spells and in people who have problems with circulation - the lesions usually go away on their own. 

But some may need treatment with creams and other drugs.

The confirmation of the cause will help to develop new treatments to manage it more effectively


Dr Veronique Bataille, consultant dermatologist, British Skin Foundation

Covid toe was seen very frequently during the early phase of the pandemic, but has been less common in the current Delta variant wave.

That might be down to more people being vaccinated or having some protection against Covid from past infections. 

Presentations after vaccination are much rarer
