Millions of followers. Wonders of the World. Concerts in every corner of the globe. Who knew all this could have started in a little Yamaha Piano Store in a tiny town of Southern Utah? But that\u2019s what happened. Paul, a Yamaha dealer who dabbled in videography, Jon, a professional pianist, Al, a music producer and studio engineer, and Steve, a cellist with a creative superpower called ADHD, all serendipitously joined forces to create the most successful YouTube instrumental music group in history. The Piano Guys are watched and streamed over 3 million times EVERY DAY.\n \nThey\u2019ve made their mark by taking the piano and cello out of their concert hall context and putting them in places you\u2019d never expect to see them: On a speeding train, a cliff\u2019s edge, a beach, or in front of the Seven Wonders. The Piano Guys\u2019 mission is to inspire and spread hope through incomparably imaginative music videos filmed all over the world.\nLearn more online at ThePianoGuys.com\n \n#ImagineDragons #PianoCover #CelloCover #Piano #Cello #ThePianoGuys", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSf8xliUcDc", "date_published": "2021-10-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
