In today’s GameSpot News, DeVante talks about the GTA Trilogy being officially confirmed, no rewards or achievements for solo campaigns in Back 4 Blood, and Assassin’s Creed producer Jade Raymond teasing a new game. 

Following weeks of rumor and speculation, Rockstar Games has officially announced a new Grand Theft Auto remaster package featuring GTA III, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas.  The GTA Trilogy: The Definitive Edition comes with updated and improved versions of those three games. The bundle will be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and on PC through the Rockstar Games Launcher later this year.

Back 4 Blood is a social game, and developer Turtle Rock Studios doesn't want players to forget that. While playing through a campaign match with others will let players earn supply points, which can be used to purchase cards and cosmetics, the game's solo mode totally cuts players off from all rewards. One upside of Solo Campaign is that players get to use any solo card decks they make, which have access to a wide variety of cards compared to regular campaign decks.

Assassin's Creed producer Jade Raymond has teased the first game from her new studio, Haven, which has aligned itself exclusively with PlayStation. Haven's first game is a new IP that will seem to have an emphasis on social elements, self-expression, and remix concepts. Raymond said Haven's first game is going to be "really ambitious" and showcase what the PS5 is capable of and that the game's file size might be massive.

## Far Cry 6 Post-Credits Scene Explained

A post-credits scene in Far Cry 6 answers some questions about the possible return of Far Cry 3 villain Vaas, while raising a few more.

For a while now, fans have speculated that Far Cry 6 would bring back fan-favorite villain Vaas, one of the antagonists of Far Cry 3. Vaas is the guy who pretty much defined what has become the archetypal Far Cry villain. He's charismatic, scary, and ruthless, and he has some long and fun bad guy monologues. Hints that Vaas was returning have circulated for more than a year, with actor Michael Mando even suggesting he'd reprise the role, and that's fueled a lot of fan theories about the villain's role in Far Cry 6. 

Ubisoft revealed earlier this year that Vaas, as well as Far Cry 4 villain Pagan Min and Far Cry 5 villain Joseph Seed, would be playable characters in a Far Cry 6 post-launch DLC expansion. But as it turns out, there's more to the Vaas story than whatever is going on in that expansion--which seems altogether dream-like and might possibly exist outside the realm of Far Cry 6's "real world."

Though it can be really fun, especially when it descends into absolute chaos, Far Cry 6 is overstuffed and disjointed, with so many ideas that it's tough to focus.
