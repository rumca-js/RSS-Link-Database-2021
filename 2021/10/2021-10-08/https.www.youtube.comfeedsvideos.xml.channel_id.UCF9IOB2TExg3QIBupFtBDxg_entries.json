to buy it, including preparations meant for animals.\n\nThe BBC can reveal that more than a third of 26 major trials of the drug for use on Covid have serious errors or signs of potential fraud.

Twitter\n\nThey've been working together remotely on an informal and voluntary basis during the pandemic. \n\nReference please\n\nThe BBC can reveal that more than a third of 26 major trials of the drug for use on Covid have serious errors or signs of potential fraud. \n\nNone of the rest show convincing evidence of ivermectin's effectiveness. \n\nDr Kyle Sheldrick, one of the group investigating the studies, said they had not found \"a single clinical trial\" claiming to show that ivermectin prevented Covid deaths that did not contain \"either obvious signs of fabrication or errors so critical they invalidate the study\".\n\nOut of a total of 26 studies examined, there was evidence in five that the data may have been faked\n\nOn top of these flawed trials, there were 14 authors of studies who failed to send data back. \n\nThe independent scientists have flagged this as a possible indicator of fraud. \n\nThe sample of research papers examined by the independent group also contains some high-quality studies from around the world. \n\nA recent study in Lebanon was found to have blocks of details of 11 patients that had been copied and pasted repeatedly \n\nthey have submitted a retraction to the scientific journal which published it\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34073401/\n\nStudy from Iran\n\nAnother study from Iran seemed to show that ivermectin prevented people dying from Covid. \n\nhttps://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-109670/v1\n\nThe records of how much iron was in patients' blood contained numbers in a sequence that was unlikely to come up naturally. \n\nDr Morteza Niaee, who led the Iran study, defended the results and the methodology and disagreed with problems pointed out to him, \n\nadding that it was \"very normal to see such randomisation\" when lots of different factors were considered\n\nIvermectin is generally considered a safe drug, though there have been some reports of side effects. \n\nBut indirect harm can come from giving people a false sense of security, especially if they choose ivermectin instead of seeking hospital treatment for Covid, or getting vaccinated in the first place.\n\nSome groups regularly contain posts about conspiracy theories of ivermectin cover-ups, as well as pushing anti-vaccine sentiment or encouraging patients to leave hospital if they aren't getting the drug. \n\nSouth African nurse dies\n\nInstead of consulting a doctor, she continued with the ivermectin and got home oxygen. \n\nWhat study are the BBC talking

recommend that meta-analysts who study interventions for COVID-19 should request and personally review IPD (independent patient data) in all cases, \n\nIn a similar vein, all clinical trials published on COVID-19 should immediately follow best-practice guidelines and upload anonymised IPD so that this type of analysis can occur.

application for an expansion of ivermectin\u2019s indications, since the original approval for the manufacture and sale of ivermectin was conferred to it. \n\nHowever, the company said that it had no
