Learn the tips and tricks you need to work as a team in Guardians of the Galaxy's Combat System.

Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy puts you in the hover boots of Star-Lord and asks you to lead a team of the Galaxy’s deadliest heroes, Drax, Rocket, Gamora, and Groot. You might not get to control the rest of the guardian’s directly, but don’t be fooled, you have to work as a team in order to make the most of the game’s combat.

There’s a lot of different attack properties and status effects at play and I found it took me a while to really get the hang of it. I’m here to lay it all down for you, so that you’ll have more of a leg up than I did when you start the game.

Over the years veteran Battlefield players have developed a lot of knowledge, tricks, and some unspoken rules. It’s time to pass those skills on to a new generation of Battlefield 2042 players. Here are things every Battlefield player knows that can make you better at the game.

Battlefield 2042 releases in November and may attract a lot of new players, including those coming over from Modern Warfare 2019, who aren’t familiar with the series. Battlefield is a franchise that doesn’t hold your hand as much as Call Of Duty and will let you get yourself into bad situations easily so it’s important to know what you’re doing. The sandbox nature of the game opens up a lot of clever tips and tricks and unexpected things you can do with class gadgets, weapons, vehicles, and destruction. It’s even more complex now that the new specialist system, with things like turrets and grappling hooks, has upended the older class system that itself evolved and changed from 1942, Battlefield 2, 2142, Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 or 4, and World War settings. 

In this video we’re rounding up some of the tips, tricks, and knowledge that Battlefield veterans have gathered over the last two decades in order to catch you up ahead of 2042’s launch. You’ll learn about clever ways to use vehicles, how players use C4 to grief their opponents, why certain gear is misunderstood, how to increase your chances of bailing from a bad situation successfully, odd ways players might try to communicate with you, how to not fall for mind games people play, and why you should try sticking everything to everything. 

These skills will probably come in handy across the three modes coming out at launch which include All-Out-Warfare, Hazard Zone, and Portal. We have only begun to dig into specialists and gadgets with many more releasing over the course of four Battle Passes. Make sure to tell us about your experiences with the Battlefield 2042 Open beta and head on over to GameSpot.com for ongoing coverage.
