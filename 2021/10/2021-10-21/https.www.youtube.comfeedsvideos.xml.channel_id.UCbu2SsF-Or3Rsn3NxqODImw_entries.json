It\u2019s time to pass those skills on to a new generation of Battlefield 2042 players. Here are things every Battlefield player knows that can make you better at the game.\n\nBattlefield 2042 releases in November and may attract a lot of new players, including those coming over from Modern Warfare 2019, who aren\u2019t familiar with the series. Battlefield is a franchise that doesn\u2019t hold your hand as much as Call Of Duty and will let you get yourself into bad situations easily so it\u2019s important to know what you\u2019re doing. The sandbox nature of the game opens up a lot of clever tips and tricks and unexpected things you can do with class gadgets, weapons, vehicles, and destruction. It\u2019s even more complex now that the new specialist system, with things like turrets and grappling hooks, has upended the older class system that itself evolved and changed from 1942, Battlefield 2, 2142, Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 or 4, and World War settings. \n\nIn this video we\u2019re rounding up some of the tips, tricks, and knowledge that Battlefield veterans have gathered over the last two decades in order to catch you up ahead of 2042\u2019s launch. You\u2019ll learn about clever ways to use vehicles, how players use C4 to grief their opponents, why certain gear is misunderstood, how to increase your chances of bailing from a bad situation successfully, odd ways players might try to communicate with you, how to not fall for mind games people play, and why you should try sticking everything to everything. \n\nThese skills will probably come in handy across the three modes coming out at launch which include All-Out-Warfare, Hazard Zone, and Portal. We have only begun to dig into specialists and gadgets with many more releasing over the course of four Battle Passes.
