Moderna and Johnson & Johnson can now have boosters

Rochelle Walensky

Choose any of the three boosters now authorized, regardless of original shot

The evidence shows that all three COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the United States are safe,

as demonstrated by the over 400 million vaccine doses already given

And, they are all highly effective in reducing the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, even in the midst of the widely circulating delta variant

FDA, did not recommend any particular combination of vaccines and boosters

to switch or to stick

CDC, still working it out

Advisory panel member Pablo J. Sanchez, pediatrician, Ohio State

I agree that those who received a [Johnson & Johnson] vaccine should receive a second dose, 

I would prefer that those individuals get an mRNA vaccine

FDA has authorized

A third shot of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech

anyone 65 and older

any adults at high risk of severe, underlying conditions, job exposure, institutional settings

At least six months since their second dose

Johnson & Johnson recipients

Anyone 18 and older

At least two months since getting the shot

In the fully vaccinated

105 million people, Pfizer series

70 million people, Moderna series

15 million people, Johnson & Johnson single shot
More than 11 million people boosted so far

Risk posed by further viral evolution,

that becomes dominant globally is a very real possibility

Therefore need for:

Capacity to monitor for variants

Conduct predictive vaccinology

Winter and into 2022

Hospital admissions above the level seen in January 2021 are increasingly unlikely

Uncertainties, behaviour change and waning immunity 

Co-circulation and co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and influenza

Symptoms of any respiratory infection, stay at home 

Russia

Deaths, + 1,000 per day

Vologda, Hospital Number One

26% of patients vaccinated

Covid patients, 750
Unvaccinated, 700

The scale of new infections and deaths has alarmed authorities so much that 

All workplaces, shut down for a week from the start of November

Moscow, closing non-essential services for 11 days from next Thursday

Very low vaccine uptake

Years of scepticism of authorities

Anti-vaxxers, social media

Also a lot of people have been asking about my supplements and Ivermectin. Here are some good studies on the benefits.
