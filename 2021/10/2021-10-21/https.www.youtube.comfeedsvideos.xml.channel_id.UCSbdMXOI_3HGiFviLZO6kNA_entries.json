Today I have a video on the Varjo Aero. AS OF THE POSTING OF THIS VIDEO (subject to change as tech changes) this is probably my favorite VR headset I have tried even though it has some massive flaws. VR Technology is so much further along than we thing and this device is very exciting. I hope you enjoy my video on it and my views regarding it. I had so much fun testing this headset.
