Hello, today I break down Facebook change to Meta and Meta's commitment to the metaverse. There is so much to unpack here. One one hand Meta is offering to build our virtual world and provide jobs and money to anyone and everyone in it. On the other hand, this isn't yours our my metaverse. This isn't built by the people for the people. This doesn't feel right and there is everything at stake here. Please let me know your thoughts.
