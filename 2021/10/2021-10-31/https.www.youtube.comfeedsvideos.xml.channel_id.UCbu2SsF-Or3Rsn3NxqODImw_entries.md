Xbox has had some excellent console exclusives over the past few years, a number that's likely going to grow during the Xbox Series X|S's lifecycle given Microsoft's string of studio acquisitions. But that's the future--we don't know for sure what will and what won't be dope. All we can do is look at what's currently out, and decide which games are our favorites.

In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Nintendo's Switch Online Expansion Pack trailer becoming it's most disliked video ever, leaked details about 2022's Call of Duty, the reason Roblox suffered a long outage, and why Fortnite may not see an official release in China.

In this video, DeVante talks about the trailer for the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack becoming the company's most disliked video ever on YouTube. The trailer has over 120,000 dislikes at the time of writing and a mere 17,000 likes, with a total count of 1.15 million views.

DeVante also talks about new leaked details about 2022's Call of Duty game. The game could have a morality system like Red Dead Redemption 2, and the campaign will apparently feature a new level of gore for the series. As reported previously, 2022's game is rumored to be a sequel to 2019's Modern Warfare from Infinity Ward, focusing on Colombian drug cartels.

Later in the video, Roblox Corp. CEO David Baszucki explains the game's weekend long outage. And China will reportedly not be getting an official release of Fortnite following two years of testing.
