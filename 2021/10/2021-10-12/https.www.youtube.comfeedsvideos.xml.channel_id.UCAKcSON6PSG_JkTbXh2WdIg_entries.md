This week, Mary Lucia has something for those fascinated by the history of Minneapolis: "Return To Skid Row," a Twin Cities PBS Original production.

At the film's core is "Skid Row," a color film shot on a 16 mm movie camera by bar owner and amateur photographer John Bacich between the years 1955 and 1961. The footage was shot with no sound, yet Bacich provides his own narration — and because Bacich was part of the community, he knows several of the people on camera by name. 

In "Return to Skid Row," Bacich's original footage is bookended by commentary from  authors James Eli Shiffer and Stewart Van Cleve, and University of Minnesota professor Brenda Child. Mary Lucia's takeaway from this commentary is "you can knock down buildings, and you can gentrify certain things. But what you're what you're trying to do is get rid of a community — and it may be unsavory — but it was nonetheless a community of people." 

"Return to Skid Row" is available for streaming on PBS.org as well as on the TPT Originals YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/w-o79czcfKE

Two years ago this week, Louisville, Ky., rockers White Reaper visited The Current studio. At the time, the band had just signed to major label Elektra Records, and they were looking ahead to the release of their album, "You Deserve Love," on Oct. 18, 2019. Two years on, White Reaper are dipping their toes back in the touring pool, and they're set to play the Shaky Knees Festival in Atlanta on October 22. Until then, here are three songs by White Reaper, recorded during that October 2019 session at The Current.
