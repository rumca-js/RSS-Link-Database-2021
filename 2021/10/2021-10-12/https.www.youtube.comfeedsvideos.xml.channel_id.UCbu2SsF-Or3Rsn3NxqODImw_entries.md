## Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl Look To Evolve Upon The Originals' Mechanics

The remakes for Pokémon Generation IV seem to be aimed at addressing Diamond/Pearl's most obvious shortcomings.

Ahead of the release for Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, developer ILCA and publisher Nintendo have marketed the two remakes as faithful adaptations of the original Generation IV games. I recently attended a preview event for the duo where I got to see B. Diamond in action, and although these remakes look faithful to the original games, I'm not so sure that they'll feel as faithful. If anything, the changes made in these remakes seem to make for a far more approachable experience--I think players are going to find these games to be a lot easier to get through than the original Diamond/Pearl.

In terms of overall structure and presentation, yes, B. Diamond/S. Pearl are faithful adaptations of the original Diamond/Pearl. Unlike Sword/Shield with its over-the-shoulder perspective, realistically proportioned characters, and occasional free camera moments, B. Diamond/S. Pearl is presented in Pokemon's traditional top-down isometric perspective with a more chibi-like visual style and no free camera.

In this episode of Gaming Mysteries, Dave goes over some of Dark Souls best known secrets. Who is Gwyn's Firstborn Son, What does the Pendant Do, What is the Skull at Ash Lake, and Who is the Narrator? Dive into some of Dark Souls Mysteries and find out which are solved and which remain unsolved!

Thanks to its unique world and deep lore, Dark Souls fans have dove into every aspect of the game. We've found cut content showcasing the Witch of Izalith's original boss fight, questioned if Manus is the Furtive Pygmy, and even had some of our questions answered in Dark Souls 3. But, there are still many burning Dark Souls questions and mysteries.

At this point, some of these mysteries are solved, but there still remain many that we don't know the answers to, and many still theorize about. How is Velka related to the overall plot of the game? Where did Gwynevere flee to? And, many questions this video tackles, such as who is Gwyn's Firstborn son, and is this related to Solaire or Andre of Astora? Does the pendant actually do anything, or is it more of Hidetaka Miyazaki's trickery? Soulsborne is full of these mysteries, and today we focus on Dark Souls 1.

We recently took part in a hands-on preview event for Forza Horizon 5 where we got to play the racing game's opening prologue and sample a few story missions before being set free to roam the open world of Mexico.

The demo also let us try a series of races involving different types of cars in a variety of settings. All of these were impressive with their attention to detail and core driving mechanics, but our favorite part of our limited time with Forza Horizon 5 was exploring the open road and experiencing the world at my own pace.

In this video, Persia talks about how the not-so-open world will work in Pokemon Legends: Arceus, a possible Fortnite movie, and persistent Diablo 2 Resurrection server issues.

While many fans have compared Pokemon Legends: Arceus to the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the world may not work the way players may think. Instead, the world will operate similarly to the Monster Hunter series. In a statement to Kotaku, The Pokemon Company states that players set out from a central hub village, before accepting missions and venturing forth into different "open areas" of the Hisui region.

Fortnite may currently be unavailable on iOS and Google Play stores, but Epic Games is now considering a Fortnite movie as a trio of former LucasFilm employees have joined the company. There have already been discussions about a Fortnite movie according to a report by The Information.

Diablo II: Resurrected launched over two weeks ago and is still suffering from many of the same login issues, with the game even going offline for multiple hours over the weekend for emergency maintenance. As of this afternoon, Blizzard said on Twitter that players should begin to see improvements.
