This new bundle comes with updated and improved versions of GTA III, Vice City or San Andreas and will be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\n\nDeVante also talks about Fortnite teasing an upcoming collab with Among Us. The tease came in the form of a Twitter exchange after Fortnite released it\u2019s update 18.20 patch notes. The update also includes a new return system for unwanted cosmetic purchases.\u00a0\n\nLater in the video, League Of Legends All Chat is removed from the game after reported of abuse over the past year.\u00a0\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:15 - Original GTA Trilogy Being Removed\n01:02 - Fortnite teases Among Us collab\u00a0\n01:58 - Fortnite refund changes\n02:41 - League of Legends removes All Chat\n03:37 - Try Riders Republic on PC today only\u00a0\n03:55 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnIMcER_DkI", "date_published": "2021-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl Look To Evolve Upon The Originals' Mechanics", "description": "The remakes for Pok\u00e9mon Generation IV seem to be aimed at addressing Diamond/Pearl's most obvious shortcomings.\n\nAhead of the release for Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, developer ILCA and publisher Nintendo have marketed the two remakes as faithful adaptations of the original Generation IV games. I recently attended a preview event for the duo where I got to see B. Diamond in action, and although these remakes look faithful to the original games, I'm not so sure that they'll feel as faithful. If anything, the changes made in these remakes seem to make for a far more approachable experience--I think players are going to find these games to be a lot easier to get through than the original Diamond/Pearl.\n\nIn terms of overall structure and presentation, yes, B. Diamond/S. Pearl are faithful adaptations of the original Diamond/Pearl. Unlike Sword/Shield with its over-the-shoulder perspective, realistically proportioned characters, and occasional free camera moments, B. Diamond/S. Pearl is presented in Pokemon's traditional top-down isometric perspective with a more chibi-like visual style and no free camera.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mePFpBEa4w", "date_published": "2021-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Dark Souls: Biggest Mysteries Explained", "description": "In this episode of Gaming Mysteries, Dave goes over some of Dark Souls best known secrets. Who is Gwyn's Firstborn Son, What does the Pendant Do, What is the Skull at Ash Lake, and Who is the Narrator? Dive into some of Dark Souls Mysteries and find out which are solved and which remain unsolved!\n\nThanks to its unique world and deep lore, Dark Souls fans have dove into every aspect of the game. We've found cut content showcasing the Witch of Izalith's original boss fight, questioned if Manus is the Furtive Pygmy, and even had some of our questions answered in Dark Souls 3. But, there are still many burning Dark Souls questions and mysteries.\n\nAt this point, some of these mysteries are solved, but there still remain many that we don't know the answers to, and many still theorize about. How is Velka related to the overall plot of the game? Where did Gwynevere flee to? And, many questions this video tackles, such as who is Gwyn's Firstborn son, and is this related to Solaire or Andre of Astora? Does the pendant actually do anything, or is it more of Hidetaka Miyazaki's trickery? Soulsborne is full of these mysteries, and today we focus on Dark Souls 1.\n\n#DarkSouls", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgzAZRXy8Uo", "date_published": "2021-10-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Forza Horizon 5 Hands On Preview", "description": "We recently took part in a hands-on preview event for Forza Horizon 5 where we got to play the racing game's opening prologue and sample a few story missions before being set free to roam the open world of Mexico. \nCredits: Eddie Makuch, Richard li, kurt indovina\n\nThe demo also let us try a series of races involving different types of cars in a variety of settings.

Instead, the world will operate similarly to the Monster Hunter series.

There have already been discussions about a Fortnite movie according to a report by The Information.\n\nDiablo II: Resurrected launched over two weeks ago and is still suffering from many of the same login issues, with the game even going offline for multiple hours over the weekend for emergency maintenance.
