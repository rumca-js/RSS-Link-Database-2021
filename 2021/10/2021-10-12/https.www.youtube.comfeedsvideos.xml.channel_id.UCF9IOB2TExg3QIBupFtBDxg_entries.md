Coronavirus: lessons learned to date 

https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/7496/documents/78687/default/

in 2020 the UK did significantly worse in terms of covid deaths than many countries—especially compared to those in East Asia

The UK’s pandemic planning was too narrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model which failed to learn the lessons from SARS, MERS and Ebola. 

In the first three months the strategy reflected official scientific advice to the Government which was accepted and implemented. 

When the Government moved from the ‘contain’ stage to the ‘delay’ stage, 

that approach involved trying to manage the spread of covid through the population rather than to stop it spreading altogether. 

This amounted in practice to accepting that herd immunity by infection was the inevitable outcome, 

The UK, along with many other countries in Europe and North America made a serious early error in adopting this fatalistic approach 

and not considering a more emphatic and rigorous approach to stopping the spread of the virus as adopted by many East and South East Asian countries. 

The fact that the UK approach reflected a consensus between official scientific advisers and the Government indicates a degree of groupthink 

that was present at the time which meant we were not as open to approaches being taken elsewhere as we should have been.
