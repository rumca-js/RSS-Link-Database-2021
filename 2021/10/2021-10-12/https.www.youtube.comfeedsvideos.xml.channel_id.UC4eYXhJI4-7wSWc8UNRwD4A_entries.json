It's a production choice that completely works and, in a way, reflects Nicki Nicole at large, as an artist born in 2000 and with a connection to sounds and styles beyond her years.\n\nAt multiple points throughout the performance, Nicki points and beckons to the audience, inviting them into her world, her lyrics, her sound. Every track carries a certain brand of swagger whether it be the intensity of her second song \"Mala Vida\" or her effortless, confident freestyle. Even when she slows it down, on \"Parte de Mi,\" strings and piano create an arresting connection between us and her \u2013 and her final song, \"Baby,\" is a bombastic head-bopper, enhanced by her deeply groove-oriented band, which includes everything from an accordion to a mandolin.\n\nFittingly, Nicki Nicole has a tattoo on her neck which, in English, reads \"bulls***.\" She has said before that the tattoo represents her need to break free of the labels applied by both her culture and industry as a young, Argentine female R&B artist. If her concert is any indication, Nicki Nicole is here to stay, while moving ever further away from any preconceived notions of her artistry \u2013 the \"bulls***.\"\n\nSET LIST\n* \"Colocao\"\n* \"Mala Vida\"\n* \"Wapo Traketero\"\n* \"Parte de Mi\"\n* Freestyle\n* \"Baby\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n* Nicki Nicole: vocals\n* Andres Cortes: electric guitar, mandolin, guitar\n* Ayelen Zucker: vocals, percussion\n* Camila Ibarra: vocals, percussion\n* Flor Iribarne: piano\n* Jeremias Segall: drums\n* Juan Gimenez Kuj: bass, double bass\n* Lautaro Greco: bandone\u00f3n\n* Alma Quiroga: I viol\u00edn\n* Natalia Cabello: II viol\u00edn\n* Carla Regio: viola\n* Jacqueline Oroc: cello\n\nCREDITS\n* Producer: Federico Lauria\n* Executive Producer: Matias Santoro, Tito Leconte / Dale Play Records\n* Video Director: Jess \u201cLa Polaca\u201d Praznik AD: Mariana Point\n* Art Director: Juli Duich\n* Director of Photography: Patricio Deart \n* ST: Cucchi Pagani, In\u00e9s Pizarro, Mae Ludue\u00f1a\n* Color: Guttcolor\n* Production and Musical Direction: Juan Gimenez Kuj, Pedro Pasquale\n* Arrangement for strings and piano \"Part of me\": Damian Mahler \n* Master and Mix Recording Engineer: Mariano Bilinkis\n* Recording and Editing Assistant: Manuel Cano\n* Technical Production: Mart\u00edn JR Ranea\n* Monitor Engineer: Francisco Trillini\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n* Producer: Anamaria Sayre\n* Video Producer: Kara Frame\n* Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n* Alt.Latino 'El Tiny' Team: Felix Contreras, Reanna Cruz, Ana\u00efs Laurent, Stefanie Fernandez\n* Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Maia Stern, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\n* Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n* Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#eltiny #tinydesk #nickynicole #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG6O-Qq79G0", "date_published": "2021-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
