The footage was shot with no sound, yet Bacich provides his own narration \u2014 and because Bacich was part of the community, he knows several of the people on camera by name. \n\nIn \"Return to Skid Row,\" Bacich's original footage is bookended by commentary from  authors James Eli Shiffer and Stewart Van Cleve, and University of Minnesota professor Brenda Child. Mary Lucia's takeaway from this commentary is \"you can knock down buildings, and you can gentrify certain things. But what you're what you're trying to do is get rid of a community \u2014 and it may be unsavory \u2014 but it was nonetheless a community of people.\" \n\n\"Return to Skid Row\" is available for streaming on PBS.org as well as on the TPT Originals YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/w-o79czcfKE\n\nFind the complete Listen to Looch playlist here:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYClJc3TpV5J_sXyCfes-p6vCgOpCmleh\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#minneapolishistory #tptoriginals #marylucia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBnQ2bXFC9g", "date_published": "2021-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "White Reaper - three songs at The Current (2019)", "description": "Two years ago this week, Louisville, Ky., rockers White Reaper visited The Current studio. At the time, the band had just signed to major label Elektra Records, and they were looking ahead to the release of their album, \"You Deserve Love,\" on Oct. 18, 2019. Two years on, White Reaper are dipping their toes back in the touring pool, and they're set to play the Shaky Knees Festival in Atlanta on October 22. Until then, here are three songs by White Reaper, recorded during that October 2019 session at The Current. \n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Might Be Right\"\n3:53 \"Raw\"\n6:35 \"1F\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nTony Esposito \u2013 guitar, vocals\nRyan Hater \u2013 keyboard\nHunter Thompson \u2013 guitar\nNick Wilkerson \u2013 drums, percussion\nSam Wilkerson \u2013 bass\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Helen Teague\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Jesse Wiza\n\nFIND MORE:\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/05/02/the-guys-from-white-reaper-just-want-to-rock\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/10/12/white-reaper-you-deserve-love-might-be-right-studio-session\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#whitereaper", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo6xAtbw9qY", "date_published": "2021-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Michigander - two live performances (2021)", "description": "Monday night, Michigander will perform at the 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis.
