Gruden resigned Monday as head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders after further reports emerged from the New York Times about his use of homophobic and misogynistic language in emails while he worked as an ESPN analyst. He apologized in a statement issued by the Raiders: \"I love the Raiders and do not want to be a distraction. Thank you to all the players, coaches, staff, and fans of Raider Nation. I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt anyone.\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/11/opinions/jon-gruden-racism-nfl-demaurice-smith-joseph/index.html", "date_published": "2021-10-12 04:05:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss", "title": "France to ban plastic packaging for fruit and vegetables from January", "description": "France will ban plastic packaging for nearly all fruit and vegetables from January 2022 in a bid to reduce plastic waste, the environment ministry said on Monday.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/europe/france-ban-plastic-packaging-intl-hnk/index.html", "date_published": "2021-10-12 04:01:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss", "title": "China says it held beach landing drills in province opposite Taiwan", "description": "China's military said on Monday it had carried out beach landing and assault drills in the province directly across the sea from Taiwan, though it did not link the exercises to current tensions with Taipei.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/11/asia/china-taiwan-military-intl-hnk/index.html", "date_published": "2021-10-12 03:03:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss", "title": "Couple's wedding cake fiasco draws comparison to 'Cruella'", "description": "A wedding cake fiasco has the bride seeing spots.
