This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.

Pandora Papers exposed a lot of things, and many of them were shocking, but the one that wasn't---the super rich are hypocrites and corrupt it turns out.
