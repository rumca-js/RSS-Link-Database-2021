One year ago, it was quite a different story as touring was not possible for musicians. Ever innovative, Sylvan Esso recorded a performance, specially for The Current, right in their home studio in Durham, N.C., in August 2020. The three-song set includes a track from each of Sylvan Esso's albums to date, starting with a track from 2020's \"Free Love\" before tracks from their 2014 self-titled release and 2017's \"What Now.\" \n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Ferris Wheel\"\n3:14 \"Coffee\"\n7:39 \"Radio\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nAmelia Meath \u2013 vocals\nNick Sanborn \u2013 keys, beats\n\nFIND MORE:\n2014 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/amp/story/2014/07/28/sylvan-esso-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2018 concert review: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/07/review-and-photos-sylvan-esso-spark-a-surly-dance-party-in-minneapolis\n2020 virtual session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/08/18/virtual-session-sylvan-esso\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#sylvanesso", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTYROPxGa2A", "date_published": "2021-10-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Courtney Barnett & Kurt Vile - three songs at The Current (2017)", "description": "Four years ago, on October 25, 2017, Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile visited The Current for a session in the studio. \n\nWas it any wonder that Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile became friends? Having shared mutual friends, an overlapping touring schedule and common musical interests, it seemed inevitable. \"We started running into each other at shows and festivals and stuff, and we had some mutual Melbourne friends, where I'm from,\" Barnett said during her and Vile's 2017 session at The Current.\n\nThe friends quickly became musical collaborators, and their resulting album, \"Lotta Sea Lice,\" is evidence of their productive cross-pollination. \"I've worked with different people in my life,\" Vile said, \"and [Barnett is] the ultimate because I got to make a whole record with her, which I wouldn't have been able to do with others I've played with in the past, because it didn't click in the same way.\"\n\nWatch three songs performed by Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile during their October 2017 visit to The Current.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n00:00 \"Over Everything\"\n05:15 \"Continental Breakfast\"\n10:05 \"Let It Go\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nCourtney Barnett \u2013 vocals, guitar\nKurt Vile \u2013 vocals, guitar\nJanet Weiss \u2013 drums \nRob Laakso \u2013 guitar \n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Jay Anker\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Riley Bruestle\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2018 Kurt Vile studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/12/19/kurt-vile-performs-a-solo-acoustic-set-at-the-current\n2018 Courtney Barnett studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/07/21/courtney-barnett-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2017 Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/10/25/kurt-vile-and-courtney-barnett-bring-their-friendship-and-music-to-the-current\n2016 Courtney Barnett studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/04/28/courtney-barnett-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2015 Courtney Barnett at Rock the Garden:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/06/30/courtney-barnett-live-at-rock-the-garden-2015\n2013 Kurt Vile studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/03/04/kurt-vile\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#courtneybarnett #kurtvile", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFSNJnxELbA", "date_published": "2021-10-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
