There's so many games on Game Pass it can be a little overwhelming. Add Game Pass Ultimate and EA Play to the mix, and the sea of games to play gets a lot bigger. It can be hard to narrow down what to play first, so we put together a list showcasing some of the best games to play right now on Xbox Game Pass.

If you're in the mood for something scary to match the Halloween season, there's plenty of horror games on offer like the PT inspired Visage, or the Left 4 Dead spiritual successor Back 4 Blood. But if horror isn't your bag, there's more charming and heartfelt games like The Good Life or Psychonauts 2. There's even classics like Myst, or the highly meditative Tetris Effect: Connected. Suffice to say, you have options.

The library is ever-growing, so this list is only a snapshot of the 100+ games Game Pass has. For our other list on great games to consider playing, check out this video: https://youtu.be/70Vd2mGXhJY

## N64 on Switch Has Some Issues | GameSpot News

In today’s episode of GameSpot News, Persia talks about what problems N64 games are having on the Nintendo Switch, how A Quiet Place will be adapted to video games, what’s in the Phasmophobia Haloween update, and how Far Cry 6 is laying on the guilt.

It’s another episode with Persia covering what you need to know about video games today. Nintendo Switch Online has released a bunch of N64 titles that you can play on the go, such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and there have been some issues with the games. The largest problem is button mapping, with the N64’s six buttons having to be laid over the Nintendo Switch controller, which only has four. That is creating awkward and, for some, unplayable control schemes for titles such as Sin and Punishment. Some games also lack features that used to be available using the N64 controller pack, which was a device inserted into the older controller that acted as a memory card. That means the games are seeing missing functionality, such as the ability to race against your own ghost driver in Mario Kart 64. 

A Quiet Place is becoming a single-player, story-driven horror game. Paramount’s movie about a family trapped in a future where aliens hunt down anyone who makes a sound is now being adapted into a game by Saber Interactive, iLLOGIKA, and EP1T0ME. The development team has also pulled in employees who worked on Rainbow Six and Far Cry. The story will not focus on the family seen in the movie, but instead will tell its own story. If there’s one thing we learned from the movie, it’s that you should definitely go chasing waterfalls… if you want to have any conversations with other characters, anyway.  

Phasmophobia is releasing a huge “Nightmare” update for Halloween, and it includes the new Maple Lodge Campsite map. There are four new ghost types as well: Onryo, The Twins, Obake, and Raiju, which players will run into more frequently during the Halloween event. The update also adds weather, Nightmare-level difficulty, mini-map changes, and balance tweaks.
Finally, if you dropped off of Far Cry 6, the game might have something to say about it. Players have reported getting emails from antagonist Anton Castillo telling them they can do better. For more news head on over to GameSpot.com and YouTube.com/GameSpot.

Call of Duty: Warzone has made strides as one of the largest free-to-play games ever. Over the last year and a half, Warzone's success has fluctuated with integrations both from Black Ops Cold War and Vanguard, hacker accounts, and more. Let's reflect on Warzone and see where it started, where it's at, and where it could go next. 

TIMESTAMPS:
00:34 - Where it Started
02:12 - Where it's Been
05:03 - Where it's Going

In less than 2 years, Call of Duty: Warzone has left its impact on the Battle Royale gaming space. After the successful launch, the free-to-play title soared in popularity with fans from all walks of FPS and in mere months, player count rose to the multi-millions. Today, well after the initial hype has come and gone, we’ve seen the good and bad size of Warzone. With plans to eliminate hackers and an all new Vanguard Pacific map on the way, what does the future of Warzone look like?    

In the beginning, Warzone was undeniably a runaway success. Unfortunately, when issues like hacker accounts and overpowered weapons began to plague the game, the experience quickly became unfavorable. With continued balancing, Warzone remains a somewhat stable experience. Events like “The Haunting” and “Know Your History” served as short distractions that mixed up gameplay and even had players working together, but only time will tell if the overall success of warzone can hold.
