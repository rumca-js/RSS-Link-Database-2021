Don't Miss These", "description": "There's so many games on Game Pass it can be a little overwhelming. Add Game Pass Ultimate and EA Play to the mix, and the sea of games to play gets a lot bigger. It can be hard to narrow down what to play first, so we put together a list showcasing some of the best games to play right now on Xbox Game Pass.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something scary to match the Halloween season, there's plenty of horror games on offer like the PT inspired Visage, or the Left 4 Dead spiritual successor Back 4 Blood. But if horror isn't your bag, there's more charming and heartfelt games like The Good Life or Psychonauts 2. There's even classics like Myst, or the highly meditative Tetris Effect: Connected. Suffice to say, you have options.\n\nThe library is ever-growing, so this list is only a snapshot of the 100+ games Game Pass has.

Nintendo Switch Online has released a bunch of N64 titles that you can play on the go, such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and there have been some issues with the games. The largest problem is button mapping, with the N64\u2019s six buttons having to be laid over the Nintendo Switch controller, which only has four. That is creating awkward and, for some, unplayable control schemes for titles such as Sin and Punishment. Some games also lack features that used to be available using the N64 controller pack, which was a device inserted into the older controller that acted as a memory card. That means the games are seeing missing functionality, such as the ability to race against your own ghost driver in Mario Kart 64.\u00a0\n\nA Quiet Place is becoming a single-player, story-driven horror game. Paramount\u2019s movie about a family trapped in a future where aliens hunt down anyone who makes a sound is now being adapted into a game by Saber Interactive, iLLOGIKA, and EP1T0ME. The development team has also pulled in employees who worked on Rainbow Six and Far Cry. The story will not focus on the family seen in the movie, but instead will tell its own story. If there\u2019s one thing we learned from the movie, it\u2019s that you should definitely go chasing waterfalls\u2026 if you want to have any conversations with other characters, anyway.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPhasmophobia is releasing a huge \u201cNightmare\u201d update for Halloween, and it includes the new Maple Lodge Campsite map. There are four new ghost types as well: Onryo, The Twins, Obake, and Raiju, which players will run into more frequently during the Halloween event. The update also adds weather, Nightmare-level difficulty, mini-map changes, and balance tweaks.\nFinally, if you dropped off of Far Cry 6, the game might have something to say about it. Players have reported getting emails from antagonist Anton Castillo telling them they can do better.

Over the last year and a half, Warzone's success has fluctuated with integrations both from Black Ops Cold War and Vanguard, hacker accounts, and more. Let's reflect on Warzone and see where it started, where it's at, and where it could go next. \n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:34 - Where it Started\n02:12 - Where it's Been\n05:03 - Where it's Going\n\nIn less than 2 years, Call of Duty: Warzone has left its impact on the Battle Royale gaming space. After the successful launch, the free-to-play title soared in popularity with fans from all walks of FPS and in mere months, player count rose to the multi-millions. Today, well after the initial hype has come and gone, we\u2019ve seen the good and bad size of Warzone. With plans to eliminate hackers and an all new Vanguard Pacific map on the way, what does the future of Warzone look like?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn the beginning, Warzone was undeniably a runaway success. Unfortunately, when issues like hacker accounts and overpowered weapons began to plague the game, the experience quickly became unfavorable. With continued balancing, Warzone remains a somewhat stable experience. Events like \u201cThe Haunting\u201d and \u201cKnow Your History\u201d served as short distractions that mixed up gameplay and even had players working together, but only time will tell if the overall success of warzone can hold.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more videos about your favorite first-person shooters like Call of Duty, Halo, and Battlefield, stay tuned to GameSpot\u2019s YouTube page and GameSpot.com for all the latest updates.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGPWhgXWFys", "date_published": "2021-10-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
