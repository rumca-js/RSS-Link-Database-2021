On Tuesday and Wednesday, Oct. 26 and 27, 2021, Sylvan Esso are playing two nights in a row at the Palace Theatre in St. Paul. One year ago, it was quite a different story as touring was not possible for musicians. Ever innovative, Sylvan Esso recorded a performance, specially for The Current, right in their home studio in Durham, N.C., in August 2020. The three-song set includes a track from each of Sylvan Esso's albums to date, starting with a track from 2020's "Free Love" before tracks from their 2014 self-titled release and 2017's "What Now." 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Ferris Wheel"
3:14 "Coffee"
7:39 "Radio"

PERSONNEL
Amelia Meath – vocals
Nick Sanborn – keys, beats

## Courtney Barnett & Kurt Vile - three songs at The Current (2017)

Four years ago, on October 25, 2017, Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile visited The Current for a session in the studio. 

Was it any wonder that Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile became friends? Having shared mutual friends, an overlapping touring schedule and common musical interests, it seemed inevitable. "We started running into each other at shows and festivals and stuff, and we had some mutual Melbourne friends, where I'm from," Barnett said during her and Vile's 2017 session at The Current.

The friends quickly became musical collaborators, and their resulting album, "Lotta Sea Lice," is evidence of their productive cross-pollination. "I've worked with different people in my life," Vile said, "and [Barnett is] the ultimate because I got to make a whole record with her, which I wouldn't have been able to do with others I've played with in the past, because it didn't click in the same way."

Watch three songs performed by Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile during their October 2017 visit to The Current.
