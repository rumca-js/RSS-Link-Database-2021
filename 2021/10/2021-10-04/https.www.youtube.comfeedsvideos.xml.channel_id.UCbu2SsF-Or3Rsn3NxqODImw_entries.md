## Far Cry 6 - Secret Early Alternate Ending

You can beat Far Cry 6 early and get a secret alternate ending at the beginning of the game. Here's how to do it.

To get this ending yourself you'll need to play the opening first island of the game. This does require a few hours of play, so it's not as easy to get as it was in Far Cry 4 and 5. After you destroy the blockade preventing you from leaving, Dani will make their way to Libertad's headquarters.

As promised Clara Garcia will give Dani a boat to sail to America, but also plead with them to stay and help liberate Yara. After the cutscene you'll be left on the dock with the boat. Most players will of course stay and continue the fight against Anton Castillo, but if you do get on the boat and sail towards the edge of the map, you'll trigger the game's alternate ending.

Dani will be lounging on a beach in America while a news report details Anton's victory over Libertad. Getting this ending will net you the trophy/achievement "Hidden In Plain Sight".

With the release of Far Cry 6, we went back to the beginning to chart how Ubisoft's open-world franchise evolved from tech demo to AAA behemoth. 

Far Cry had humble beginnings. It started life as a tech demo made by then-unknown developer Crytek and, over time, managed to become one of Ubisoft's tentpole franchises. 

In this video we chart the history of the franchise, from the 2004 PC hit that laid the groundwork of the franchise, through to Far Cry 2's divisive malaria mechanic, Far Cry 3's outstanding villain, Far Cry 4's traversal, and the politics of Far Cry 5, coming all the way up to 2021's Far Cry 6. Of course, we spend time discussing the infamous Uwe Boll movie, as well as the iconic villains that helped shape the series to what it's known best for today. 

Far Cry 6 launches on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, and Luna on October 7. For more on the game subscribe or head over to GameSpot.com, where you can also learn more about Ubisoft's employees taking action to change to hostile company culture, and how the company itself has responded.

The Metroid franchise has a sprawling timeline that weaves its sci-fi saga across 11 mainline games. But how does everything tie together?

Metroid Dread marks the conclusion of a story arc dating back 35 years, which takes in the original Metroid, Metroid 2: Return of Samus, Super Metroid, and Metroid Fusion. Hence, y’know, Metroid 5. 

But that chronology doesn’t even take into account the Metroid Prime trilogy and its various handheld spin-offs, or even Metroid: Other M. So with Metroid Dread set to expand the canon and conclude Samus’ long-standing mission to exterminate the Metroids, what better time to recap the franchise’s entire story.

The above video breaks down the Metroid franchise's timeline from Samus' iconic confrontation with Mother Brain all the way through to Metroid Fusion and Metroid Dread.

## Alan Wake Remastered vs Original | Graphics Comparison

See how the original Xbox 360 release of Alan Wake stacks up the 2021 remastered version running on PS5.

Remedy Entertainment's beloved game Alan Wake returns on modern systems with Alan Wake Remastered. Originally an Xbox 360 exclusive back in 2010, the game has since seen a PC port and now a proper remaster.

Remastered is the same game but with a host of visual improvements. A major one of note is the reworking of character models and improved facial expressions. You can see a marked improvement in lip sync, and Alan no longer spends half the game with his mouth agape, the silliness of which I never noticed until comparing him side by side with his updated model. Alan might look drastically different to fans in fact--this is due to a new face model being created for this remastered version. However, Alan is still portrayed by finnish actor, Ilkka Villi just like in the original, and if anything he more closely resembles him with the updated model.

This updated look for Alan Wake might have the benefit of bridging the gap to a potential Alan Wake sequel. Remedy has been hinting at a return to Alan Wake for several years now, most recently with the final DLC for Control, which confirms both games share the same universe and even has Alan make several small appearances. The remastered version of Alan Wake has its own secrets that hint at the future of the series, so keep an eye on GameSpot for more details.

## Nintendo Switch's Lack of Wii Sports is a Crime

Wii Sports is as vital to Nintendo's history as Mario, Zelda, and Pokemon, and yet it is criminally absent from the Switch.

Wii Sports is the best-selling console exclusive, and fourth highest selling game of all time just behind Tetris, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Minecraft. It's responsible for putting Nintendo front-and-center in mainstream media, and helping catapult the Wii's sales ahead of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. There is no denying Wii Sports' importance to Nintendo's success, and yet it's been missing for nearly a decade.

With the exception of the haphazard release of Wii Sports Club for the Wii U, Wii Sports' legacy is slipping to the sands of time, which all more offensive when considering all the pieces to give it life are on the Nintendo Switch. 

Join Kurt Indovina, as he traces back Wii Sports' impact on culture, its importance to Nintendo's success, and how the game holds up 15 years later.
