Here's how to do it.\n\nTo get this ending yourself you'll need to play the opening first island of the game. This does require a few hours of play, so it's not as easy to get as it was in Far Cry 4 and 5. After you destroy the blockade preventing you from leaving, Dani will make their way to Libertad's headquarters.\n\nAs promised Clara Garcia will give Dani a boat to sail to America, but also plead with them to stay and help liberate Yara. After the cutscene you'll be left on the dock with the boat. Most players will of course stay and continue the fight against Anton Castillo, but if you do get on the boat and sail towards the edge of the map, you'll trigger the game's alternate ending.\n\nDani will be lounging on a beach in America while a news report details Anton's victory over Libertad. Getting this ending will net you the trophy/achievement \"Hidden In Plain Sight\".", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glxdlLyxKgc", "date_published": "2021-10-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "History Of Far Cry", "description": "With the release of Far Cry 6, we went back to the beginning to chart how Ubisoft's open-world franchise evolved from tech demo to AAA behemoth. \n\nFar Cry had humble beginnings. It started life as a tech demo made by then-unknown developer Crytek and, over time, managed to become one of Ubisoft's tentpole franchises. \n\nIn this video we chart the history of the franchise, from the 2004 PC hit that laid the groundwork of the franchise, through to Far Cry 2's divisive malaria mechanic, Far Cry 3's outstanding villain, Far Cry 4's traversal, and the politics of Far Cry 5, coming all the way up to 2021's Far Cry 6. Of course, we spend time discussing the infamous Uwe Boll movie, as well as the iconic villains that helped shape the series to what it's known best for today. \n\nFar Cry 6 launches on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, and Luna on October 7.

Originally an Xbox 360 exclusive back in 2010, the game has since seen a PC port and now a proper remaster.\n\nRemastered is the same game but with a host of visual improvements. A major one of note is the reworking of character models and improved facial expressions. You can see a marked improvement in lip sync, and Alan no longer spends half the game with his mouth agape, the silliness of which I never noticed until comparing him side by side with his updated model. Alan might look drastically different to fans in fact--this is due to a new face model being created for this remastered version. However, Alan is still portrayed by finnish actor, Ilkka Villi just like in the original, and if anything he more closely resembles him with the updated model.\n\nThis updated look for Alan Wake might have the benefit of bridging the gap to a potential Alan Wake sequel. Remedy has been hinting at a return to Alan Wake for several years now, most recently with the final DLC for Control, which confirms both games share the same universe and even has Alan make several small appearances.
