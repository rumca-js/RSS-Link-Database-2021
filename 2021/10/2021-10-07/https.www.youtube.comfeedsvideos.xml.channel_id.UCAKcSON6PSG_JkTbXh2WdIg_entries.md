Eleven years ago, Minneapolis band Fort Wilson Riot performed a session in The Current studio for The Local Show; a year and change later, they performed at the Sheldon Theatre in Red Wing, Minn., as part of Caravan Du Nord, a statewide concert series presented by the Minnesota Music Coalition and The Current. This Saturday, Oct. 9, Caravan Du Nord returns to the Sheldon Theatre for a show featuring Nur-D, The Immaculate Beings, Clay Fulton and the Lost Forty.
