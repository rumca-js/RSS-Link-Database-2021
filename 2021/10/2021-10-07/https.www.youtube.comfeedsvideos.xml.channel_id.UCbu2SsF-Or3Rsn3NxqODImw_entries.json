Vaas is the guy who pretty much defined what has become the archetypal Far Cry villain. He's charismatic, scary, and ruthless, and he has some long and fun bad guy monologues. Hints that Vaas was returning have circulated for more than a year, with actor Michael Mando even suggesting he'd reprise the role, and that's fueled a lot of fan theories about the villain's role in Far Cry 6. \n\nUbisoft revealed earlier this year that Vaas, as well as Far Cry 4 villain Pagan Min and Far Cry 5 villain Joseph Seed, would be playable characters in a Far Cry 6 post-launch DLC expansion. But as it turns out, there's more to the Vaas story than whatever is going on in that expansion--which seems altogether dream-like and might possibly exist outside the realm of Far Cry 6's \"real world.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4K_cDtUo9U", "date_published": "2021-10-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Far Cry 6 Review", "description": "Though it can be really fun, especially when it descends into absolute chaos, Far Cry 6 is overstuffed and disjointed, with so many ideas that it's tough to focus.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc1LfTizxyo", "date_published": "2021-10-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "15 Best Switch Exclusives To Play Right Now", "description": "Whether you're an existing Switch owner looking to complete your collection, or someone new to the Switch family looking for where to start, look no further: we put together a list of the 15 of the best Switch Exclusives.\n\nTIME STAMPS:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:21 - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\n01:05 - Super Mario Odyssey\n01:50 - Fire Emblem: Three Houses\n02:26 - Luigi's Mansion 3\n03:06 - Super Smash Bros.
