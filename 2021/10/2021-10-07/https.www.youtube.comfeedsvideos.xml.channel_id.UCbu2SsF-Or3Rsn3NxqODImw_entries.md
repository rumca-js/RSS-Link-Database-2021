A post-credits scene in Far Cry 6 answers some questions about the possible return of Far Cry 3 villain Vaas, while raising a few more.

For a while now, fans have speculated that Far Cry 6 would bring back fan-favorite villain Vaas, one of the antagonists of Far Cry 3. Vaas is the guy who pretty much defined what has become the archetypal Far Cry villain. He's charismatic, scary, and ruthless, and he has some long and fun bad guy monologues. Hints that Vaas was returning have circulated for more than a year, with actor Michael Mando even suggesting he'd reprise the role, and that's fueled a lot of fan theories about the villain's role in Far Cry 6. 

Ubisoft revealed earlier this year that Vaas, as well as Far Cry 4 villain Pagan Min and Far Cry 5 villain Joseph Seed, would be playable characters in a Far Cry 6 post-launch DLC expansion. But as it turns out, there's more to the Vaas story than whatever is going on in that expansion--which seems altogether dream-like and might possibly exist outside the realm of Far Cry 6's "real world."

Though it can be really fun, especially when it descends into absolute chaos, Far Cry 6 is overstuffed and disjointed, with so many ideas that it's tough to focus.

n this episode of GameSpot News, we explain why Battlefield’s open beta is months old, why EA might rename the FIFA series and when you can expect to see Halo Infinite ranked gameplay.

In this video, DeVante talks about why the Battlefield 2042 open beta is already facing a variety of bugs and issues just a day after going live. DICE also published a list of known issues with the Battlefield 2042 open beta, some of which have already been fixed for the full game's release in November.

DeVante also explains the reason EA is thinking about renaming their FIFA series of soccer games. This situation is similar, in some ways, to what's happening with EA's college football series which will return without the NCAA title. 

Later on, Halo Infinite’s ranked gameplay is revealed to be coming very soon and NPD credits a rise in game sales on older generations and lapsed gamers.
