She's barefoot and wearing yellow, like the roses on her side table tiny desk, Osh\u00fan's color. On the floor, below the seaside view, is a box of records displaying\u00a0Celia & Johnny, the 1974 classic collaboration between Celia Cruz and Johnny Pacheco. To her right sits the 1979 album\u00a0Cross Over\u00a0by the Fania All Stars, of which Celia and Johnny were both starring members. From Soho Beach House in Miami, YE\u0418DRY performs five songs, which make up most of her solo discography.\n\nShe opens with a song that's just as intimate as her space. \"Nena\" is a prayer sung from the perspective of her mother when she went to Italy in search of opportunity, while a young Yendry Fiorentino stayed with her grandmother in her hometown of Santo Domingo. After she turned 4, she joined her mother in Turin, where she grew up and started her music career.\n\nYE\u0418DRY's songs radiate with a feminine strength of many lives lived, from the sobered reflection on a past relationship of \"Se Acab\u00f3\" to the self-sure \"Ya,\" a song \"about the fire ... and the courage that all of us have inside. And sometimes we struggle to get it out.\" Its first phrase, \"yo quiero to'\" (\"I want it all\"), is an invocation of remembering who you are. In \"You,\" her collaboration with\u00a0Damian Marley, she inhabits the voices of both lovers with a seamless confidence. And in her closer, \"El Diablo,\" she adopts even the devil's power with a slow-burning flamenco that ignites into merengue as she repeats \"soy Dominicana / soy Italiana,\" honoring all her selves in the afternoon light.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Nena\"\n \u2022 \"Se Acab\u00f3\"\n \u2022 \"YA\"\n \u2022 \"YOU\"\n \u2022 \"El Diablo\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 YE\u0418DRY: vocals\n \u2022 Danny Flores: keys\n \u2022 Jevenson Americain: bass\n \u2022 Anderson Quintero: drum pad\n \u2022 Daniel Berroa Sr.: percussion\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Eliam Coro, Seba Creative, Richard Quintero\n \u2022 Audio: Danny Flores, Jes\u00fas Cantun\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Anamaria Sayre\n \u2022 Video Producer: Kara Frame\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Alt.Latino 'El Tiny' Team: Felix Contreras, Reanna Cruz, Ana\u00efs Laurent, Stefanie Fernandez\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Maia Stern, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#eltiny #tinydesk #yendry #eltiny", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_a5zbizXCw", "date_published": "2021-10-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
