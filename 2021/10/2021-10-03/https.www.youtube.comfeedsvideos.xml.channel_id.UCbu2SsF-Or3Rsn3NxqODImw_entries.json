Originally an Xbox 360 exclusive back in 2010, the game has since seen a PC port and now a proper remaster.\n\nRemastered is the same game but with a host of visual improvements. A major one of note is the reworking of character models and improved facial expressions. You can see a marked improvement in lip sync, and Alan no longer spends half the game with his mouth agape, the silliness of which I never noticed until comparing him side by side with his updated model. Alan might look drastically different to fans in fact--this is due to a new face model being created for this remastered version. However, Alan is still portrayed by finnish actor, Ilkka Villi just like in the original, and if anything he more closely resembles him with the updated model.\n\nThis updated look for Alan Wake might have the benefit of bridging the gap to a potential Alan Wake sequel. Remedy has been hinting at a return to Alan Wake for several years now, most recently with the final DLC for Control, which confirms both games share the same universe and even has Alan make several small appearances. The remastered version of Alan Wake has its own secrets that hint at the future of the series, so keep an eye on GameSpot for more details.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVkUnJ7U-YI", "date_published": "2021-10-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Far Cry 6 - 12 Minutes of Boat Stealth and Shootout Gameplay", "description": "See some early story mission gameplay of Far Cry 6 featuring some stealth infiltration before everything turns into a full blown shootout.

The game follows Samus Aran, the best space hunter in the galaxy, on her mission to defeat the Metroid and destroy the Mother Brain. Metroid\u2019s unique design has gone on to inspire the Metroidvania genre as seen in games like Hollow Knight and Axiom Verge, and it\u2019s also among the first games to feature a female protagonist, so it\u2019s definitely an important one in the history of video games.\n\nBut how is the original Metroid in 2021? Should you go back to it in the leadup to Metroid Dread? Hopefully this video will help answer that question, and the answer might not be what you think it is. Regardless, the original NES Metroid is currently available through Nintendo Switch Online making it easy to try out if you\u2019re interested in doing so.\n\nSomething even I didn\u2019t realize before Dread\u2019s announcement is that each of the 2D Metroid games is a numbered entry and one continuous story. There\u2019s the original NES Metroid and it\u2019s remake Zero Mission, Metroid II: Return of Samus and it\u2019s remake Samus Returns, Super Metroid which is Metroid 3, and Metroid Fusion which is Metroid 4. Unfortunately if you want to play Metroid 2 & 4 you\u2019ll need to own a Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. I always knew owning a Wii U would be cool one day.\n\nMetroid NES Map: https://nesmaps.com/maps/Metroid/MetroidCompleteMapBG.html\n\nMetroid Instruction Booklet: https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAAQE.pdf\n\nChalk Font: https://www.dafont.com/chalk.font\n\nRevisiting The Original No More Heroes: https://youtu.be/wSVXloMQXGY\n\nMore Metroid videos:\nThe Complete Metroid Timeline Explained: https://youtu.be/SrCFB-jxPVg\nThe Metroid Franchise - Which Are Worth Playing/Buying?: https://youtu.be/04aibjsKiXo\nMetroid Dread's Tension Is Relentless | Hands-On Preview: https://youtu.be/Gy9LZ2sSnHM\nMetroid Dread - 5 Minutes of Off-Screen Gameplay: https://youtu.be/HzrGWR4cgt0\nMetroid Dread Review: https://youtu.be/mYFZwzo7qlQ", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FCtAdnjK7M", "date_published": "2021-10-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
