The scene: the light-soaked Biblioteca de la Autoridad del Canal de Panam\u00e1 Roberto F. Chiari.\nSech arrives with a book he places on the table. His blazer bears his name, the isthmus of Panama and its flag, and the likeness of Panamanian Yankee great Mariano Rivera and his jersey number, 42 (the namesake of Sech's most recent album). He approaches the mic for a silky version of \"Playa\" that, like the rest of his Tiny Desk set, is nearly entirely acoustic.\n\nSech's discography is itself a place of learning for the Latin pop industry he has reinvigorated. The history of reggaet\u00f3n often dwells disproportionately on Puerto Rico in the 1990s, overshadowing its\u00a0creation\u00a0by Black Panamanians in the 1980s with plena and reggae en espa\u00f1ol, born from Jamaican reggae and dancehall and iterated in R\u00edo Abajo, Sech's hometown in Panama City. \"Otro Trago\" introduced Sech's honeyed, melodic vocal range as a promising young player in an industry enamored with its own reductive powers. In Sech's hands, reggaet\u00f3n is given the care of a people's history.\n\nMusic fills every corner of the library, from the violin-DJ-bass trio nested in the second-floor balcony, to the background vocals, keys and drums (anchoring the whole thing in lush, acoustic dembow), to Sech and his guitarist and producer Jhon el Divertido in the forefront. The sterile fluorescents among the stacks shift to disco lighting for the bitter ex-text \"911,\" which eventually melts into an a cappella chorus. It ends on a melancholy violin riff that blooms seamlessly into the jazzy opening of \"Sal y Perrea.\" Sech might be singing about stalking an ex's social media or pointing a newly single woman toward tequila to forget some payaso, but his modern textbook feels timeless in this hybrid arrangement, showing \u2014 as well as telling \u2014 the story of dembow and its power to heal.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Playa\"\n \u2022 \"911\"\n \u2022 \"Sal y Perrea\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Sech: vocals\n \u2022 Michael Ward: DJ\n \u2022 Abdiel Morales: drums\n \u2022 Rasta Lloyd: bass\n \u2022 Jhonattan Reyes: guitar\n \u2022 Omar Perez: vocals\n \u2022 Anabel De Jesus: vocals\n \u2022 Marie Camille Alerte: vocals\n \u2022 Florlenz Alerte: vocals\n \u2022 Julio Montes: vocals\n \u2022 Joshue Ashby: violin\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Moises Morales, Andr\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez\n \u2022 Audio: Guillermo \"Memo\" Bailey, Ram\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez, Eduardo \"Cerebro\" Fernandez\n \u2022 Gaffer: Guillermo Yanguez\n \u2022 Grip: Eric Gonz\u00e1lez\n \u2022 Assistant Camera: Antonio Zaenz, Abdiel Gonz\u00e1lez\n \u2022 Backline: Ricardo \"Yoshi\" Castillo\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Anamaria Sayre\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Alt.Latino 'El Tiny' Team: Felix Contreras, Reanna Cruz, Ana\u00efs Laurent, Stefanie Fernandez\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Bobby Carter, Kara Frame, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #eltiny #sech", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdHPotMqv1M", "date_published": "2021-10-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Jhay Cortez + Buscabulla: Una Conversaci\u00f3n Con Alt.Latino", "description": "We kicked off our Hispanic Heritage Month live interviews with a joint interview between reggaet\u00f3n artist Jhay Cortez and electronic duo Buscabulla.
