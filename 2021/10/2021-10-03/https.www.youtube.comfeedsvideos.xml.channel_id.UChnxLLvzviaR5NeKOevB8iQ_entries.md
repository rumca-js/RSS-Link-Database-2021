Ephemere by Patching Panda is a dual-channel CV and Audio recorder, looper, slicer, and remixer. It can record CV, play it back at different speeds, slice it, scan through it, and much more. At higher sample rates it can do the same for audio. It's wild. In this video, we'll walk through how it works and have some jams!
