We all know you need oxygen to live. But why? What happens to oxygen in our bodies? Why does it keep us alive? And maybe most importantly, why does it slowly kill us?

In today's video, I explore the process of respiration, how it's weirdly similar to fire, and why we rely on one of the most corrosive elements in the universe to survive. It gets weirdly existential.
