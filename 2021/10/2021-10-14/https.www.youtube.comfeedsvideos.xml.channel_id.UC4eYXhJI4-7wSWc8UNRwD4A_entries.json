As the final performance in our Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration, her El Tiny concert epitomises the cross-cultural, transnational musical identities we've centered over the course of the series. Each unique arrangement of her universal hits represents and explores a new facet of the identities and experiences that make up Cabello.\n\nThese stripped-down renditions of her hits \"Havana,\" \"Real Friends,\" \"Se\u00f1orita\" and \"Don't Go Yet\" include more Latin instrumentation than the recordings \u2014 presumably bringing them closer to sounds that were first introduced to her as music during her childhood in Havana, Mexico City, and Miami.\n\nThe interlude featuring a sacred Afro-Cuban Santer\u00eda chant and the following performance of the unreleased, Mariachi-based \"La Buena Vida,\" firmly root Cabello's El Tiny performance within two cultural traditions that don't typically glitter under the harsh lights of a global stage.\n\nHere, we find Camila on the precipice of a voice that magically layers pop with tradition, holding all parts of a complex identity in seamless harmony. Flanked by Cuban congueros and Mexican mariachi, all aglow under the Miami sun, Camila Cabello's heart has never felt more whole.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\"Havana\"\n\"Real Friends\"\n\"Se\u00f1orita\"\n\"Don't Go Yet\"\n\"La Buena Vida\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCamila Cabello: vocals\nEdwin Carranza: bass/music director\nMarcus Kincy: keys/glockenspiel\nChris Johnson: drums\nLuke Iono: guitar\nYisel Duque: vocals\nJackie Mendez: vocals\nAlex Garcia: guitar\nCamilo Velandia: guitar\nDaniel Lopez: percussion\nJoel del Sol: percussion\nGerardo Rodriguez: trumpet\nMayerlin Carrero: trombone\nLuisi \"Rosca\" Beltran: saxophone\nCheche Alara: accordion, rhodes\nJimmy K.
