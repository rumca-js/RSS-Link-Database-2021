I own a regular PinePhone, and while it's a great device to try out, and develop for mobile versions of Linux, I always felt the hardware couldn't really carry that phone into a daily driver state for me. It seems like The Pine 64 have decided to offer a more premium device this time around, so let's see what it will look like!\n\n#PinePhone #PinePhonePro #LinuxPhone\n\n\ud83d\udc4f SUPPORT THE CHANNEL:\nGet access to an exclusive weekly podcast, vote on the next topics I cover, and get your name in the credits:\n\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5UAwBUum7CPN5buc-_N1Fw/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thelinuxexperiment\n\nOr, you can donate whatever you want: https://paypal.me/thelinuxexp?locale.x=fr_FR\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 FOLLOW ME ELSEWHERE:\nJoin us on our new Discord server: https://discord.gg/xK7ukavWmQ\nTwitter : http://twitter.com/thelinuxEXP\nMy Gaming on Linux Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaw_Lz7oifDb-PZCAcZ07kw\nFollow me on ODYSEE: https://odysee.com/@TheLinuxExperiment:e\nOr join ODYSEE: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@TheLinuxExperiment:e\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 GEAR I USE:\nSony Alpha A6600 Mirrorless Camera: https://amzn.to/30zKyn7\nSigma 56mm Fixed Prime Lens: https://amzn.to/3aRvK5l\nLogitech MX Master 3 Mouse: https://amzn.to/3BVI0Od\nBluetooth Space Grey Mac Keyboard: https://amzn.to/3jcJETZ\nLogitech Brio 4K Webcam: https://amzn.to/3jgeTh9\nLG Curved Ultrawide Monitor: https://amzn.to/3pcTVDH\nLogitech White Speakers: https://amzn.to/3n6wSb0\nXbox Controller: https://amzn.to/3BWmIA3\n*Amazon Links are affiliate codes and generate small commissions to support the channel*\n\n00:00 Intro\n\n00:52 The Device\n03:40 Who is it for?\n04:56 The Strategy\n\nIt sports a Rockchip system on a chip, with 6 cores running at 1.5Ghz, paired with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, and 128GB of internal eMMC storage. That SoC seems to be a variant of the RK 3399, fine-tuned to have as good thermals as possible, and better battery life. They also managed to enable suspend state, so your phone will still be able to receive calls and messages without using too much battery life.\n\nCompare this to the regular PinePhone, which only sported a Quad-Core Allwinner SoC running at 1.152 GHz, with up to 3GB LPDDR3 RAM, although my model only had 2 Gigs. It should be a major improvement, and have performance levels comparable to a mid range current Android smartphone.\n\nAs a matter of fact, The Pine 64 says it should be about 20% slower than a PineBook PRO, which is a very capable ARM laptop. That should make our Linux mobile desktops run really well on this thing.\n\nCameras have been vastly improved as well, with a 13MP main shooter in the back, and a 5MP front facing camera.\n\nThe regular pinephone had a 5MP main camera and a 2MP front facing one, so there should be a very visible upgrade in terms of image quality. megapixels aren't everything, but you need to have a healthy amount of them to at least pretend to take a decent picture.\n\nThe body of the phone seems very close to the original, to the point that the Pro supports all accessories made for the baseline pinephone, including back attachments, the keyboard and the wireless charging case. The only things that won't fit are the covers.\n\nYou still get the same hardware killswitches under the case to disable the mic, Wifi and bluetooth, headphone jack and the modem. \n\nThe display uses a 1440x720p resolution, the same as the original pinephone. It's an IPS display though, it's covered by Gorilla Glass 4, and has an elevated bezel to protect the screen from scratches when lying on a flat surface or falling.\n\nIt does make the chassis 2mm thicker though. The back plate has also been modified to be less prone to fingerprints, which is a good thing, as the original one could quickly turn into a nightmare for neatfreaks like me.\n\nThe battery is the same as the PinePhone, a Samsung J7 compatible one, at 3000mAh. This might be an issue, as the new SoC is more powerful and thus might use more power. We'll have to see if the optimizations they've worked on with the manufacturer can offset that.\n\nThe PinePhone Pro is available for preorder already, at a 399$ price, and people opting to buy one should expect it to arrive in early 2022, unless component shortages intensify. \n\nOf course, this thing isn't a silver bullet for Linux phones. Software still has a ways to go to be daily driver material for me, and probably for a lot of people as well.\n\nSo the PinePhone PRO is still geared towards developers, and super early enthusiasts who want a phone that can also be their Linux desktop when they need it to, but who don't rely on apps too much.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ar8JdKj5Yv8", "date_published": "2021-10-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC5UAwBUum7CPN5buc-_N1Fw", "title": "Ubuntu 21.10 Review - A risk-free transition release (+flavors)", "description": "Skip the hassle of Database Maintenance with DataBaseCare: https://bit.ly/3aBpa2y\n\n\nUbuntu 21.10 has been released. It's an interesting one, not because it adds many features that you've never seen before, but because it's a transition release. It introduces a bunch of new systems, that, while not enabled by default, will probably be in the next LTS.

It moves to GNOME 40 with its horizontal workspaces.\nThe layout isn't standard, as Ubuntu kept its dock on the left hand side of the screen. When opening the activities view, you'll still see the dock, as well as the workspaces switcher, and all your currently open desktops.\n\nOn the Show applications button, you see a grid of your apps, no more \"recent\" or \"all\" tabs, and the workspace switcher on which you can drag and drop app icons to open them.\n\nUbuntu 21.10 doesn't land you on the Activities view after a clean boot, though, you'll still be dropped on the desktop itself.\n\nThe Ubuntu Dock also sees a few changes this time around, picking up a few features that were left to desktop icons before.\n\nThe trashcan is now pinned to the dock, separated from your apps by a divider. Running apps that aren't pinned will also appear behind this divided so you can more clearly tell what's pinned and what's not.\n\nRemoveable devices will also appear in the dock instead of on the desktop itself.\n\nVisually, Ubuntu drops the mixed dark and light theme option.\n\nAs always, Ubuntu ships a mix of GNOME 40 an GNOME 41 applications. And also 3.38 apps, like the terminal or the Cheese webcam app.\n\nThe System Monitor app is moved to its 41 version, for example, just like the Calendar, which gains support for importing .ics event and can FINALLY be set as the default calendar app. \n\nNautilus, now has the ability to show a \"creation date\" column in the list view, by right clicking on the column header, and this column can be used to sort the files. It can also autocomplete when you're typing a path in the URL bar.\n\nYou will also be able to extract password protected archives directly, and you'll have the ability to choose whether to run or edit a script file, in the right click menu: you now get to choose if you want to run a file, and it will open in a terminal so you can look at the output.\n\nGNOME Software isn't its nicely redesigned self, unfortunately.\n\nThe most important change here, though, will be the one that most regular users won't notice at all.\nFirefox is now shipped as a SNAP package. And when I say that most users won't notice, i'm lying, because it is extremely SLOW to open. Like, almost 10 seconds slow, on its first start.\n\nYou'll also get the usual updates to LibreOffice, which now sports the new command Hub to search through functions, a very useful feature.\n\nNow let's talk about the installer.\n\nIt hasn't changed a bit. That's right, the new installer isn't finished yet, which means that for now, you'll still get to use the old one, which is slow and looks very dated.\n\nThe new installer can be tested using special \"Canary\" daily builds. It's... disappointing. It basically looks exactly like the previous installer in terms of how it runs, and how it's presented.\nYou get to pick your language, keyboard layout, then choose between the complete or minimal install.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXfpbsCXUmE", "date_published": "2021-10-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
