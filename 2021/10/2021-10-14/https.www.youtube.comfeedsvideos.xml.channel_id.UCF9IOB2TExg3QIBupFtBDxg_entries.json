Nicolai, Cardiology Fellow, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich:\n\nGerman Centre for Cardiovascular Research\n\nIndeed, there is peer-reviewed work showing in mice that possibly intravenous injection of mRNA vaccine leads to myocardial inflammation. \n\nthat intravenous injection of adenoviral vector based vaccine (AZ1222, ChAdOx1) leads to thrombocytopenia and platelet-directed immune responses,\n \noffering a possible explanation for vaccine-induced thrombosis/thrombocytopenia\n\nthese data might indicate a simple measure to lower the incidence of vaccine-induced side effects, \n\nThere is a lack of data on frequency and effects of IV injection in humans. \n\nMost likely, two approaches are needed to further validate the data: \n\nLarge animal studies\n\nStudies comparing incidence of vaccine-associated thrombosis/thrombocytopenia/ myocarditis in countries with mandated syringe aspiration to countries that don\u2019t mandate this practice.\n\nThrombocytopenia and splenic platelet directed immune responses after intravenous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration (29th June 2021)\n\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.29.450356v1\n\nRecently a rare and novel complication of SARS-CoV-2 targeted adenovirus vaccines has emerged: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). \n\nwe employ in vitro and in vivo models\n\nto characterize the possible mechanisms of this platelet-targeted autoimmunity. \n\nWe show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation. \n\nAfter intravenous injection, these aggregates are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen and platelet remnants are found in the spleen.\n\nThis is followed by a pronounced B-cell response with the emergence of circulating antibodies binding to platelets.\n\nOur work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS. \n\nHence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, \n\ncould be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.\n\nHelen Petousis-Harris, Associate Professor, University of Auckland:\n\nVaccinologist and associate professor at the University of Auckland\n\nThere are a range of injection techniques for administering vaccines, \n\nInjecting fast and withdrawing the needle\n\nInjecting slowly before withdrawing\n\nPulling back on the plunger, seeing there is no blood, then injecting. This is called aspiration.\n\nRationale for aspirating\n\nvaccine could be inadvertently delivered into the blood rather than the muscle tissue. \n\nBut as the flashback of blood hardly ever happens, the practice was abandoned by many practitioners. \n\nI have not seen any evidence to support the rejection of this hypothesis at this stage. \n\nThe animal model study supports the possibility that inadvertent injection into a blood vessel could result in undesirable reactions. \n\nHowever, the majority of myocarditis cases are occurring in young males after the second dose, something that this hypothesis does not explain.\n\nMy conclusion is that this requires more research and observing the patterns of post-vaccine myocarditis among populations where aspiration is practiced could be helpful.\n\nCommon sense in Denmark\n\nhttps://en.ssi.dk/news/epi-news/2021/no-19-21---2021\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Janssen\n\nA single 0.5 mL dose of undiluted vaccine is given.\n\nBased on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before injection.\n\nDownload John's two comprehensive but free educational text books or make a donation to the campbellteaching project using this link: http://159.69.48.3", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXcddiS32s0", "date_published": "2021-10-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
