Hello! Today we get an awesome hands on look at the new HTC Vive Flow, a tiny VR headset that is SO light... both in weight and in some features. I did however have a really great time using the headset/ glasses and I see some amazing use cases for the device, it just needs some refinement and I can't wait to see more headsets in this form factor.
