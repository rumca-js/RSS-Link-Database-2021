Born Oct. 13, 1941, in Newark, N.J., the singer-songwriter turns 80 today. Simon found much success as half of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, formed in 1956 with childhood pal Art Garfunkel, but he ventured out on his own in 1970 and would go on to find decades of more success as a solo artist. Simon has earned 16 Grammy awards for his solo and collaborative work, including three for Album of the Year (\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" and \"Graceland\"), and a Lifetime Achievement Award. He is a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 first in 1990 as a member of Simon & Garfunkel and again in 2001 for his solo career.\n\nIn November 2019, Paul Simon performed on an episode of Live From Here, recorded live at the Town Hall in New York City. Watch three performances from that program.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Questions For The Angels\"\n4:42 \"American Tune\"\n8:54 \"Kodachrome\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nPaul Simon \u2013 vocals, guitar\nChris Thile \u2013 mandolin, vocals\nAna\u00efs Mitchell \u2013 vocals\nMike Elizondo \u2013 bass\nAlex Hargreaves \u2013 fiddle\nArmand Hirsch \u2013 guitar\nJon Cowherd \u2013 keys\nEric Doob \u2013 percussion\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Ben Miller; American Public Media\nAudio: Sam Hudson; American Public Media\nProduction: Jeffy Hnilicka; Tom Campbell; American Public Media\n\nFIND MORE:\n2021 Today in Music History: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2021/10/13/today-in-music-history-happy-birthday-paul-simon\n2018 Rock and Roll Book Club: Robert Hilburn's 'Paul Simon: The Life': https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/05/29/paul-simon-life-robert-hilburn\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#paulsimon", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoqHeJwcITM", "date_published": "2021-10-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
