The PinePhone PRO was just announced! I own a regular PinePhone, and while it's a great device to try out, and develop for mobile versions of Linux, I always felt the hardware couldn't really carry that phone into a daily driver state for me. It seems like The Pine 64 have decided to offer a more premium device this time around, so let's see what it will look like!

00:00 Intro

00:52 The Device
03:40 Who is it for?
04:56 The Strategy

It sports a Rockchip system on a chip, with 6 cores running at 1.5Ghz, paired with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, and 128GB of internal eMMC storage. That SoC seems to be a variant of the RK 3399, fine-tuned to have as good thermals as possible, and better battery life. They also managed to enable suspend state, so your phone will still be able to receive calls and messages without using too much battery life.

Compare this to the regular PinePhone, which only sported a Quad-Core Allwinner SoC running at 1.152 GHz, with up to 3GB LPDDR3 RAM, although my model only had 2 Gigs. It should be a major improvement, and have performance levels comparable to a mid range current Android smartphone.

As a matter of fact, The Pine 64 says it should be about 20% slower than a PineBook PRO, which is a very capable ARM laptop. That should make our Linux mobile desktops run really well on this thing.

Cameras have been vastly improved as well, with a 13MP main shooter in the back, and a 5MP front facing camera.

The regular pinephone had a 5MP main camera and a 2MP front facing one, so there should be a very visible upgrade in terms of image quality. megapixels aren't everything, but you need to have a healthy amount of them to at least pretend to take a decent picture.

The body of the phone seems very close to the original, to the point that the Pro supports all accessories made for the baseline pinephone, including back attachments, the keyboard and the wireless charging case. The only things that won't fit are the covers.

You still get the same hardware killswitches under the case to disable the mic, Wifi and bluetooth, headphone jack and the modem. 

The display uses a 1440x720p resolution, the same as the original pinephone. It's an IPS display though, it's covered by Gorilla Glass 4, and has an elevated bezel to protect the screen from scratches when lying on a flat surface or falling.

It does make the chassis 2mm thicker though. The back plate has also been modified to be less prone to fingerprints, which is a good thing, as the original one could quickly turn into a nightmare for neatfreaks like me.

The battery is the same as the PinePhone, a Samsung J7 compatible one, at 3000mAh. This might be an issue, as the new SoC is more powerful and thus might use more power. We'll have to see if the optimizations they've worked on with the manufacturer can offset that.

The PinePhone Pro is available for preorder already, at a 399$ price, and people opting to buy one should expect it to arrive in early 2022, unless component shortages intensify. 

Of course, this thing isn't a silver bullet for Linux phones. Software still has a ways to go to be daily driver material for me, and probably for a lot of people as well.

So the PinePhone PRO is still geared towards developers, and super early enthusiasts who want a phone that can also be their Linux desktop when they need it to, but who don't rely on apps too much.

Ubuntu 21.10 has been released. It's an interesting one, not because it adds many features that you've never seen before, but because it's a transition release. It introduces a bunch of new systems, that, while not enabled by default, will probably be in the next LTS. Let's take a tour of what you can expect in this new release.

#Ubuntu #Impish #21.10


00:00 Intro
01:29 The Desktop
04:18 Applications
06:26 Installer
07:47 Flavors
09:13 Good or not?



Ubuntu 21.10 is codenamed Impish Idri. It moves to GNOME 40 with its horizontal workspaces.
The layout isn't standard, as Ubuntu kept its dock on the left hand side of the screen. When opening the activities view, you'll still see the dock, as well as the workspaces switcher, and all your currently open desktops.

On the Show applications button, you see a grid of your apps, no more "recent" or "all" tabs, and the workspace switcher on which you can drag and drop app icons to open them.

Ubuntu 21.10 doesn't land you on the Activities view after a clean boot, though, you'll still be dropped on the desktop itself.

The Ubuntu Dock also sees a few changes this time around, picking up a few features that were left to desktop icons before.

The trashcan is now pinned to the dock, separated from your apps by a divider. Running apps that aren't pinned will also appear behind this divided so you can more clearly tell what's pinned and what's not.

Removeable devices will also appear in the dock instead of on the desktop itself.

Visually, Ubuntu drops the mixed dark and light theme option.

As always, Ubuntu ships a mix of GNOME 40 an GNOME 41 applications. And also 3.38 apps, like the terminal or the Cheese webcam app.

The System Monitor app is moved to its 41 version, for example, just like the Calendar, which gains support for importing .ics event and can FINALLY be set as the default calendar app. 

Nautilus, now has the ability to show a "creation date" column in the list view, by right clicking on the column header, and this column can be used to sort the files. It can also autocomplete when you're typing a path in the URL bar.

You will also be able to extract password protected archives directly, and you'll have the ability to choose whether to run or edit a script file, in the right click menu: you now get to choose if you want to run a file, and it will open in a terminal so you can look at the output.

GNOME Software isn't its nicely redesigned self, unfortunately.

The most important change here, though, will be the one that most regular users won't notice at all.
Firefox is now shipped as a SNAP package. And when I say that most users won't notice, i'm lying, because it is extremely SLOW to open. Like, almost 10 seconds slow, on its first start.

You'll also get the usual updates to LibreOffice, which now sports the new command Hub to search through functions, a very useful feature.

Now let's talk about the installer.

It hasn't changed a bit. That's right, the new installer isn't finished yet, which means that for now, you'll still get to use the old one, which is slow and looks very dated.

The new installer can be tested using special "Canary" daily builds. It's... disappointing. It basically looks exactly like the previous installer in terms of how it runs, and how it's presented.
You get to pick your language, keyboard layout, then choose between the complete or minimal install.
