The Glare assists with finding dark areas, the Allay collects items for you, and the Copper Golem loves to press copper buttons and can turn into a statue over time. You can vote on your favorite mob during Minecraft Live on Saturday, October 16th.\u00a0\n\nEA and DICE have now formally announced Battlefield 2042's Hazard Zone mode where you play in a four-member squad and your objective is to locate and retrieve data drives that have fallen from satellites. You and your team will have a choice of a mid-game or late-game extraction point where the rewards are greater if you stick around but more dangerous as only two squads can leave victorious. Hazard Zone supports 24 players on PS4 and Xbox One and 32 players on PS5/Xbox Series X|S and PC.\n\nThe settings for Halo Infinite\u2019s competitive playlists were showcased during a livestream from 343 developers and include BR start, no motion tracker, friendly fire enabled, and more. Weapons, equipment, and grenades on maps will always appear in the same location on each map and mode combination and will respawn at the same intervals.\u00a0\n\nFor more information on all of our topics today, please visit gamespot.com.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\nIntro - 00:00\nMinecraft - 00:17\nBattlefield 2042 - 02:14\nHalo Infinite - 04:13\nOutro - 05:43", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUVj92ti1U4", "date_published": "2021-10-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Animal Crossing: New Horizons Direct 10.15.2021 Full Presentation", "description": "Check out the full presentation for Animal Crossing: New Horizons where Nintendo showed off details in the free November Update as well as an all new DLC. \n\nThe new DLC Happy Home Paradise will be a paid DLC and brings lots of new features to the game!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlcpZX1T7W4", "date_published": "2021-10-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Animal Crossing: New Horizons Happy Home Paradise DLC Full Presentation", "description": "Check out the full presentation for the all new paid DLC coming to Animal Crossing: New Horizons called Happy Home Paradise!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQyU6PEAaGI", "date_published": "2021-10-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Battlefield 2042 Beta - The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly", "description": "Battlefield 2042 finally gave players a crack at it's open beta and the conversation has been mixed. There's a lot of good, a lot of bad, and some real ugly parts that we decided to break down to see how the Open Beta actually went, and if Battlefield maybe even needs another delay? \n\nBattlefield 2042 wrapped up its open beta to mixed results. There were a lot of positives to the all-out warfare Conquest mode, which players from all over the world got a chance to sink their teeth into, but unfortunately, there were also issues. From bugs and visual glitches to poor performance optimization across multiple platforms, the 2042 beta definitely had its share of problems.\n\nIn this video, we break down some of the most important factors of just where the beta shined, and where it suggests that the full game will seriously need another look. Key components like the excellent destruction are addressed, as well as a look at some of the newest gameplay additions such as the vehicle call-in system and \u201cplus\u201d attachment system.\n\nYour mileage may vary with how you felt on each of these components so definitely let us know in the comments which parts of the beta you enjoyed or didn't quite feel were up to your expectations.

It involves squads landing on a map, hunting down Data Drives, and extracting. \n\nBattlefield 2042 will release on November 19 and will most notably not include a battle royale mode at launch. Instead developer DICE is focusing on a new competitive squad-based game type called Hazard Zone that focuses on multiple four person squads moving around a map and competing to collect Data Drives and get them to extraction points. As opposed to much larger player counts in popular battle royale titles, this game type will have 24 players (six total teams) on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and 32 players (eight total teams) on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.\u00a0\n\nHazard Zone does seem to draw plenty of elements from battle royale titles, such as the ability to spawn downed teammates back at Reinforcement Uplink points or using a Tactical Upgrade. Hazard Zone will be playable on all launch maps from All-Out-Warfare and will occasionally incorporate extreme weather such as tornadoes. Another large element to Hazard Zone will be squad makeup. Players can't use more than one of the same Specialist on their team encouraging teams to work together and rely on different Specialists throughout each match. Having mobility with an operator like Sundance might provide a key advantage during a different phase of the match in comparison to Falck's healing, for example. There is a ton more to know about Hazard Zone, including phases, currencies, tactical upgrades, and how to maximize points.
