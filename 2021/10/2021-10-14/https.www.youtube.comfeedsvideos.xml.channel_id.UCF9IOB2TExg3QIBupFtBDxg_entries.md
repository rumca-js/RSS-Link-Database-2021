Moderna boosters, recommended by FDA independent advisory panel

65 and older and for adults who are at high risk of severe illness

Six months

Half dose

Six to eight months after vaccination, antibody levels dropped in vaccine recipients. 

A half-dose booster at least six months after initial vaccination restored antibodies levels

Week ending 9 October 2021 

People that that had COVID-19 in the week 

Up in England, Wales and NI

Down in Scotland

1.63% in England (1 in 60 people)

2.18% in Wales (1 in 45 people)

0.82% in Northern Ireland (1 in 120 people)

1.26% in Scotland (1 in 80 people)

People testing positive for antibodies

93.6%

Mortality displacement did not offset excess deaths by mid-2021 

Some evidence of mortality displacement during the pandemic

Mortality displacement, when vulnerable people die sooner than expected

Potentially leading to a lower-than-average period of mortality 

These periods of below average mortality did not offset the high number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic

3 January 2020 to 2 July 2021

97,981 excess deaths in England and Wales

(compared to what we would expect in a non-pandemic period). 

Within 28 days of a positive test, 138,379

Certificated, 161,798

Long covid

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights#cis

Long covid as of 5 September 2021

An estimated 1.1 million in the UK experiencing long COVID

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights#cis

1.7% of the total population were experiencing self-reported long COVID

Up from 970,000 (1.5%) at 1 August 2021

831,000 (77%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least 12 weeks previously

405,000 (37%) first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least one year previously

Symptoms adversely affected the day-to-day activities of around two-thirds (65%) of those with self-reported long COVID

Fatigue (56%)

Shortness of breath (40%)

Loss of smell (32%)

Difficulty concentrating (31%)

Professor Tim Spector

The UK seems to be slowly waking up to the fact that COVID cases are too high, 

but the reality is they’ve been soaring for months and many countries have put us on their red list. 

Infections remain high in young people, and look to be spilling over into the 35-55 year olds. 

If these increases creep into the over 55s it could spell disaster for the NHS this winter. 

Herd immunity

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJHdFOwZjVI

Minimum 85%

With cases so high, it’s clear that herd immunity isn't happening

Current symptoms in vaccinated and children

Runny nose, 76%

Headache, 75%

Sneezing, 66%

Sore throat, 53%

Cough 53%

Loss of smell or taste

Intravenous Injection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccine Can Induce Acute Myopericarditis in Mouse Model

Indeed, there is peer-reviewed work showing in mice that possibly intravenous injection of mRNA vaccine leads to myocardial inflammation. 

that intravenous injection of adenoviral vector based vaccine (AZ1222, ChAdOx1) leads to thrombocytopenia and platelet-directed immune responses,
 
offering a possible explanation for vaccine-induced thrombosis/thrombocytopenia

these data might indicate a simple measure to lower the incidence of vaccine-induced side effects, 

There is a lack of data on frequency and effects of IV injection in humans. 

Most likely, two approaches are needed to further validate the data: 

Large animal studies

Studies comparing incidence of vaccine-associated thrombosis/thrombocytopenia/ myocarditis in countries with mandated syringe aspiration to countries that don’t mandate this practice.

Thrombocytopenia and splenic platelet directed immune responses after intravenous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration (29th June 2021)

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.29.450356v1

Recently a rare and novel complication of SARS-CoV-2 targeted adenovirus vaccines has emerged: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). 

we employ in vitro and in vivo models

to characterize the possible mechanisms of this platelet-targeted autoimmunity. 

We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation. 

After intravenous injection, these aggregates are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen and platelet remnants are found in the spleen.

This is followed by a pronounced B-cell response with the emergence of circulating antibodies binding to platelets.

Our work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS. 

Hence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, 

could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.

Helen Petousis-Harris, Associate Professor, University of Auckland:

Vaccinologist and associate professor at the University of Auckland

There are a range of injection techniques for administering vaccines, 

Injecting fast and withdrawing the needle

Injecting slowly before withdrawing

Pulling back on the plunger, seeing there is no blood, then injecting. This is called aspiration.

Rationale for aspirating

vaccine could be inadvertently delivered into the blood rather than the muscle tissue. 

But as the flashback of blood hardly ever happens, the practice was abandoned by many practitioners. 

I have not seen any evidence to support the rejection of this hypothesis at this stage. 

The animal model study supports the possibility that inadvertent injection into a blood vessel could result in undesirable reactions. 

However, the majority of myocarditis cases are occurring in young males after the second dose, something that this hypothesis does not explain.

My conclusion is that this requires more research and observing the patterns of post-vaccine myocarditis among populations where aspiration is practiced could be helpful.

COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen

A single 0.5 mL dose of undiluted vaccine is given.

Based on a precautionary principle, we recommend aspiration before injection.
