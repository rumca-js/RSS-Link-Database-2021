Happy birthday to Paul Simon! Born Oct. 13, 1941, in Newark, N.J., the singer-songwriter turns 80 today. Simon found much success as half of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, formed in 1956 with childhood pal Art Garfunkel, but he ventured out on his own in 1970 and would go on to find decades of more success as a solo artist. Simon has earned 16 Grammy awards for his solo and collaborative work, including three for Album of the Year ("Bridge Over Troubled Water," "Still Crazy After All These Years" and "Graceland"), and a Lifetime Achievement Award. He is a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame — first in 1990 as a member of Simon & Garfunkel and again in 2001 for his solo career.

In November 2019, Paul Simon performed on an episode of Live From Here, recorded live at the Town Hall in New York City. Watch three performances from that program.
