The latest open beta for Battlefield 2042 is no different, with plenty of silly looking visual bugs and funny physics in action. Here's a quick compilation of some of our favorite so far.\n\nWe've been enjoying the Battlefield 2042 Open Beta which runs October 6-9 and includes Conquest mode on the Orbital map. This beta is the first time players can try out the new specialist system, call-in tablet, and new Plus system that lets them swap weapon attachments on the fly. But with betas come hilarious bugs and glitches. \n\nIt's already been confirmed by DICE that the Beta is running on a months-old version of the game. We're rounding up a quick selection of really funny bugs and glitches including punching bullets into existence and riding a massive rocket into the sky. Battlefield 2042 releases on November 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HbEl8uXSGo", "date_published": "2021-10-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Far Cry Games Ranked", "description": "Following the release of Far Cry 6 on October 7, we're taking a look back at the earlier entries in the series and letting you know which ones are must-plays and which ones are you-should-probably-still-plays.\n\nTIME STAMPS:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:33 - Far Cry 5\n01:26 - Far Cry Primal\n01:59 - Far Cry\n02:30 - Far Cry New Dawn\n03:00 - Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon\n03:47 - Far Cry 4\n04:22 - Far Cry 2\n05:03 - Far Cry 3\n\n#FarCry", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqx1tUFN5tE", "date_published": "2021-10-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts To Far Cry 6\u2019s Guns", "description": "Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the weaponry of Far Cry 6, including the Exterminador, a backpack full of rockets, and the Discos Locos, a CD launcher that plays the Macarena.\n\nIn the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of Far Cry 6 and compares them to their real-life counterparts.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nAnd if you would like to become a member of the Royal Armouries, you can get a membership here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/\n\nYou can purchase Jonathan's book here - https://www.headstamppublishing.com/bullpup-rifle-book\n\nOr at the Royal Armouries shop here. - https://shop.royalarmouries.org/collections/thorneycroft-to-sa80-british-bullpup-firearms-1901-2020", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ibM9QcqGxI", "date_published": "2021-10-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "GTA Trilogy Is Actually Happening | GameSpot News", "description": "In today\u2019s GameSpot News, DeVante talks about the GTA Trilogy being officially confirmed, no rewards or achievements for solo campaigns in Back 4 Blood, and Assassin\u2019s Creed producer Jade Raymond teasing a new game.\u00a0\n\nFollowing weeks of rumor and speculation, Rockstar Games has officially announced a new Grand Theft Auto remaster package featuring GTA III, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas.\u00a0 The GTA Trilogy: The Definitive Edition comes with updated and improved versions of those three games. The bundle will be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and on PC through the Rockstar Games Launcher later this year.\n\nBack 4 Blood is a social game, and developer Turtle Rock Studios doesn't want players to forget that. While playing through a campaign match with others will let players earn supply points, which can be used to purchase cards and cosmetics, the game's solo mode totally cuts players off from all rewards. One upside of Solo Campaign is that players get to use any solo card decks they make, which have access to a wide variety of cards compared to regular campaign decks.\n\nAssassin's Creed producer Jade Raymond has teased the first game from her new studio, Haven, which has aligned itself exclusively with PlayStation. Haven's first game is a new IP that will seem to have an emphasis on social elements, self-expression, and remix concepts. Raymond said Haven's first game is going to be \"really ambitious\" and showcase what the PS5 is capable of and that the game's file size might be massive.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\nIntro - 00:00\nGTA Trilogy - 00:20\u00a0\nBack 4 Blood - 01:48\nHaven - 02:57\nOutro - 04:36", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF6z8fDrDsk", "date_published": "2021-10-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Overwatch 2 Play Test PvP Pro Gameplay", "description": "Get a glimpse of an early version of Overwatch 2 play tests on New York, Dorado, and Havana.
