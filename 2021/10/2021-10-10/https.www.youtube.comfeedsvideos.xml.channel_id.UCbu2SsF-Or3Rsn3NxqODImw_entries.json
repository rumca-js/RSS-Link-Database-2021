Let's take a look back at every game to feature the iconic World War II assault rifle.\n\nWhen Call of Duty launched in 2003, the World War II first-person shooter offered several weapons in both its campaign as well as multiplayer. Of these, the STG44 quickly became one of the most used and recognizable assault rifles. A a well-rounded weapon, the STG has made its way back into several other Call of Duty titles from Call of Duty 2 and 3, to more modern titles like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and 2017's Call of Duty: WWII. \n\nWith every entry, the STG has seen minor changes. Earlier titles offered little in the way of gunsmithing or cosmetic customization, but beginning with Advanced Warfare, the rifle received optional skins and tactical upgrades such as upgradable optics and magazine sizes. For the most part however, the biggest changes include sound design, reload animations, and how close (or far) the player holds the rifle while aiming down sights. Some games like Black Ops 3's Zombies mode also have unique stock iron sights.\n\nWith a strong presence in more than a dozen titles, the STG44 will be returning to the series with Call of Duty: Vanguard this November. Stay tuned to GameSpot for the latest coverage on all things Call of Duty, as well as your other favorite FPS titles like Battlefield and Halo.\n\n\nTime Stamps:\n00:22 - Call of Duty\n01:09 - Call of Duty 2\n02:30 - Call of Duty 2: Big Red One\n03:48 - Call of Duty N-GAGE\n04:33 - Call Of Duty 3\n06:03 - Call of Duty: Roads to Victory\n07:00 - Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\n08:24 - Call of Duty: World at War\n09:03 - World at War Zombies\n09:41 - Call of Duty: World at War DS\n10:37 - Call of Duty: World at War Final Fronts\n11:54 - Call of Duty: Black Ops\n12:55 - Call of Duty: Black Ops 2\n13:43 - Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare\n15:01 - Call of Duty; Black Ops 3\n15:47 - Call of Duty; WWII\n16:34 - WWII Zombies\n17:12 - Call of Duty: Vanguard BETA", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHSlikh22OE", "date_published": "2021-10-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Battlefield 2042 - Bugs & Glitches From The Beta So Far", "description": "Battlefield has had a lot of incredible bugs and glitches that players uncovered over the years.
