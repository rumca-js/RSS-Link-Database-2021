The STG44 (also known as the MP44) has been in Call of Duty games from the very beginning. Let's take a look back at every game to feature the iconic World War II assault rifle.

When Call of Duty launched in 2003, the World War II first-person shooter offered several weapons in both its campaign as well as multiplayer. Of these, the STG44 quickly became one of the most used and recognizable assault rifles. A a well-rounded weapon, the STG has made its way back into several other Call of Duty titles from Call of Duty 2 and 3, to more modern titles like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and 2017's Call of Duty: WWII. 

With every entry, the STG has seen minor changes. Earlier titles offered little in the way of gunsmithing or cosmetic customization, but beginning with Advanced Warfare, the rifle received optional skins and tactical upgrades such as upgradable optics and magazine sizes. For the most part however, the biggest changes include sound design, reload animations, and how close (or far) the player holds the rifle while aiming down sights. Some games like Black Ops 3's Zombies mode also have unique stock iron sights.

With a strong presence in more than a dozen titles, the STG44 will be returning to the series with Call of Duty: Vanguard this November. Stay tuned to GameSpot for the latest coverage on all things Call of Duty, as well as your other favorite FPS titles like Battlefield and Halo.

Battlefield has had a lot of incredible bugs and glitches that players uncovered over the years. The latest open beta for Battlefield 2042 is no different, with plenty of silly looking visual bugs and funny physics in action. Here's a quick compilation of some of our favorite so far.

We've been enjoying the Battlefield 2042 Open Beta which runs October 6-9 and includes Conquest mode on the Orbital map. This beta is the first time players can try out the new specialist system, call-in tablet, and new Plus system that lets them swap weapon attachments on the fly. But with betas come hilarious bugs and glitches. 

It's already been confirmed by DICE that the Beta is running on a months-old version of the game. We're rounding up a quick selection of really funny bugs and glitches including punching bullets into existence and riding a massive rocket into the sky. Battlefield 2042 releases on November 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC.
