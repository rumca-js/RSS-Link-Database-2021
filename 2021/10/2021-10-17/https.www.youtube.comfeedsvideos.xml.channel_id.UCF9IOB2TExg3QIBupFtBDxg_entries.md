Adults: Dosing Regimens

The dose most commonly used in clinical trials is IVM 0.2–0.6 mg/kg PO given as a single dose or as a once-daily dose for up to 5 days.

Adverse events

Generally well tolerated

Dizziness

Pruritis

GI effects (e.g., nausea, diarrhea)

Neurological AEs have been reported when IVM has been used to treat parasitic diseases, 

but it is not clear whether these AEs were caused by IVM or the underlying conditions.

Comments and links to clinical trials

Generally given on an empty stomach with water; however, administering IVM with food increases its bioavailability.

A list of clinical trials is available here: Ivermectin

Alexei Kouprianov, independent analyst and biologist

The data for [Russia] is absolutely unreliable

Recently ex St. Petersburg campus of the Higher School of Economics (September 2020)

Handling of the pandemic, largely left to the regions

Regional officials conceal problems, fear of losing their posts

Therefore critics, even analytical experts, are sidelined

Iceland restricts Moderna

Chief Epidemiologist, Þórólfur Guðnason

Moderna, only be used for booster shots in 60+

Unpublished data from the Nordic countries indicate that the risk of cardiac inflammation after vaccination against COVID-19 is much higher among 18 to 39-year-olds if the Moderna vaccine is used than after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine

Cardiac inflammation after vaccination is much less common among older demographics

In 12 to 17-year-olds, lack of European data

Under 60 who have received a single shot of Modern, to complete their vaccination with Pfizer

Men 18-39 are not recommended to accept the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine
Iceland data, vast majority of vaccination side effects emerge shortly after vaccination

Newly formed advisory group on dangerous pathogens

Mike Ryan

This is our best chance, and it may be our last chance to understand the origins of this virus

take a step back, create an environment where we can again look at the scientific issues

Urged China to provide data from early cases

China, no more visits are needed

Previous WHO team spent four weeks in and around Wuhan

Dr Peter Daszak, recused himself from The Lancet's inquiry commission

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30418-9/fulltext

We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. 

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

Investigation was hampered by a dearth of raw data pertaining to the first days of the outbreak

Has called for lab audits

New, 26 members, Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of 

Novel Pathogens (SAGO)

Maria van Kerkhove, WHO technical lead on COVID-19

Hopes there would be further WHO-led international missions to China,

which would engage the country's cooperation

more than three dozen recommended studies required to determine how the virus crossed from the animal species to humans

Reported Chinese testing for antibodies in Wuhan residents in 2019 will be absolutely critical

Including analyses of stored blood samples from 2019 in Wuhan

and retrospective searches of hospital and mortality data for earlier cases.

Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the UN

Conclusions of the joint study were quite clear

As international teams had been sent to China twice already, it 

is time to send teams to other places
