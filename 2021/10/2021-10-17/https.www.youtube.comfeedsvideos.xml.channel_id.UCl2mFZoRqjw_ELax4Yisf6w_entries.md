This video is an excerpt from my car dash cam while I was having an argument with my girlfriend. She is always looking out for my best interests and as a result, we have different views and opinions on these topics. sometimes the decisions that I make in the pursuit of an ideal are too rigid and idealistic, and do not take into account the reality that you have to look out for yourself before looking out for others. She balances me out there. It also means lots of discussions like this.
