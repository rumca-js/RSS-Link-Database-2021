Over the years veteran Battlefield players have developed a lot of knowledge, tricks, and some unspoken rules. It’s time to pass those skills on to a new generation of Battlefield 2042 players. Here are things every Battlefield player knows that can make you better at the game.

Battlefield 2042 releases in November and may attract a lot of new players, including those coming over from Modern Warfare 2019, who aren’t familiar with the series. Battlefield is a franchise that doesn’t hold your hand as much as Call Of Duty and will let you get yourself into bad situations easily so it’s important to know what you’re doing. The sandbox nature of the game opens up a lot of clever tips and tricks and unexpected things you can do with class gadgets, weapons, vehicles, and destruction. It’s even more complex now that the new specialist system, with things like turrets and grappling hooks, has upended the older class system that itself evolved and changed from 1942, Battlefield 2, 2142, Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 or 4, and World War settings. 

In this video we’re rounding up some of the tips, tricks, and knowledge that Battlefield veterans have gathered over the last two decades in order to catch you up ahead of 2042’s launch. You’ll learn about clever ways to use vehicles, how players use C4 to grief their opponents, why certain gear is misunderstood, how to increase your chances of bailing from a bad situation successfully, odd ways players might try to communicate with you, how to not fall for mind games people play, and why you should try sticking everything to everything. 

These skills will probably come in handy across the three modes coming out at launch which include All-Out-Warfare, Hazard Zone, and Portal. We have only begun to dig into specialists and gadgets with many more releasing over the course of four Battle Passes. Make sure to tell us about your experiences with the Battlefield 2042 Open beta and head on over to GameSpot.com for ongoing coverage.

After nearly 25 years, Grand Theft Auto has made an insane impact on the video game industry. Grand Theft Auto broke new ground after GTA III released, launching Rockstar into the limelight. Since then, the series has become synonymous with high quality open world exploration and freedom. Its locales of Liberty City, Vice City, and Los Santos have become intimately familiar with fans, as well as characters like Tommy Vercetti, Niko Bellic, Trevor Philips, Franklin Clinton, and Michael De Santa. Dave takes a look back at all of the GTAs to rank them worst to best.

Grand Theft Auto made its debut on the original Playstation back in 1997. But, it wouldn’t be until the third iteration, Grand Theft Auto III, that the series truly broke out becoming the household name it is today. Beyond its controversies, there’s good reason these games became so popular, all thanks to the wild amount of freedom and creativity the games employed and still employ to this day. But they need to be ranked! Because ... why not!
