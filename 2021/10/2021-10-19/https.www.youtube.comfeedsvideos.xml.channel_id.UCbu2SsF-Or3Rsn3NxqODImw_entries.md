After nearly 25 years, Grand Theft Auto has made an insane impact on the video game industry. Grand Theft Auto broke new ground after GTA III released, launching Rockstar into the limelight. Since then, the series has become synonymous with high quality open world exploration and freedom. Its locales of Liberty City, Vice City, and Los Santos have become intimately familiar with fans, as well as characters like Tommy Vercetti, Niko Bellic, Trevor Philips, Franklin Clinton, and Michael De Santa. Dave takes a look back at all of the GTAs to rank them worst to best.

Grand Theft Auto made its debut on the original Playstation back in 1997. But, it wouldn’t be until the third iteration, Grand Theft Auto III, that the series truly broke out becoming the household name it is today. Beyond its controversies, there’s good reason these games became so popular, all thanks to the wild amount of freedom and creativity the games employed and still employ to this day. But they need to be ranked! Because ... why not!

In this episode of GameSpot News, we talk about Splinter Cell reportedly getting a new game soon, the Xbox Series X mini-fridge selling out fast, and Microsoft’s plans to buy more studios in the future. 

In this video, DeVante talks about a report from VGC that Ubisoft is working on a new Splinter Cell game. The report shed no light on what type of game the new Splinter Cell might be, though it was described as being a "mainline" entry as opposed to some type of spin-off.

DeVante also talks about the Xbox Series X mini-fridge selling out fast as well as Phil Spencer revealing Microsoft is not done buying studios. Microsoft's last big gaming acquisition was ZeniMax/Bethesda, which it paid $7.5 billion to buy. Microsoft now has 23 game development studios spread across the world, working on a variety of projects.

Rocksteady of Batman Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight fame is finally back! This time, they're continuing the series with Suicide Squad. In Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, you'll play Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark as Amanda Waller pits you against the likes of the Flash, Green Lantern, and a big bad Superman, all likely being mind-controlled by Brainiac. While you'll potentially have Wonder Woman on your side, with a missing Batman, as ever, the odds are definitely not stacked in the Suicide Squad's favor. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League releases to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Playstation 5 in 2022.
