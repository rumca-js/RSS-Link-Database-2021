New descendant of the Delta variant,  Delta, predominant, 99.8% of sequenced cases in England
As of 11 October 2021

Delta, predominant variant, 99.8% of sequenced cases in England 

Delta sublineage newly designated as AY.4.2

There are also small numbers of new cases of Delta with E484K and Delta with E484Q

UK genetic sequencing, 6%, now 8% or more

UK, over a million sequences performed so far

On an increasing trajectory

US, Denmark, Canada

US, 3 cases sequenced, no clusters reported

North Carolina, California, DC

10 cases in Israel, all from US

UK, 14,247 sequenced as of Monday, October 18th 

AY.4.2, Delta Plus, Spike protein change

(AY means it is a delta subtype)

(AY.4 is already 80% in the UK)

Mutations - Y145H and A222V

Found in various lineages since the beginning of the pandemic

Will this give the virus additional powers?

Vaccine escape?

Slight effect on the binding between antibodies and the virus

Not yet a variant of concern or variant under investigation 

WHO, next few days, nu variant

Original Delta, classified as VOC, UK May 2021 

July 2021 experts identified AY.4.2.

Sublineage of Delta, increasing slowly since then

Prof Francois Balloux, University College London, Genetics Institute

It is potentially a marginally more infectious strain.

It's nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like 50 to 60 percent more transmissible. 

So we are talking about something quite subtle here and that is currently under investigation.
 
At this stage I would say wait and see, don't panic. 

it is not something absolutely disastrous like we saw previously

Dr Jeffrey Barrett, Covid-19 Genomics Initiative, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, and Prof Francois Balloux

AY.4.2 could be 10-15% more transmissible than the original Delta variant.

Unlikely to be fuelling current UK increases

(That’s mostly school age and to their parents)

High infection rates in UK, going down in US

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/10/19/people-must-cautious-day-to-day-interactions-covid-cases-climb/

Lower functional immunity in our population than most other 
Western European countries

Early vaccine roll out

AstraZeneca protects slightly less well than Pfizer against infection and transmission, particularly delta variant

Slightly lower overall vaccination coverage, particularly vaccinating teenagers

Fewer social restrictions

High rates of testing

UK, ONS

 https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights

Two vaccine doses give similar protection as previous infection 

Two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca

Provided a similar level of protection as having had a previous natural infection of coronavirus

During delta variant times

Vaccination reduced the risk of testing positive, 

both when the alpha variant was dominant in the UK (1 December 2020 to 16 May 2021) 

and when the delta variant was dominant (17 May to 14 August 2021)

Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech

Reduced the risk of testing positive by 73% in the delta period

Two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca

Reduced the risk of testing positive by 62% in the delta period

Two vaccination doses, more effective than one at preventing symptomatic infection in both periods. 

Three weeks after vaccination

Two doses always more protective than one

(75% v 58%)

Inconsistent with covid symptom study

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/do-i-need-a-covid-vaccine-if-ive-had-covid

Two doses of the Pfizer

87% protection against infection

Two doses of the AstraZeneca

71% protection against infection

Natural infection alone

Only gave 65% protection against catching it again

Israeli data consistent with ONS but inconsistent with covid symptom study

Protection of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to that of BNT162b2 vaccine protection: A three-month nationwide experience from Israel
 https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255670v1.full.pdf

Vaccination was highly effective 

Estimated efficacy for documented infection of 92·8% 
Hospitalization 94·2% 
Severe illness 94·4% 
Death 93·7% 

Protection from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection

Estimated efficacy for documented infection of 94·8% 
Hospitalization 94·1% 
Severe illness 96·4%

All deaths registered in the week to 8 October 

COVID-19 deaths fall in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland
Up in Wales

Total UK deaths in the week, 12,490

14.7% above the average in 2015 to 2019

820 involved the coronavirus (COVID-19)

154 fewer than the previous week

Deaths involving COVID-19, 1 in 15 deaths (6.6%).

UK total deaths include non-residents.

1 million people in UK countries had COVID-19 in the latest week

1.63% in England (1 in 60 people)
One in 70 people the week before

2.18% in Wales (1 in 45 people)
One in 55 people the week before 

0.82% in Northern Ireland (1 in 120 people)
One in 130 people the week before
 
1.26% in Scotland (1 in 80 people)
One in 60 people the week before

Hello John, Just to let you know that one of my posts referring to your video on aspiration has been pulled from LinkedIn.   This is the first time that one of my posts has been pulled and I have put out some pretty controversial posts on other subjects.
