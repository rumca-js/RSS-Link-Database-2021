After nearly a year of more and more M1 products, Apple pro users started to wonder when higher-end chips would become available. The answer is... today, with the M1 Pro and M1 Max. These chip revisions are the Jade-C Chop and Jade-C Die respectively rumored earlier this year. The new 14" MacBook Pro and 16" MacBook Pro are the first machines to support this new silicon and the new MacBook Pro has an entirely new mini-LED display, 120 Hz variable ProMotion, an improved camera, speaker system, microphone array, and more. The Touch Bar is dead (yay!), and a full-height function row has blessed us in its place. But there's a lot more to Apple's announcement you may have missed. Let's check it out.
