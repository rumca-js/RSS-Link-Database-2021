Here's what you need to know about the Orbital map, four specialists, gun attachment system, call-in tablet, and freaking tornadoes.\n\nEA has launched the Battlefield 2042 beta, allowing players to dive into the hugely anticipated all-out warfare Conquest mode. We had an early look at the game during a hands-on preview event with three hours of game time prior to the beta's launch, and we have so much to break down with you all.\n\nIn this video, we talk about our impressions on the core gameplay loop, if Battlefield feels as good as its predecessors, and some of the new quality-of-life changes. From the new vehicle call-in system to the new attachment changes letting you adjust your weapon on the fly, Battlefield 2042 has made a lot of visible tweaks that are sure to change your gameplay up in new and fun ways.\u00a0\n\nThere were also four specialists--the game's equivalent of classes--that we got to use, with McKay getting most of the love thanks to his handy grapple hook and intrinsic mobility perks. We\u2019d also be remiss to not mention the wicked new tornado wrecking havoc on players and the map and how that looked for the first time, as well as breaking down the Orbital map\u2019s rocket launch levolution.

That includes how to build or find powerful guns, the pros and cons of semi-powerful Supremos and Resolver Weapons, the usefulness of stealth, how to level your initial Alligator pet, what to focus on with base-building, how gear lets you punch above your level, and why side missions matter.
