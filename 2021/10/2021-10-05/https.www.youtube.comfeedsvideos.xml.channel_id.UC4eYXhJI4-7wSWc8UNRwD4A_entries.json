Performing his entire \"El Tiny\" set live from an unassuming barbershop chair in The Bronx, the Dominican-American superstar dazzles in this homecoming performance with the unguarded swagger characteristic of a true rey de la gente.\n\nPrince Royce instantly grips ears and hearts with a stunning performance of \"Coraz\u00f3n Sin Cara.\" Leading with buttery vocals and easy electric guitar riffs, he serves smooth verses with the kind of suave appeal that would leave any viewer wanting to be a bachata princess. Transitioning between tracks with a sweet note about representing la cultura, he dives straight in with more traditional bachata beats in a performance of his recent release \"Carita de Inocente.\"\n\nThe barbershop is where the prince discovered the building blocks to create an empire in the image of a people and culture that feel like home. In an intimate moment between songs, Prince Royce shares that it was where he would go to hear what people were listening to in the streets \u2014 bachata, merengue, mambo. His New York Dominican sound feels natural in the space.\n\"Porque me recuerda a mis inicios (because it reminds me of my beginnings),\" he says of his choice in stage.\n\nFrom there he delivers \"Lao o Lao,\" an impassioned song about willingly giving up lavish objects for love. He closes out the show with a performance of a tropical, legacy pick \"Darte un Beso.\"\nPrince Royce's \"El Tiny\" concert makes it easy to imagine a curly-haired kid sitting in that same, too-big-for-him silla, dreaming of a day when the chair would fit just right and he could come back to his barrio and own the seat as royalty.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Coraz\u00f3n Sin Cara\"\n \u2022 \"Carita de Inocente\"\n \u2022 \"Lao' a Lao'\"\n \u2022 \"Darte Un Beso\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Prince Royce: vocals\n \u2022 Christopher Mercedes: bass\n \u2022 Gio Williams: guitar\n \u2022 Johan Beltre: keyboard\n \u2022 Otoniel Vargas: drums\n \u2022 Christopher Vegazo: g\u00fcira\n \u2022 Wellington Flores: bongos\n \u2022 Brisila Barros: vocals\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Javier Ca\u00f1izales, Daniel Eguren\n \u2022 Audio: Jose \"Sapo\" Gonzalez, Javier Delgado, Joe Lizano\n \u2022 Musical Director: Christopher Mercedes\n \u2022 Executive Producers: Mayte Calzacorta, Gaby Herrera\n \u2022 Production Manager: William Cortes\n \u2022 Assistant Director: Rafael Yanez\n \u2022 Art Department: Natacha Casafus\n \u2022 Creative Direction: Daniel Eguren, Gaby Herrera\n \u2022 Post Supervision: Pimpi Castro\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producers: Anamaria Sayre, Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Alt.Latino 'El Tiny' Team: Felix Contreras, Reanna Cruz, Ana\u00efs Laurent, Stefanie Fernandez\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#princeroyce #eltiny #nprmusic #tinydesk", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jLebs9xraI", "date_published": "2021-10-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
