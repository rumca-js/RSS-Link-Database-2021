UK, high prevalence maintained

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-not-showing-signs-of-dropping

End of September

Based on 39,742 recent swab tests, between 11th and 25th 
September 2021

58,126 new daily symptomatic cases

Based on PCR and LFT test data

In the fully vaccinated population, 14,352 new daily symptomatic cases

Overall UK Prevalence

On average 1 in 93 people in the UK have symptomatic COVID

Increase mostly in under 19s

Uptick in the number of active cases in people aged 20-50

Cases remain low and stable in contributors over the age of 50

UK R around 1.1

England, 1.1

Wales, 1.1 (currently increasing)

Scotland, 1.0

ZOE’s predicted Long COVID incidence rate

804 people a day will go on to experience symptoms for longer than 12 weeks

Professor Tim Spector

We’re seeing infections being passed up the generational ladder, likely from school children to their parents. 

Most of these new adult infections are in the under 50s, who still have a relatively low risk of being admitted to hospital, especially if they’ve been fully vaccinated.

As the winter approaches, it’s important parents of school-aged children and students don’t pass the virus on to more vulnerable grandparents by not recognising simple cold-like symptoms as a possible COVID infection. 

This is a critical time and a little caution could make all the difference in avoiding a winter crisis for hospitals.

Drugs Shown to Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 Disease: Comparative Basic and Clinical Pharmacology of Molnupiravir and Ivermectin

There are still many nations where vaccines are not yet widely available, 

There is a gradual shift in focus, to antiviral drugs, 

Adjunctive chemoprophylaxis

Active treatment of new SARS-CoV-2 infections

Post -vaccination breakthrough COVID-19 cases

The two ways to get new drugs

Develop novel antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 

Repurpose existing FDA -approved drugs to treat COVID-19

Ivermectin is the most studied “repurposed” medication globally, 

in randomized clinical trials, retrospective studies and meta- analyses. 

Molnupiravir and Ivermectin Anti-SARS- CoV-2 Mechanisms, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 

Molnupiravir is a broad spectrum antiviral agent against SARS- CoV-2, SARS-CoV,

seasonal or pandemic influenza and MERS corona virus

Ivermectin is an FDA-approved, WHO essential drug used as broad spectrum antiparasitic, antibiotic 

and which has demonstrated broad spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, including HIV, Zika, MERS corona virus

The FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011

5000-fold inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, (99.98% at 48 hours

The inhibitory concentration IC50 of Molnupiravir shows it to be a more potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent, compared to Ivermectin in vitro. 

Both molnupiravir and ivermectin are well absorbed after oral dosing

Tmax of molnupiravir being 1-1.75 hours,

With a half life of 7 hours

Tmax of ivermectin is 4-6 hours

Very long half life of 81-91 hours
Ivermectin, being lipophilic has a large volume of distribution

Ivermectin has the ability to accumulate in the lungs

The anti-SARS-CoV-2 actions, both of molnupiravir and ivermectin, are dose and concentration dependent

Molnupiravir active metabolite (NHC-5’ Triphosphate), acts as a competitive alternative substrate for viral RNA

causing viral mutagenesis or mutations, which leads to viral error catastrophe and extinction of replication

There is some concern about the safety of NHC -nucleoside triphosphate, which is also mutagenic to mammalian cells

Ivermectin, multifarious actions, 

Binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S

Reducing cell entry via human ACE2 receptors 

Reducing viral transcription

Inhibition of cytokine production and inflammation
(not yet been shown for molnupiravir) 

Complimentary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs

May be additive or synergistic

This should be further investigated in anti-SARS- CoV-2 antiviral combination therapy.

A combination of molnupiravir with Ivermectin putatively, in effects on RdRP or cytokine release. 

Cost

https://www.who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/21/reviews/Ivermectin_Review1.pdf

The cost for a package of 100 tablets of 3 mg ivermectin is $2.96.

Say, 12mg per day for 5 days = $0.53

Main results, Treating people in hospital with COVID-19

We don't know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care, 28 days after treatment:– 

leads to more or fewer deaths

worsens or improves patients' condition assessed by need for ventilation or oxygen

increases or reduces unwanted events

Preventing COVID-19

We don't know whether ivermectin leads to more or fewer deaths compared with no drug
