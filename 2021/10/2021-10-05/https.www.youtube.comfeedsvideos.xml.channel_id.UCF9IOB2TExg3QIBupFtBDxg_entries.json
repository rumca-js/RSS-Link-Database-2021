under 50s, who still have a relatively low risk of being admitted to hospital, especially if they\u2019ve been fully vaccinated.\n\nAs the winter approaches, it\u2019s important parents of school-aged children and students don\u2019t pass the virus on to more vulnerable grandparents by not recognising simple cold-like symptoms as a possible COVID infection. \n\nThis is a critical time and a little

infections\n\nPost -vaccination breakthrough COVID-19 cases\n\nThe two ways to get new drugs\n\nDevelop novel antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 \n\nRepurpose existing FDA -approved drugs to treat COVID-19\n\nIvermectin is the most studied \u201crepurposed\u201d medication globally, \n\nin randomized clinical trials, retrospective studies and meta- analyses. \n\nMolnupiravir and Ivermectin Anti-SARS- CoV-2 Mechanisms, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics \n\nMolnupiravir is a broad spectrum antiviral agent against SARS- CoV-2, SARS-CoV,\n\nseasonal or pandemic influenza and MERS corona virus\n\nIvermectin is an FDA-approved, WHO essential drug used as broad spectrum antiparasitic, antibiotic \n\nand which has demonstrated broad spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, including HIV, Zika, MERS corona virus\n\nThe FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011\n\n5000-fold inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, (99.98% at 48 hours\n\nThe inhibitory concentration IC50 of Molnupiravir shows it to be a more potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent, compared to Ivermectin in vitro. \n\nBoth molnupiravir and ivermectin are well absorbed after oral dosing\n\nTmax of molnupiravir being 1-1.75 hours,\n\nWith a half life of 7 hours\n\nTmax of ivermectin is 4-6 hours\n\nVery long half life of 81-91 hours\nIvermectin, being lipophilic has a large volume of distribution\n\nIvermectin has the ability to accumulate in the lungs\n\nThe anti-SARS-CoV-2 actions, both of molnupiravir and ivermectin, are dose and concentration dependent\n\nMolnupiravir active metabolite (NHC-5\u2019 Triphosphate), acts as a competitive alternative substrate for viral RNA\n\ncausing viral mutagenesis or mutations, which leads to viral error catastrophe and extinction of replication\n\nThere is some concern about the safety of NHC -nucleoside triphosphate, which is also mutagenic to mammalian cells\n\nIvermectin, multifarious actions, \n\nBinding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S\n\nReducing cell entry via human ACE2 receptors \n\nReducing viral transcription\n\nInhibition of cytokine production and inflammation\n(not yet been shown for molnupiravir) \n\nComplimentary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs\n\nMay be additive or synergistic\n\nThis should be further investigated in anti-SARS- CoV-2 antiviral combination therapy.\n\nA combination of molnupiravir with Ivermectin putatively, in
