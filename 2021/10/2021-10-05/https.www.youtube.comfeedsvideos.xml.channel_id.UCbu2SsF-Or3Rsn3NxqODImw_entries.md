While you are pre-loading Battlefield 2042 ahead of the beta release we're here to tell you about what you're going to play. Here's what you need to know about the Orbital map, four specialists, gun attachment system, call-in tablet, and freaking tornadoes.

EA has launched the Battlefield 2042 beta, allowing players to dive into the hugely anticipated all-out warfare Conquest mode. We had an early look at the game during a hands-on preview event with three hours of game time prior to the beta's launch, and we have so much to break down with you all.

In this video, we talk about our impressions on the core gameplay loop, if Battlefield feels as good as its predecessors, and some of the new quality-of-life changes. From the new vehicle call-in system to the new attachment changes letting you adjust your weapon on the fly, Battlefield 2042 has made a lot of visible tweaks that are sure to change your gameplay up in new and fun ways. 

There were also four specialists--the game's equivalent of classes--that we got to use, with McKay getting most of the love thanks to his handy grapple hook and intrinsic mobility perks. We’d also be remiss to not mention the wicked new tornado wrecking havoc on players and the map and how that looked for the first time, as well as breaking down the Orbital map’s rocket launch levolution. For more Battlefield 2042, be sure to stick to GameSpot!

Far Cry 6 can be a pretty tough game at first if you don’t have an understanding of weapon builds, gear, and crafting systems. In this video, we’ll get you caught up on the essential places to focus and things you should know to enjoy the mayhem. 

Far Cry 6 draws its systems and inspiration from a lot of past Far Cry games, including many RPG mechanics from New Dawn. The game sports a fairly punishing leveling system unless you know what you’re doing. There’s a lot to learn at first, including gun customization and modding, how to find unique weapons, base building, Amigos, superweapons, and the various crafting systems you need to learn to level your gear. 

In this video, we’re going to focus you on the essential things to know. That includes how to build or find powerful guns, the pros and cons of semi-powerful Supremos and Resolver Weapons, the usefulness of stealth, how to level your initial Alligator pet, what to focus on with base-building, how gear lets you punch above your level, and why side missions matter. We’re also going to tackle how to sort out where to find upgrading resources and how to fight some very aggressive and tanky choppers. 

Far Cry 6 releases on October 7 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC. For more news, season pass updates, including DLC around Blood Dragon as well as classic villains like Vaas, and videos about Far Cry, including a full review, head on over to GameSpot.com.

The Nintendo Switch OLED is a more impressive update than you'd expect thanks to the gorgeous screen.
Description: The Nintendo Switch OLED is a marked improvement over the original and Switch Lite. If you play a lot in handheld mode, the OLED model is a surprisingly huge upgrade. And if you don't play your Switch in handheld mode often, the Switch OLED's new screen is impressive enough that it could change that. 

The Nintendo Switch OLED will be available on October 8, 2021. You can read the full written Nintendo Switch OLED review by Steven Petite on GameSpot.

## Far Cry 6 - Secret Early Alternate Ending

You can beat Far Cry 6 early and get a secret alternate ending at the beginning of the game. Here's how to do it.

To get this ending yourself you'll need to play the opening first island of the game. This does require a few hours of play, so it's not as easy to get as it was in Far Cry 4 and 5. After you destroy the blockade preventing you from leaving, Dani will make their way to Libertad's headquarters.

As promised Clara Garcia will give Dani a boat to sail to America, but also plead with them to stay and help liberate Yara. After the cutscene you'll be left on the dock with the boat. Most players will of course stay and continue the fight against Anton Castillo, but if you do get on the boat and sail towards the edge of the map, you'll trigger the game's alternate ending.

Dani will be lounging on a beach in America while a news report details Anton's victory over Libertad. Getting this ending will net you the trophy/achievement "Hidden In Plain Sight".

With the release of Far Cry 6, we went back to the beginning to chart how Ubisoft's open-world franchise evolved from tech demo to AAA behemoth. 

Far Cry had humble beginnings. It started life as a tech demo made by then-unknown developer Crytek and, over time, managed to become one of Ubisoft's tentpole franchises. 

In this video we chart the history of the franchise, from the 2004 PC hit that laid the groundwork of the franchise, through to Far Cry 2's divisive malaria mechanic, Far Cry 3's outstanding villain, Far Cry 4's traversal, and the politics of Far Cry 5, coming all the way up to 2021's Far Cry 6. Of course, we spend time discussing the infamous Uwe Boll movie, as well as the iconic villains that helped shape the series to what it's known best for today. 

Far Cry 6 launches on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, and Luna on October 7. For more on the game subscribe or head over to GameSpot.com, where you can also learn more about Ubisoft's employees taking action to change to hostile company culture, and how the company itself has responded.

The Metroid franchise has a sprawling timeline that weaves its sci-fi saga across 11 mainline games. But how does everything tie together?

Metroid Dread marks the conclusion of a story arc dating back 35 years, which takes in the original Metroid, Metroid 2: Return of Samus, Super Metroid, and Metroid Fusion. Hence, y’know, Metroid 5. 

But that chronology doesn’t even take into account the Metroid Prime trilogy and its various handheld spin-offs, or even Metroid: Other M. So with Metroid Dread set to expand the canon and conclude Samus’ long-standing mission to exterminate the Metroids, what better time to recap the franchise’s entire story.

The above video breaks down the Metroid franchise's timeline from Samus' iconic confrontation with Mother Brain all the way through to Metroid Fusion and Metroid Dread.
