Kubesail sent me their brand-new PiBox mini 2. It's a 2-drive SATA NAS built with the Compute Module 4. It has a front-panel LCD, native SATA, and more!

I did have a little trouble with the early prototype model they sent, but was able to get that fixed and now have 16 TB of raw storage, and a nice little managed microk8s installation, to boot!
