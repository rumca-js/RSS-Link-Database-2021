Call of Duty: Warzone has made strides as one of the largest free-to-play games ever. Over the last year and a half, Warzone's success has fluctuated with integrations both from Black Ops Cold War and Vanguard, hacker accounts, and more. Let's reflect on Warzone and see where it started, where it's at, and where it could go next. 

TIMESTAMPS:
00:34 - Where it Started
02:12 - Where it's Been
05:03 - Where it's Going

In less than 2 years, Call of Duty: Warzone has left its impact on the Battle Royale gaming space. After the successful launch, the free-to-play title soared in popularity with fans from all walks of FPS and in mere months, player count rose to the multi-millions. Today, well after the initial hype has come and gone, we’ve seen the good and bad size of Warzone. With plans to eliminate hackers and an all new Vanguard Pacific map on the way, what does the future of Warzone look like?    

In the beginning, Warzone was undeniably a runaway success. Unfortunately, when issues like hacker accounts and overpowered weapons began to plague the game, the experience quickly became unfavorable. With continued balancing, Warzone remains a somewhat stable experience. Events like “The Haunting” and “Know Your History” served as short distractions that mixed up gameplay and even had players working together, but only time will tell if the overall success of warzone can hold.

Eidos-Montréal's Guardians of the Galaxy digs into the weird side of Marvel comics to deliver a fulfilling story about the titular heroes.

Jordan enjoyed his time blasting baddies and cracking wise as Peter Quill (though, moreso the latter than the former) in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, completing the campaign in 16 hours. He played on PlayStation 5 using a code provided by publisher Square Enix.
