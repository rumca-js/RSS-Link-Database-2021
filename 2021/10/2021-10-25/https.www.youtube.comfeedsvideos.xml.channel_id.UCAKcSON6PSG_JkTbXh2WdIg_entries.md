Four years ago, on October 25, 2017, Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile visited The Current for a session in the studio. 

Was it any wonder that Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile became friends? Having shared mutual friends, an overlapping touring schedule and common musical interests, it seemed inevitable. "We started running into each other at shows and festivals and stuff, and we had some mutual Melbourne friends, where I'm from," Barnett said during her and Vile's 2017 session at The Current.

The friends quickly became musical collaborators, and their resulting album, "Lotta Sea Lice," is evidence of their productive cross-pollination. "I've worked with different people in my life," Vile said, "and [Barnett is] the ultimate because I got to make a whole record with her, which I wouldn't have been able to do with others I've played with in the past, because it didn't click in the same way."
