Today, we're going to talk about GNOME. GNOME has been taking steps to be a more viable platform for application developers. They've revamped their app store to make apps more discoverable and more appealing, they've split GTK from the GNOME-related stuff, and they're also going to limit theming capabilities to ensure that app developers have a stable target for their apps. We've heard a lot of stuff on that topic, some misinformed, some true, so let's see what exactly is happening, and what the consequences are.
