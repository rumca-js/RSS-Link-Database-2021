Imminent drops in infections

Cases could fall to around 5,000 a day before Christmas

Prof John Edmunds, Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, LSHTM

Member of SAGE

Our model was projecting that cases would start to decline some time in the autumn. 

However, the model also suggests that cases may start to climb again in the spring, 

due to a combination of waning immunity and increased contacts

Cases currently being driven by high case rates in children

Virus is close to reaching “endemic equilibrium” 

Recent oscillations in case rates will soon level

Rishi Sunak

at the moment the data does not suggest that we should be immediately moving to 'Plan B

Maggie Throup, UK vaccines minister

'Plan A' is working, situation where we need to be

United States

Pfizer for children, 5 to 11, FDA votes for EMU tomorrow

From first half of November

2 shots, 3 weeks gap

One third of adult dose

25,000 centres signed up for roll out

Results are the first from a pivotal trial of any COVID-19 vaccine in children under 12 years of age

In participants 5 to 11 years of age, the vaccine was safe, well tolerated and showed robust neutralizing antibody responses

Phase 2/3 study

United States, Finland, Poland, Spain

Children 6 months to 11 years of age

N = 2,268 5 to 11 years of age

Received a 10 µg dose level in a two-dose regimen

Strong SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing antibody response,

one month after the second dose

Continue to accumulate the safety and efficacy data

Topline readouts for the other two age cohorts from the trial, soon

Children 2-5 years of age

Children 6 months to 2 years of age

About the Phase 1/2/3 Trial in Children

N = 4,500 children ages 6 months to 11 years

More than 90 clinical trial sites

Children under 5 received a 3 µg dose

Trial enrolled children with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection

Reduction in self-reported long COVID after vaccination

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19vaccinationandselfreportedlongcovidintheuk/25october2021

Identified themselves as experiencing persistent symptoms 12 weeks after first infection

A first vaccine dose was associated with an initial 13% decrease in self-reported long COVID,

and a further 9% sustained decrease after receiving the second vaccination

No evidence of differences in self-reported between Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, compared to Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines

Don’t aspirate extrapolation

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/administration.html

Aspiration before injection of vaccines or toxoids (i.e., pulling back on the syringe plunger after needle insertion but before injection)

is not necessary because no large blood vessels are present at the recommended injection sites, 

and a process that includes aspiration might be more painful for infants
