The small but mighty Arturia Microfreak got a new Wavetable update, but that's only the beginning of what I want to show you. We'll take a look at the wavetable engine, and then I'll show you how you can turn the Microfreak into a fidget house monster using the Ocean Swift MIDI controllers and K-Devices Modulators 21 in Ableton.
