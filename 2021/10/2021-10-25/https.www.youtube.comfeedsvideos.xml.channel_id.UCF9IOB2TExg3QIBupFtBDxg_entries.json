infections\n\nCases could fall to around 5,000 a day before Christmas\n\nProf John Edmunds, Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, LSHTM\n\nMember of SAGE\n\nOur model was projecting that cases would start to decline some time in the autumn. \n\nHowever, the model also suggests that cases may start to climb again in the spring, \n\ndue to a combination of waning immunity and increased contacts\n\nCases currently being driven by high case rates in children\n\nVirus is close to reaching \u201cendemic equilibrium\u201d \n\nRecent oscillations in case rates will soon level\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nat the moment the data does not suggest that we should be immediately moving to 'Plan B\n\nMaggie Throup, UK vaccines minister\n\n'Plan A' is working, situation where we
