Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections in 620,000 U.S. Veterans, February 1, 2021 to August 13, 2021

National data on COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections is inadequate

Comparing SARS CoV-2 infection by vaccination status

February 1, 2021 to August 13, 2021

Veterans Health Administration

Covering 2.7% of the U.S. population

Vaccine protection declined by mid-August 2021

Decreasing from 91.9% in March

Down to 53.9%

(p less than 0.01, n=619,755)

Declines were greatest for the Janssen vaccine followed by Pfizerâ€“BioNTech and Moderna. 

Specifically, for protection against infection

Janssen
March, 92%
August, 3%

Moderna
March, 91%
August, 64%

Pfizer
March, 95%
August, 50%

Delta variant as the primary determinant of infection

It is not yet clear whether reductions in vaccine protection against infection will translate into similar reductions in protection against hospitalization and death. 

Vaccines remain the most important tool to prevent infection, severe illness, and death,
 
but vaccines should be accompanied by additional measures, including masking, hand washing, physical distancing, and other public health interventions

The COVID-19 vaccine is backed by science and is no way influenced by horoscopes

But come on Scorpios!
