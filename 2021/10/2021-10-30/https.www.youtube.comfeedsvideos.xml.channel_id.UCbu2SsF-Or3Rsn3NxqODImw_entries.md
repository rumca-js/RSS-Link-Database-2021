From Resident Evil and Silent Hill to Amnesia and PT, these games stand out as genre defining. While the horror genre was one of the earlier game genres, it has evolved over the years with new ideas and ways to spook players. These are the 13 games that defined horror.

Dave takes a look at a horror timeline, from the origins of horror with Mystery House to how Sweet Home and Alone in the Dark would inspire Resident Evil. Whether it be The 7th Guest inspiring the likes of D and Phantasmagoria or how Amnesia would inspire games like SOMA, Outlast, and Layers of Fear.
