On Friday, The Current's Mac Wilson spoke to Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs about that band's new album, "I Don't Live Here Anymore," which was released today (Oct. 29, 2021). In the course of their conversation, Wilson and Granduciel reflected on a MicroShow that The War on Drugs recorded for The Current back in 2017. "Legendary show for us within the group," Granduciel said. "It was amazing. … We still talk about that show."
