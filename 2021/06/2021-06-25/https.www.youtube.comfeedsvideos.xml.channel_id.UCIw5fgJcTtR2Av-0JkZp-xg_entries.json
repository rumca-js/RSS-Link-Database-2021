I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.\" - Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills\n\nCreated with Teenage Engineering OP-1 and completed in Logic Pro X using stock plugins and instruments.\n\nVHS glitch footage by Christopher Huppertz:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLEANTxyZzGnBIPyHnjq6kw", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR6yxAYr3-s", "date_published": "2021-06-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
