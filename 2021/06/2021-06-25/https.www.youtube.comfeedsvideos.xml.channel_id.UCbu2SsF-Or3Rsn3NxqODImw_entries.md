Learn about what's new, what's leaving, and what you should be playing on Game Pass. This your Game Pass digest for June 26, 2021.

Game Pass has a lot of games, and twice a month there's more coming, and some leaving. It can be a lot to keep track of, not to mention figuring out what to play from its massive library. That's why we created the Game Pass Show.

Join Persia to learn what's new, what's leaving, and what you should consider playing. This week, Game Pass sees the arrival of Limbo, Gang Beasts, Iron Harvest and more. Persia also takes the time to elaborate on her time playing Sea of Thieves' latest DLC, A Pirate's Life. 

Also, make sure to stick to the end for the pick of the week - a section where Persia hand picks either a hidden gem, or sheds some light on a game you should check out before it leaves Game Pass.

The story of Scarlet Nexus might be a mess, but fun action and great character moments make it worth your time.

Heidi played through all of Yuito’s story and some of Kasane’s path for this review. She put in about 28 hours of total playtime. Kagero is her favorite team buddy, if only because she loves ambushing enemies without having to worry about that whole “stealth” nonsense. PlayStation 5 review code was provided by the publisher.

E3 2021 had heavy hitters like Halo Infinite, Starfield, and Metroid Dread, but the unsuspecting champions of this year's E3 were the indies.

Unlike previous E3s, giant AAA games weren't the only ones soaking up the limelight. 

Instead, indies and other hidden gems like the retro-futuristic action game Replaced got its fair share of stardom, standing toe-to-toe with some of the loudest titles like Arkane Studios' upcoming Redfall.

E3 2021 may not have delivered on all fronts for a lot of players who've been eagerly awaiting that next big look at Perfect Dark, God of War Raganarok, or Metroid Prime 4. But what it did deliver on was giving us a taste of something we didn't know we wanted, and that taste is something fresh, new, and unexpecting, with each game offering something drastically different.

Soup Pot is a chaotic cooking simulator with over a 100 real recipes to learn;  Tinykin is a colorful and animated take on Pikmin; Replaced offers a gritty, and refreshing take on the cyberpunk genre, giving 2D pixel art a cinematic flare rarely seen attempted; El Paso, Elsewhere is a spiritual successor to Max Payne, featuring a prominent black lead. It felt like there was something for everyone.

So while you may not have gotten the big update you were hoping for on Diablo 4, or Avowed, here's 23 hidden gems to keep an eye on in the meantime.
