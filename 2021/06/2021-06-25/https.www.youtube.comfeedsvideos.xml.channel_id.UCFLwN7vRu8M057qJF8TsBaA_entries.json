Brought to you by Raycon\n\nFALLOUT IS BACK\n\nI\u2019ve decided to cash in on my vague experience with Fallout and review every single one, and of course find out if they are absolute nightmares. My current plan is\n\nFallout 2 (Next month), Fallout 3, Fallout 3 DLC, a secret extra Fallout 3 video, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Fallout 4 VR mods.\n\nPatreon bros: https://www.patreon.com/UpIsNotJump \nMerch-o-bros: https://www.pixelempire.com/pages/upisnotjump\nTwitter-o-fish: https://twitter.com/UpIsNotJump\n\nI then might do the Metroid series, I plan on doing it, it just depends if I will do it next.\n\nIn between these videos I have some science and history videos in the works I will likely do:\nGame video, science video, game video, science, and so on.\n\nA special thanks to my members!!\nSiberial\nSuperhero3807", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FefojKww11U", "date_published": "2021-06-25 21:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
