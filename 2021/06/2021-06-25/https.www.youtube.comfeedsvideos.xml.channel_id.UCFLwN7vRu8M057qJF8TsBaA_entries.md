FALLOUT IS BACK

Iâ€™ve decided to cash in on my vague experience with Fallout and review every single one, and of course find out if they are absolute nightmares. My current plan is

Fallout 2 (Next month), Fallout 3, Fallout 3 DLC, a secret extra Fallout 3 video, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Fallout 4 VR mods.

I then might do the Metroid series, I plan on doing it, it just depends if I will do it next.

In between these videos I have some science and history videos in the works I will likely do:
Game video, science video, game video, science, and so on.

A special thanks to my members!!
