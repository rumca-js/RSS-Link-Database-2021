University of Oxford

Investigating treatments for people at more risk of serious illness from COVID-19

N = 5,106 so far

Ivermectin is a safe, broad spectrum antiparasitic drug which is in wide use globally to treat parasitic infections.

Known antiviral properties

Small pilot studies show that early administration with ivermectin can reduce viral load and the duration of symptoms in some patients with mild COVID-19.

Professor Chris Butler

Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences

Joint Chief Investigator

Ivermectin is readily available globally, 

has been in wide use for many other infectious conditions so itâ€™s a well-known medicine with a good safety profile, 

and because of the early promising results in some studies it is already being widely used to treat COVID-19 in several countries.

By including ivermectin in a large-scale trial like PRINCIPLE, we hope to generate robust evidence to determine how effective the treatment is against COVID-19, 

and whether there are benefits or harms associated with its use

Treatment group

Three-day course of oral ivermectin 

Control group

Standard NHS care

The trial is supported by a vast network of health and care professionals in care homes, pharmacies, NHS 111 Hubs, hospitals and more than 1400 GP practices across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
