This your Game Pass digest for June 26, 2021.\n\nGame Pass has a lot of games, and twice a month there's more coming, and some leaving. It can be a lot to keep track of, not to mention figuring out what to play from its massive library. That's why we created the Game Pass Show.\n\nJoin Persia to learn what's new, what's leaving, and what you should consider playing. This week, Game Pass sees the arrival of Limbo, Gang Beasts, Iron Harvest and more. Persia also takes the time to elaborate on her time playing Sea of Thieves' latest DLC, A Pirate's Life. \n\nAlso, make sure to stick to the end for the pick of the week - a section where Persia hand picks either a hidden gem, or sheds some light on a game you should check out before it leaves Game Pass.\n\n#gamepass #gangbeasts #limbo #seaofthieves", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrGe7UL--uM", "date_published": "2021-06-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Scarlet Nexus Video Review", "description": "The story of Scarlet Nexus might be a mess, but fun action and great character moments make it worth your time.\n\nHeidi played through all of Yuito\u2019s story and some of Kasane\u2019s path for this review.

But what it did deliver on was giving us a taste of something we didn't know we wanted, and that taste is something fresh, new, and unexpecting, with each game offering something drastically different.\n\nSoup Pot is a chaotic cooking simulator with over a 100 real recipes to learn;  Tinykin is a colorful and animated take on Pikmin; Replaced offers a gritty, and refreshing take on the cyberpunk genre, giving 2D pixel art a cinematic flare rarely seen attempted; El Paso, Elsewhere is a spiritual successor to Max Payne, featuring a prominent black lead. It felt like there was something for everyone.\n\nSo while you may not have gotten the big update you were hoping for on Diablo 4, or Avowed, here's 23 hidden gems to keep an eye on in the meantime.\n\n#e32021", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g48QZBQ35-w", "date_published": "2021-06-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Elden Ring - Everything We Know So Far", "description": "Hidetaka Miyazaki revealed all new details about Elden Ring, Dark Souls spiritual successor, in a number of now translated interviews - including from Famitsu.
