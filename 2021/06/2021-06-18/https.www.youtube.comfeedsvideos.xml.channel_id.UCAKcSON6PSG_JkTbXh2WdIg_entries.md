Early in their career, Davina Lozier of Davina & The Vagabonds saw music as a competition. But now, all they want to do is make people dance.

This clip is from The Current's weekly conversation series LineCheck. On June 15, 2021, panelists Annie Mack, Nazeem, and Davina Lozier gathered via Zoom to discuss music and mental health. Mary Bue opened and closed the evening with performances from her album "The World is Your Lover."

ABOUT THE PERFORMERS

House of Dance Twin Cities — Established in 2014, House of Dance Twin Cities is Minnesota's first and premier dance studio dedicated to teaching breakdancing, popping and locking, and hip hop dance classes to people of all ages and experience levels. The instructors humbly maintain that they are students themselves, dedicated to improving their dance so that they can share more with others. They take their art and their jobs very seriously and appreciate everyone who entrusts their learning with them.

Koo Koo Kanga Roo is a dance party of the senses. For the last 12 years, lifelong friends and collaborators Bryan and Neil have toured the globe delighting fans with their high-energy music, infectious positivity, and interactive live show. Of course, the global pandemic of 2020 threatened to put an end to the carefree fun that had come to define the band, but instead of putting the group on pause or looking for office jobs, Bryan and Neil doubled down and created their most triumphant and expansive album yet.

Siama's Congo Roots — Back in Africa, Siama Matuzungidi recorded hundreds of songs and toured the world with popular artists. Now based in Minneapolis, he's known for his catchy songs, rhythmic guitar, spirited singing and traditional instruments like mbira, balafon and lokole. His wife and musical partner, Dallas Johnson, plays shakers and encourages everyone to sing along in Lingala, Kikongo and English as they bring Siama's rural childhood to life. They've earned World Music Pedagogy certificates from Smithsonian Folkways, and they're Teaching Musicians for COMPAS, Classical MPR's 'Class Notes' and the Schubert Club. Their children's album, "Land of Yangalele" received a Parents' Choice Parent-Approved award.
