As of 2008, Mississippi \u2014 where Emmett Till was murdered \u2014 had the largest number of cases. \n\nJames meets Walter Henry, a Black FBI agent who worked in a field office there and was tasked with investigating many of these crimes. \n\nOne name from the list, a Black serviceman who was killed by a white police officer in 1962 following an altercation at a bus station, offers some insight into how civil rights era killings were handled. The man\u2019s son recollects how his family carried with them the trauma of his father\u2019s death and how the FBI\u2019s re-examination of the case still impacts them today..\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.
