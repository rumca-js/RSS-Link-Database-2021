On this episode of The Bee Weekly, Kyle and Ethan are joined by Kira Davis! They talk about the Bee fighting the New York Times and winning, the Tolkien Society going full on woke, and also try to figure out what the heck “race-norming” is. As usual, there is glorious hate mail and plenty of weird news.
