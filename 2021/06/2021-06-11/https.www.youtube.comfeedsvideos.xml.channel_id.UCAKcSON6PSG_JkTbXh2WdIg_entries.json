The instructors humbly maintain that they are students themselves, dedicated to improving their dance so that they can share more with others. They take their art and their jobs very seriously and appreciate everyone who entrusts their learning with them.\n\nKoo Koo Kanga Roo is a dance party of the senses. For the last 12 years, lifelong friends and collaborators Bryan and Neil have toured the globe delighting fans with their high-energy music, infectious positivity, and interactive live show. Of course, the global pandemic of 2020 threatened to put an end to the carefree fun that had come to define the band, but instead of putting the group on pause or looking for office jobs, Bryan and Neil doubled down and created their most triumphant and expansive album yet.\n\nNur-D is taking the hip-hop world by storm! One of Minnesota's fastest-rising stars, Nur-D has been everywhere, including First Avenue, Paisley Park and US Bank Stadium. With his powerful vocals, witty lyricism, and heart laid out on every track, it's no wonder that Nur-D is on the way to becoming everyone's seventh-favorite hip-hop person.\n\nSaulPaul is an award-winning musician with a message. In addition to recording music, he has also presented three TEDx Talks, performed at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts and has been featured on America's Got Talent. His life story of transitioning from tragedy to triumph has been told on screen via the documentary Tower to Tower as well as in his memoir Be the Change. Most recently, SaulPaul founded Change Water, a socially conscious bottled water company that donates to the local community with each case of water sold. Whether via art, entrepreneurship or community service, SaulPaul is committed to #BeTheChange.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thecurrent #rockthecradle", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmIhFecXLms", "date_published": "2021-06-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Interview: Shirley Manson of Garbage", "description": "Ahead of their seventh studio album out June 11, 'No Gods No Masters,' Jill Riley caught up with @garbage frontwoman Shirley Manson about not holding back on the new record, starting a podcast, and the band's upcoming tour with @Alanis and @LizPhairOfficial.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCJ6scoYGF8", "date_published": "2021-06-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Joan Shelley - two songs at The Current (2015; 2017)", "description": "Four years ago, Joan Shelley visited our studio to play songs from her self-titled 2017 album.
