and hopefully be able to get more detailed information by age group

Looked for reasons to vaccinate

Nadhim Zahawi

We are on track for offering all over 50s who have had the first jab their second jab by June 21

Very high levels of uptake, in the 90%s

but we have got to make sure they get their second jab

5 or 6% who didn't have their jab, please come forward

21st June

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-june-21-lockdown-end-covid-vaccine-variant/

Jim McManus, vice-president of the Association of Directors of Public Health

Need an other 4 weeks

Data, and not dates

invest that little bit of time to keep us going forwards, it will stop us going backwards

The complete lifting of measures on the 21st of June not only risks an increase in cases and hospitalisation, 

but risks the introduction of new variants to the UK which will undermine our vaccination programme and derail our path back to normality
