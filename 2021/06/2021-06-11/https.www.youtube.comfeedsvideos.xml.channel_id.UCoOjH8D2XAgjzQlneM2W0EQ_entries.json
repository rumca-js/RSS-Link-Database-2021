He\u2019s the man behind the parent company that owns some of the biggest names in luxury: Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Hennessy, Tiffany & Co, Tag Heuer, Hublot, Sephora, and many more.\n\nThe world is ran by smart people. If you look at the totem pole of society, it\u2019s just smart people on top of smart people trying to convince other people to do what they want them to do. When you\u2019re poor, you are owned by smart people: like your boss. But then, some people are able to make it out of that poor phase into the freedom phase where you\u2019re making around $100k a year or more on your own. At this point, smart people can no longer get at you - but they still really want to because we're naturally power hungry creatures. So in order for smart people to convince successful people to do what they want them to do, you have to lure them in with something else. And that something else is luxury goods.\n\nBernard grew up as the son of a father that owned a manufacturing/civil engineering company in France. According to Bernard, his mom made two major contributions to his life: one, she made him take piano lessons and two, she had a fascination with the perfume and fashion brand Christian Dior. His father was the one that really gave him a sense of business, and by age 25, he took over the reigns of his dad\u2019s company, with the ambitions to start his own empire.\n\n-----------------------\n\nNo Spirit - Reliving https://chll.to/d61278d4 \n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
