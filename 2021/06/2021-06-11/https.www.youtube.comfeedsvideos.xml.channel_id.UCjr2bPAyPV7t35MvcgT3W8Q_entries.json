They need to pay out dividends and increase share prices, otherwise investors might bail. Serving customers neutrally is risky, because at least some of them might use their service in ways that produce really bad PR. \n\nPayPal\u2019s terms of service redefines what money means. Its narrow acceptable use policy makes money function as a permissioned tender. You cannot use your funds however you want. PayPal has a broad definition for which payments require pre-approval and which ones are not allowed at all. It isn\u2019t the only financial company susceptible to the failures of centralization, but it\u2019s a perfect case study for why you shouldn\u2019t trust any single authority when it comes to your money. \n\nSources\nPayPal sucks https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com\nPayPal's acceptable use policy https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full\n\nRidiculous examples of PayPal financial censorship\nTardigrade\nhttps://news.bitcoin.com/the-moss-piglet-dilemma-paypal-bans-payments-to-merchants-using-the-word-tardigrade/\nhttps://twitter.com/c/ArchieMcPhee/status/1304434532293046272\nhttps://www.geekwire.com/2020/weird-seattle-retailer-archie-mcphee-hit-even-weirder-paypal-security-glitch/\nhttps://twitter.com/princessmlokhia/status/1394399401263632384\nCancelled without explanation \nhttps://mises.org/power-market/paypal-censorship-not-limited-online-provocateurs\nhttps://puntofisso.medium.com/paypal-closed-my-account-with-no-explanation-it-could-happen-to-you-6ff0ba4ea95f\nhttps://twitter.com/Kimberleypfp/status/1304443884005740544\nCancelled for speech\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/09/paypal-proud-boys-antifa-ban-gavin-mcinnes-criticism\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/tech-companies-white-supremacists-stripe-paypal-square-anedot_n_5b71fd68e4b0ae32af9ae20e\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16159310/apple-pay-drops-support-white-supremacist-neo-nazi-merchandise\nhttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/blakemontgomery/the-alt-right-has-a-payment-processor-problem\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/paypal-and-shopify-remove-trump-related-accounts-citing-policies-against-supporting-violence/\nhttps://mashable.com/article/epik-domain-names-paypal-proud-boys/?\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/technology/parler-app-trump-free-speech.html\n\nScreening based on keywords\nhttps://thegrayzone.com/2020/01/09/paypal-blocks-donations-iran/\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/venmo-censorship-neutral-platforms-like-bitcoin \nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/venmo-blocking-palestine-relief-payments-us-treasury-sanctions-rules-2021-5\nhttps://twitter.com/SJPUIC/status/1394417124458827780\n\nCensoring publishers\nhttps://news.bitcoin.com/pornhub-accepts-bitcoin-top-adult-site-cryptocurrency-payment/\nhttps://www.wired.com/2010/12/paypal-wikileaks/\nhttps://www.thepaypalblog.com/2010/12/paypal-statement-regarding-wikileaks/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2010/12/07/visa-mastercard-move-to-choke-wikileaks/\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/blackballed-by-paypal-scientific-paper-pirate-takes-bitcoin-donations\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-department-investigates-sci-hub-founder-on-suspicion-of-working-for-russian-intelligence/2019/12/19/9dbcb6e6-2277-11ea-a153-dce4b94e4249_story.html\n\nPayPal under investigation https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-consumer-watchdog-agency-investigates-venmo-payments-app/2021/02/05/a869e7d6-67ad-11eb-886d-5264d4ceb46d_story.html\n\nPayPal's crypto lure\nhttps://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency\nhttps://blog.trezor.io/why-you-should-not-use-paypal-for-bitcoin-f6e2d436ca96?\n\nPayPal's compliance with government mandates\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32067151\nOFAC https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information\nhttps://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/Keeping-the-Venmo-Community-Secure-The-Companys-Approach-to-OFAC-Compliance\n\nPayPal's integration into China\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-paypal-stake-idUSKBN29J0IC\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/30/tech/paypal-gopay-china-payments/index.html\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/paypal-china/?\n\nCensorship by other centralized financial institutions\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/bank-of-america-will-stop_n_798605\nhttps://stripe.com/restricted-businesses\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\nhttps://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkOqvQeOecM", "date_published": "2021-06-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
