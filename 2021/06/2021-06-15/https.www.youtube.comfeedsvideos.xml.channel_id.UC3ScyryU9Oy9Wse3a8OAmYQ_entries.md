More than two years in the making, “Prison State” focuses on one troubled housing project in Louisville, Ky., where a large number of residents have been incarcerated. The film follows the lives of four individuals rotating between custody and freedom. Using deep access to the Louisville jail, the film focuses on the efforts of Mark Bolton, the city’s director of corrections, as he tries to move inmates back into the community.
