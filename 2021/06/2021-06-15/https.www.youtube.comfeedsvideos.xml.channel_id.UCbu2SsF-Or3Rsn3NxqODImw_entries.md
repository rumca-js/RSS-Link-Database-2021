Season 4 of Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War kicks off with several updates including the Red Door Event, new Zombies Map and Satellites coming to Warzone. Tune in to find out what weapons, operators, and maps will be added and when you can expect them.

Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War Season 4 is loaded with new maps, operators, weapons and more. Tune in as Richie breaks down the details of the latest season in just under 5 minutes. Call of Duty has a unique standing in the games industry with a mix of yearly premium AAA titles as well as their free-to-play battle royale, Warzone. This update has something for Cold War, Warzone and Zombies players. Here’s what's new.

Warzone is getting some new points of interests with some satellite crash sites surrounding the all new “Groundfall” event. Thanks to Stitch’s mercenary friend Jackal, some CIA satellites have been sent out of orbit and have crash landed onto Verdansk. In Groundfall, completing challenges surrounding the crash sites will earn players XP, weapon charms and a chance at an exclusive blueprint upon completing all challenges. Some changes coming to Cold War’s multiplayer include new maps like the returning “Hijacked” map from BO2 as well as new weapons both at launch and throughout the season. These include the Mace melee weapon, MG82 Light machine gun, OTs 9 Submachinegun and the C58 Assault rifle.

Lastly, big changes are coming to zombies mode. Later in the season, we’ll be seeing an all new round-based zombies map. This will continue the story between requiem and omega forces and will take place in east Berlin. Before that, Outbreak mode will get a new Zoo area to explore and complete missions. Grigori Weaver from Requiem and Black Ops 1 will also be available as a playable operator later in the season. Until then, keep it tuned to GameSpot for the latest COD news and gameplay.

## Zelda: Breath Of The Wild Sequel Trailer Breakdown | E3 2021

After two years, we've finally received a brand new trailer for Breath of the Wild 2 on Nintendo Switch, so Max Blumenthal (RinHara5aki) and Evan Langer are back to dissect everything shown.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was released four years ago on March 3, 2017, and was a launch title for the Nintendo Switch. At E3 2019, we got our first glimpse of the sequel where Link and Zelda investigate a cave and find what appears to be the corpse of Ganondorf. Two years later, we finally received a new look at the sequel during the E3 2021 Nintendo Direct.

In the new trailer, we learn that the game takes place on the surface world of Breath of the Wild--and in the sky. During the sky section, we see Link with his hair down, and he also sports some strange new abilities in his arm, including the ability to rewind time. Link also seems to be able to travel between the sky and surface; however, the trailer showcases Link with his original haircut in the surface sections, so we aren’t entirely sure how they connect or whether each segment takes place at different points in time.

The Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will be released exclusively for Nintendo Switch in 2022. Despite rumors of a Switch Pro on the way, Nintendo announced nothing of the sort at the Direct, so we’ll have to wait and see if Breath of the Wild 2 utilizes this rumored hardware upgrade. If you want to watch us analyze the E3 2019 trailer, be sure to check out our previous Breath of the Wild 2 trailer breakdown: https://youtu.be/3DRARZQexW4
