Many people have accused Tether of being fraudulent, but until now, the story has been told in pieces. Today I'm trying to tell a comprehensive story of tether. \nI hope you enjoy. \n\nFollow Coffeezilla\n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/coffeebreak_yt/\n\ud83c\udfb6 Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMSQ1yoPT2c&list=PL4qw3AkxFDSNhEgawXD1j6r0iN1072XIB&index=1\nThis video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact.
