A short history of the world's most controversial cryptocurrency: Tether
Tether is a stablecoin cryptocurrency with tokens issued by Tether Limited, which in turn is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. Many people have accused Tether of being fraudulent, but until now, the story has been told in pieces. Today I'm trying to tell a comprehensive story of tether. 
I hope you enjoy.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
