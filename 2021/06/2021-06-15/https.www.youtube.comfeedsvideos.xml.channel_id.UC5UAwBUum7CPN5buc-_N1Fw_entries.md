Another day, another desktop environment, as Cutefish sees the light of Day. Cutefish, which is the default on Cutefish OS, a new distro, seems to blend a GNOME like look with more Mac OS inspired elements. It's based on Qt5, Plasma, and the KDE Frameworks.

The date for windows 10 end of life has been announced, as October 14 2025. This means that Windows 10 only has 4 more years to live, and Microsoft is primed to release its successor soon. Now why am I talking about this here? because there have been rumors everywhere that Windows would switch to the Linux kernel for their nextt release, so we'll soon see that it's definitely not the case, on June 24, when Microsoft announces the new release.
I'm willing to bet that this new release won't be based on Linux. If I'm wrong, I'm creating an OnlyFans account.
