Ten years ago this week, Bob Mould visited the Forum at MPR for a session hosted by Mary Lucia and recorded before a live audience. Not only did Bob Mould turn his amp all the way up to play some songs, he also talked about and read from his autobiography, "See a Little Light: The Trail of Rage and Melody," which was released that same week; specifically, on June 15, 2011.

Watch two songs by Bob Mould recorded on that day in 2011; you'll also hear Mould read an excerpt from his book before he breaks into the song, "Lonely Afternoon."

Bob Mould and his band will perform at the First Avenue Mainroom in Minneapolis on Saturday, Sept. 25, 2021.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Something I Learned Today"
2:00 "Lonely Afternoon" (preceded by brief book excerpt)

## Ásgeir - two performances for The Current (2014, 2017)

Seven years ago today — on June 14, 2014 — Ásgeir performed in The Current studio. The Icelandic artist, whose full name is Ásgeir Trausti Einarsson, olds the record for the highest-charting debut album in Icelandic history, where 1 in 10 people own a copy. He's been called the Icelandic Jeff Buckley, the Icelandic Bon Iver, yet the easygoing singer-songwriter remains bemused by all the accolades. While he was on tour in support of his album "In the Silence" in 2014, Ásgeir and his band visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Bill DeVille.

We reconnected with Ásgeir three years later, at Iceland Airwaves 2017, when he visited the Götubarinn pub in Akureyri, the second city of the Iceland Airwaves Music Festival, where Mark Wheat welcomed him for a live session. The second song you'll see above, "Stardust," an original by Ásgeir, comes from that performance.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "King and Cross" (2014)
3:32 "Stardust" (2017)
