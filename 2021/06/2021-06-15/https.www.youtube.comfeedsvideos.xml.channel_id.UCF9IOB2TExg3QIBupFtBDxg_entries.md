Well at the moment we're not seeing any evidence, that I'm aware of, of any loss of protection over time

But we don't know yet whether boosters will be needed or not

We also have a virus that's circulating which will cause some mild disease in those who've had two doses, 

and that will actually boost their immunity as well

So we're actually in quite a good place at the moment, 

we're not seeing any failure over time, waning of that protection

I don't think we have the evidence to predict the dates

Dr Tedros

This is a big help, but we need more, and we need them faster. 

Right now, the virus is moving faster than the global distribution of vaccines.

11 billion doses, 70% of people in low-income countries by 2022

Cases will rise

Prof Graham Medley

London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, disease modelling

Government risks are primarily based upon the healthcare, and whether the healthcare can continue to function.

Could return to seeing hundreds of deaths each day?

I think that's quite possible it's not a certainty. 

There is a lot of uncertainty, but I think that's quite possible

It’s incredibly important that staff in care homes are vaccinated. 

We have got a hugely vulnerable population in our care homes and making sure that staff are vaccinated is a priority.

Vaccinations for children

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-covid-lockdown-rules-second-vaccine-cases/

Professor Calum Semple, (SAGE member)

We're talking about vaccinating children here mainly to protect public health and reduce transmission, 

Teenagers, biologically more like adults (for transmission)

But the younger children really are not, they're about a half to a third as likely to acquire the virus. 

Spare vaccines should be sent to countries who do not have enough doses

I'm veering on the not vaccinating children

China vaccine rollout

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-covid-lockdown-rules-second-vaccine-cases/

First dose, 44%

April, 4.8 million doses per day

June, 17.3 million doses per day

Yesterday, 19.8 million

Total doses, 923 million

Beijing and Shanghai, majority fully vaccinated

Correct technique in China

Recombinant nanoparticle protein-based COVID-19 vaccine

Soapbark tree

Influenza and HPV

Fridge, 2 doses, 3 week gap

Placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized 2:1

100% protection against moderate and severe disease

All hospitalizations and deaths in placebo group

90.4% efficacy overall

91% efficacy in high-risk populations

(over 65 or comorbidities)

N = 29,960, 119 sites, U.S. and Mexico

File for regulatory authorizations in the third quarter

100 million doses per month, then 150 million per month by end of 2021

UK, with GlaxoSmithKline, 60 million doses, Barnard Castle

Results: Consistent, high efficacy among circulating variants

77 infections

Placebo group, 63

Ten moderate cases and four severe

Vaccine group, 14 in the vaccine group

All cases observed in the vaccine group were mild

January 25 through April 30, 2021

Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant, became the predominant strain in the U.S

100% efficacy against variants not considered VoC/Vo

Favorable safety profile

Generally well-tolerated

Serious and severe adverse events few, balanced between vaccine and placebo groups

Injection site pain and tenderness, generally mild to moderate, lasting less than 3 days

Fatigue, headache and muscle pain, lasting less than 2 days

Favorable outcome on viral load and culture viability using Ivermectin in early treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild COVID-19 – A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial

Sheba Medical Center, and Tel Aviv University

Ivermectin is an FDA-approved broad spectrum anti-parasitic agent

Initially approved in humans in 1987

Nobel prize of Medicine in 2015

With its high safety profile, ivermectin is a potential treatment against COVID-19 in its different stages.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.31.21258081v1

To assess whether ivermectin can shorten the viral shedding in patients at an early-stage of COVID-19 infection

Double blinded randomized control trial

Patients receiving ivermectin 0·2 mg/kg for 3 days vs placebo

Non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients

RT-PCR, recruitment and then every two days

Primary endpoint was reduction of viral-load on the 6th day

As reflected by Ct level more than 30 (non-infectious level)

Primary outcome was supported by determination of viral culture viability

Results

N = 89

Ivermectin group, 47 

Placebo group, 42

Females, 21·6%

Asymptomatic at recruitment, 16.8%

Symptomatic, 83%

On day 6

Ivermectin group

34 out of 47 (72%) reached the endpoint, (non-infectious level)

Placebo group

21 out of 42 (50%) reached the endpoint, (non-infectious level)

Odds of a negative test at day 6 was 2.62 time higher in the ivermectin group

Also

Ivermectin group, cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 3/23 (13·0%)

Placebo group, cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 14/29 (48·2%)

(p=0·008)

3 hospitalisations, 3 in the placebo group

Diarrhoea, 2 and 1

No other adverse effects were reported

Conclusions

There were significantly lower viral loads and viable cultures in the ivermectin group, which could lead to shortening isolation time in these patients.
