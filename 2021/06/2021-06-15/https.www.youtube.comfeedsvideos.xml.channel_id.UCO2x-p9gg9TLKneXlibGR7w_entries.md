#ad What really is the future of autonomously driven vehicles? Are they ever coming? Turns out, they're here (with caveats)! We sit down with Waymo and talk about how impressively manufactured hardware, scene perception, behavior prediction, and simulation have made Waymo the leader in autonomous driving technology, and the potential pitfalls that come from other methods of autonomy. Waymo products may not be in your life right now, but they will be one day and it's important to understand how redundancy and confidence increase safety with humans and machines on our roadways.
