The Icelandic artist, whose full name is \u00c1sgeir Trausti Einarsson, olds the record for the highest-charting debut album in Icelandic history, where 1 in 10 people own a copy. He's been called the Icelandic Jeff Buckley, the Icelandic Bon Iver, yet the easygoing singer-songwriter remains bemused by all the accolades. While he was on tour in support of his album \"In the Silence\" in 2014, \u00c1sgeir and his band visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Bill DeVille.\n\nWe reconnected with \u00c1sgeir three years later, at Iceland Airwaves 2017, when he visited the G\u00f6tubarinn pub in Akureyri, the second city of the Iceland Airwaves Music Festival, where Mark Wheat welcomed him for a live session. The second song you'll see above, \"Stardust,\" an original by \u00c1sgeir, comes from that performance.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"King and Cross\" (2014)\n3:32 \"Stardust\" (2017)\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Leah Garaas; Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Wesley Berger; Erik Stromstad\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; Jim McGuinn\n\nFIND MORE:\n2014 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/06/14/asgeir-performs-in-the-current-studios\n2017 Iceland Airwaves session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/11/03/watch-asgeir-performing-at-iceland-airwaves\n2018 Iceland Airwaves session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/11/09/asgeir-performs-two-new-songs-at-iceland-airwaves\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#asgeir #thecurrent #iceland", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tyAfA7xtBo", "date_published": "2021-06-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
