of, of any loss of protection over time\n\nBut we don't know yet whether boosters will be needed or not\n\nWe also have a virus that's circulating which will cause some mild disease in those who've had two doses, \n\nand that will actually boost their immunity as well\n\nSo we're actually in quite a good place at the moment, \n\nwe're not seeing any failure over time, waning of that

about a half to a third as likely to acquire the virus. \n\nSpare vaccines should be sent to countries who do not have enough doses\n\nI'm veering on the not vaccinating children\n\nChina vaccine
