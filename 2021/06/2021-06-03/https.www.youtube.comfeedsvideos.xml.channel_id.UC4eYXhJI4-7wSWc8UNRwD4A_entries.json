Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nLyndsey McKenna | June 3, 2021\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen a Hold Steady show, then you know it\u2019s an experience, complete with communal singalongs and confetti. But for its first-ever full-band Tiny Desk appearance, the group squeezed behind a cramped backstage corner of the Brooklyn Bowl, COVID mask protocol in place (\u201cUnusual times, unusual measures,\u201d Craig Finn explains). \n\nIlluminated by string lights, the band ran through tracks from its latest album, Open Door Policy, kicking off with \u201cHeavy Covenant\u201d as a swell of clarinets and trumpets round out the sound (\u201cThe Horn Steady,\u201d as Finn tells it). Though the lineup consisted of its current supersized iteration \u2013 featuring both Steve Selvidge on guitar and multi-instrumentalist Franz Nicolay back on accordion \u2013 the band scaled back its swagger for the space. Here, the recurring \u201cWoos!\u201d on the recorded version of \u201cUnpleasant Breakfast\u201d become softer and more subtle; the surf sounds of \u201cRiptown\u201d still rolick, but with restraint that suits the setting.\n\nEven after eight studio albums and nearly two decades, it\u2019s surreal to think that any band can still have the capacity to surprise. But to this fan\u2019s ears, Open Door Policy upends expectations and redefines what The Hold Steady sound can be. And even in a compact \u2013 and crowdless \u2013 setting, there\u2019s still so much joy to be found in what The Hold Steady has built for almost 20 summers. \n\nSET LIST\n\"Heavy Covenant\"\n\"Unpleasant Breakfast\"\n\"Riptown\"\n\"Parade Days\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBobby Drake: drums\nCraig Finn: vocals\nTad Kubler: guitar, vocals\nFranz Nicolay: keyboards, accordion, vocals\nGalen Polivka: bass\nStephen Selvidge: guitar, vocals\nStuart Bogie: clarinet\nPeter Hess: clarinet\nJordan McLean: trumpet\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Jonathan Healey, Clint Tuccio\nAudio: Scott Adamson, Jonathan Silverman\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Gabrielle Pierre\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #theholdsteady", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0S-FysDePE", "date_published": "2021-06-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
