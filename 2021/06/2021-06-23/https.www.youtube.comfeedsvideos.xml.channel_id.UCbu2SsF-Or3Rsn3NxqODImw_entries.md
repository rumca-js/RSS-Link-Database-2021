In 2020 GameSpot held Play For All, a multi-week event that encompassed covering the latest game reveals and announcements, but also involved a charity effort to raise money for causes that were important to us. We’re super excited about Play For All 2021 and have been working hard to put together something that you’ll have a blast watching. 

This year we’ll be fundraising for AbleGamers to help its mission to enable play for everyone, in order to combat social isolation, foster inclusivity in the gaming community, and help provide specialized gaming equipment to those who need it. To find out more, head over to ablegamers.org.

## Mario Golf: Super Rush Video Review

Mario Golf: Super Rush is a fast-paced spin on the relaxing sport that oozes excitement.

When Mario Golf: Super Rush is at its best, chaos is what makes it tick. These unpredictable moments are hilarious, adding a new dimension to Camelot’s long-running sports series. Zany courses designed to look more like 3D Super Mario levels and a pair of new fast-paced modes turn the typically leisurely sport of golf into an action game. But for all of the exciting moments and innovation Mario Golf: Super Rush offers, it still feels slim on content and lackluster at times.
