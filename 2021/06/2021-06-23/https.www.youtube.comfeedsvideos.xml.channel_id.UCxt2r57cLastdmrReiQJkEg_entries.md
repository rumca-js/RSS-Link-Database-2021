In this month's video, we're exploring the origins of countries. What is a country? What was the first country? And how did the particular model of country which dominates in the present day, the nation-state, come to be so widely accepted as the organising principle for human politics and governance?

We're going to be taking a deep dive into the scholarship on states, nations and nationalism from the earliest states in Mesopotamia and Xin Dynasty China, through the emergence of the imagined community of the nation following the French Revolution and the American War of Independence during the 19th century and into the present day.
