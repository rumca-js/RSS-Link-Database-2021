Faze ü§ù  Ricegum ü§ù Sommer Ray -- crypto scams called Save The Kids
savethekids.io was a disaster and after promoting it as "ambassadors" during the prelaunch... they quickly abandoned the project. Why did FaZe Clan members even promote this?
UPDATE SomeordinaryGamers also talked about it recently here: 
FaZe Clan and Ricegum Should Be Investigated By The Feds...

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
