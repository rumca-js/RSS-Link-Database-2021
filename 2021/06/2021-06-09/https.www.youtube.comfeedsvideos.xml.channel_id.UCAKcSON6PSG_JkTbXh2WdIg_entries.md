## First Aid Kit - three live performances (2018)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks4kw9tyirs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks4kw9tyirs)
 - RSS feed: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg

Seven years ago this week, Swedish band First Aid Kit performed in our studio. A little more than three years ago — in January 2018 — they performed a concert at the Palace Theatre in St. Paul, Minn., from which these performances come. With head-banging, strobe lights, and electric guitar solos, First Aid Kit brought a new energy to the Palace.

Sisters Johanna and Klara Söderberg had just released their fourth album, "Ruins." The album features songs that fit the texture we’ve come to expect from First Aid Kit — folksy sounds with beautiful harmonies — as well as expanding the group’s palette to include a harder-rocking sound and sharper edge. 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Fireworks"
4:14 "The Lion's Roar"
9:53 "You Are The Problem"

PERSONNEL
Klara Söderberg – vocals, guitar
Johanna Söderberg – vocals, bass
Melvin Duffy – pedal steel guitar, mandolin and electric guitar
Scott Simpson – drums 
Steve Moore – keyboards, trombone

## Listen to Looch: 'Cracked Up' is Darrell Hammond's survival story
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_X1KOUdFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_X1KOUdFI)
 - RSS feed: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg

Mary Lucia talks about the documentary called "Cracked Up: The Darrell Hammond Story." If you need a quick refresher, Darrell Hammond is an actor, comedian and impressionist who was the longest-serving cast member on "Saturday Night Live" until Kenan Thompson ascended to that title.

"Darrell Hammond was known for his impressions of people like Bill Clinton and Sean Connery," Mary says. "He was a man of so many voices — and it just goes to show what you don't know about someone. Cracked Up is an incredible story about Hammond's childhood and trauma. And the fact that he was as high performing as he was, in some ways, makes a lot of sense. In fact, he was a shapeshifter; Whoopi Goldberg calls him a shapeshifter because I think, as people and children of trauma, there's almost a need to create someone else to deal with certain things, which is kind of what he did through some of the characters. But this film is so much deeper than that. ... I won't tell you everything. A lot of it is very heartbreaking. He truly got through it with humor, and talent, but also there's so many visible scars."

"Cracked Up" is directed by Michelle Esrick and it's available for streaming on Netflix.
