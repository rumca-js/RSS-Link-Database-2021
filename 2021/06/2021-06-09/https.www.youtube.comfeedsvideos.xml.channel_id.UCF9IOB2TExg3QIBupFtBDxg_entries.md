UK, Delta variant, 91%

CoViD symptom study

https://covid.joinzoe.com

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHBua3aXQ7c&t=403s

R = 1.3 (UK)

Delta, R = 6 (in no lockdown conditions)

Two doses needed

Young and unvaccinated

Cases could double in the next week, up to 20,000 per day

Increased cases will feed through into more deaths, 40 per day

Long CoViD will also increase

Change in presentation

Cold like features

Symptoms now (since May)

Headache

Sore throt

Runny nose

Fever

Cough

No loss of smell anymore

The four tests

The vaccine deployment programme continues successfully

Evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated

Infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS

The assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern.

The world needs this meeting

We must be honest: International order and solidarity were badly shaken by Covid. 

Nations were reduced to beggar-my-neighbor tactics in the desperate search for P.P.E., for drugs — and, finally, for vaccines

put those days behind us

This is the moment for the world’s greatest and most technologically advanced democracies to shoulder their responsibilities and to vaccinate the world, 

because no one can be properly protected until everyone has been protected

President Biden

Buying 500 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech
