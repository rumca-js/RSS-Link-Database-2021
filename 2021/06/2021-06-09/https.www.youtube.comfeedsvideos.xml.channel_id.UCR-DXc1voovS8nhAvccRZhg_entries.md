I've built a few Raspberry Pi NASes in my day, but none were *this* nice.

The Wiretrustee SATA is listed on Crowd Supply and will allow you to plug in a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 and up to four SATA hard drives or SSDs to build your own gigabit NAS.

**UPDATE**: I just heard Wiretrustee is postponing production of this board for now due to component shortages and huge price spikes for some of the most important parts :(

They still have an open source repository (https://github.com/wiretrustee/cm4-sata-board) with designs for some of the parts like the enclosure and heatsink, and I'm really hoping they'll be able to get production up and running soon, because this is such a neat board!
