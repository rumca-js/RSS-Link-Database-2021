Lyrics:
(Hey) 
You took my money away
You said that it was safe but I'm rugged and I don't feel okay
I trusted you, you said that it was alright
But now I'm broke, and my wallet's real light

Pancakeswap sushiswap uniswap, I ain't got no eth
I got greedy now my friend's make fun of me
Those altcoins I thought were clean, are now dirty
They promise you the moon but I burned up in re-entry

(Oh Hey)
You took my money away
You said that it was safe but I'm rugged and I don't feel okay
I trusted you, you said that it was alright
But now I'm broke, and my wallet's real light

Telegram, discord, twitter communities
Devs have been gone for three years but the boys they ain't sellin

buy the dip 
buy the dip 
buy the dip 
buy the dip 
I bought the dip
I bought the dip
I bought the dip
Wait--no-----It was the top

(Oh Hey)
You took my money away
You said that it was safe but I'm rugged and I don't feel okay
I trusted you, you said that it was alright
But now I'm broke, and my wallet's real light

## The REAL Story Behind ANOM:

The criminal underworld will never be the same again. The ANOM sting operation (Operation Trojan Shield in the US or Operation Ironside in AU) was a collaboration by several countries, from 2018 and 2021. The idea was to use so called "Privacy Phones" to break into the criminal syndicates to disrupt their plots.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
