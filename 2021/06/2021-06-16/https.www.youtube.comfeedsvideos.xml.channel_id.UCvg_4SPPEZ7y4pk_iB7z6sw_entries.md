E3 is done, its over. So now, I’m gonna describe the things that happened. The shorts aren’t gone or anything like that, this was just…special circumstances.

So this is like a long, uh, short video. A medium length video, if you will.

I’ll have two more videos talking about the Switch Pro and Halo Infinite Release Date in a few days. Just figured it would be too long otherwise.
