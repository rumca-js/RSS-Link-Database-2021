Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nNikki Birch | June 17, 2021\nThe studio backdrop of this Tiny Desk (home) concert is the perfect setting for the dynamic duo headlining this project. Pino Palladino is a prolific bassist whose sound you're\u00a0already intimately acquainted with\u00a0(even if you don't know it). Blake Mills, a guitarist and two-time Grammy nominee for producer of the year, has an impressive catalog of his own. Together, in the studio, the topshelf sidemen are in their element, distilling the sonic creativity that is the first release under Palladino's name,\u00a0Notes With Attachments.\n\nEight pulsing calls from saxophonist Sam Gendel usher us into\u00a0\"Just Wrong\"\u00a0a melodic meditation that unfolds like a blossom in timelapse. Guitar, bass, sax and Abe Rounds' colorful dustings of percussion in this song are magical; we soar with the musicians through varied repetitions of the melody before they gently set us back on our feet. The afterimage of our flight is still fading away when Palladino greets the viewers with a short and sweet introduction before opening \"Ekut\u00e9,\" a tune that explores traditional West African music, jazz and rock influences with a few modern touches of technology. \"Djurkel,\" the final offering in this set, is also experimental in nature. Palladino's trademark bass sound lies in the cut, the fertile ground on which Mills, Gendel and Rounds dance dreamily around each other. This is session musicianship at its best. Each watch reveals new depths to the mastery.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Just Wrong\"\n \u2022 \"Ekut\u00e9\"\n \u2022 \"Djurkel\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Pino Palladino: bass\n \u2022 Blake Mills: guitar\n \u2022 Abe Rounds: percussion\n \u2022 Sam Gendel: saxophone\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Jason Tippet, Carl McLaughlin, Julian Chavez\n \u2022 Audio: Joseph Lorge\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Nikki Birch\n \u2022 Video Producer: Kara Frame\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Andy Huether\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Maia Stern, Josh Rogosin, Gabrielle Pierre\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #pinopalladino #blakemills #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-V77_moZYw", "date_published": "2021-06-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Men I Trust: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | June 16, 2021\nFrom a rustic and retro-looking cabin on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, the band Men I Trust seized the essence of the Tiny Desk almost to a tee. The controlled, yet layered four-song set, bookended by tracks from 2019's Oncle Jazz would almost certainly make for a plug-and-play situation had it been behind Bob Boilen's desk.\n\nMen I Trust was initially the duo of high school friends Dragos Chiriac and Jessy Caron, before adding vocalist Emma Proulx in 2015 and recording the group's debut album, Headroom. (They expanded to a quintet for this performance, with Cedric Martel handling bass and Eric Maillet on drums.) The song \"Humming Man,\" performed here, was its first official single as a trio and they never looked back from there. The band's style sways between rubbery upbeat electro-pop and the muddy pace evident on last year's \"Lucky Sue,\" but generally hits that sweet spot for anybody looking to be cradled and carried by a vibe-y groove. The overdubs and reverb on Emma's vocals are stripped away here, leaving a deceptively endearing quality to her voice. The band told NPR that this set was one of its first times playing together after a long hiatus due to the COVID-19 lockdown. \"We reunited at the cabin, jammed and recorded our session,\" the members said via email. \"We strived to capture the intimacy and coziness on sound and image. We hope you'll enjoy it!\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Show Me How\"\n\"Lucky Sue\"\n\"Humming Man\"\n\"All Night\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nEmma Proulx: vocals, guitar\nJessy Caron: guitar\nDragos Chiriac: keyboard\nCedric Martel: bass\nEric Maillet: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo and Audio: Men I Trust\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Gabrielle Pierre\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #menitrust", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp7qctyVU2s", "date_published": "2021-06-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
