Cutefish, which is the default on Cutefish OS, a new distro, seems to blend a GNOME like look with more Mac OS inspired elements. It's based on Qt5, Plasma, and the KDE Frameworks.\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/06/cutefish-new-linux-desktop-environment\n\nUbuntu announced Ubuntu Pro for Google Cloud, an Ubuntu server ISO with a host of services that runs on Google's cloud.\nhttps://ubuntu.com//blog/introducing-ubuntu-pro-for-google-cloud\n\n\nWIne 6.10 was released\nhttps://www.winehq.org/announce/6.10\n\n\nSpeaking of Wine, it looks like the day is close, where it will run windows apps on wayland without the need to run an Xserver inside of Wayland, what is called XWayland.\nhttps://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/collabora-continue-enhancing-wine-for-wayland-now-with-vulkan-and-multi-monitor-support\n\nAnd yet another smooth segway here, as the Nvidia drivers are moving to better support VR games on Linux. \nhttps://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/nvidia-driver-470-for-linux-to-include-support-for-async-reprojection\n\n\nSlimbook has released their Slimbook AMD Ryzen controller, a simple app that lets you tweak the power profile of your AMD Ryzen CPU. \nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/06/amd-ryzen-ubuntu-user-check-out-this-new-app-from-slimbook\n\nSomething that just didn't make the cut for the last video: Firefox got its new redesign, accompanied with the usual controversy that seems to follow each change of look for any application. \nhttps://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/fresh-new-look-for-firefox/\n\n\nOBS, the broadcast tool, now supports Wayland on Linux, which is pretty cool, and that includes support for Pipewire, the tool that promises an end to audio nightmares on Linux. https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/06/linux-release-roundup-pop-os-21-04-beta-obs-ardour\n\nThe date for windows 10 end of life has been announced, as October 14 2025. This means that Windows 10 only has 4 more years to live, and Microsoft is primed to release its successor soon. Now why am I talking about this here? because there have been rumors everywhere that Windows would switch to the Linux kernel for their nextt release, so we'll soon see that it's definitely not the case, on June 24, when Microsoft announces the new release.\nI'm willing to bet that this new release won't be based on Linux. If I'm wrong, I'm creating an OnlyFans account. \nhttps://thenextweb.com/news/windows-10-support-ending-2025\n\nLooks like a lot of windows users are seeing pop-up warnings telling them that window \"recommends\" different browser and search engine settings.\nhttps://tech.slashdot.org/story/21/06/06/2139224/windows-10-notifies-users-they-should-make-bing-their-browsers-default-search-engine\n\nGoogle will finally stop making other search engines pay for the right to be selectable by users on Android. \nhttps://www.engadget.com/google-android-choice-screen-europe-default-search-engine-auction-173936666.html\n\nLooks like the Irish police will now have the right to compel the people of Ireland to give up their digital passwords when they're investigating you with a warrant.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57468750", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TurnINAeNmc", "date_published": "2021-06-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
