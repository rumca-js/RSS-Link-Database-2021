They stream every Friday on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/basementstate\n\nDeluge is driving here, playing samples, and sending 4 channels of MIDI to Hermod, which translates it to CV / Gate. Noise Engineering Manis Iteritas, Qu-Bit Surface, Mutable Instrument Rings, and Qu-Bit Chord are all sequenced on the fly through the Deluge and pass through the Tip-Top z5000, Make Noise Mimeophon, Qu-Bit Data Bender, and Happy Nerding FX AID.\n\nThe Deluge output and modular output are piped into the Elektron Octatrack where they are resampled and chopped and played back in fun slices.\n\nThis is an incredibly flexible system and is a lot of fun to play!\n\nSynthstrom Deluge: https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/\nQu-Bit Chord: https://bit.ly/2RD22ew\nQu-Bit Data Bender: http://bit.ly/pc_data_bender\nQu-Bit Surface: http://bit.ly/pc_surface\nMultable Instruments Rings: http://bit.ly/pc_rings\nHappy Nerding FX Aid XL: http://www.happynerding.com/category/fx-aid/\nTip-Top Z5000: http://bit.ly/pc_z5000\nMake Noise Mimeophon: https://bit.ly/3yYFyW5\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching. My name is Jeremy, and this is Red Means Recording. I've been making music for a few decades now, and this channel is a place to make music and to talk about the tools and techniques to make music with. We'll use synths, drum machines, modular gear, and software. \n\nIf you'd like to support the channel, I have a Patreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nI have music as \"Jeremy Blake\" on all the major services: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nI have some merch here: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nAnd you can connect with me here: \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTSvsyYVGg4", "date_published": "2021-06-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
