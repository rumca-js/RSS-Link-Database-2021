My set for the Seattle-based electronic music facilitators, Basement State. They stream every Friday on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/basementstate

Deluge is driving here, playing samples, and sending 4 channels of MIDI to Hermod, which translates it to CV / Gate. Noise Engineering Manis Iteritas, Qu-Bit Surface, Mutable Instrument Rings, and Qu-Bit Chord are all sequenced on the fly through the Deluge and pass through the Tip-Top z5000, Make Noise Mimeophon, Qu-Bit Data Bender, and Happy Nerding FX AID.

The Deluge output and modular output are piped into the Elektron Octatrack where they are resampled and chopped and played back in fun slices.

This is an incredibly flexible system and is a lot of fun to play!
