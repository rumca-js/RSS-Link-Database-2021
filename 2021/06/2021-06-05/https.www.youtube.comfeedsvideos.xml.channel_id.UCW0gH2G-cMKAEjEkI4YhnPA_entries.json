We will also cover how each type of orc was created - from the very first orcs corrupted by Melkor, to the Uruk-hai of Sauron and Saruman, to the half-orcs and goblin-men created at Isengard.\n\n*Hit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings!*  \n\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
