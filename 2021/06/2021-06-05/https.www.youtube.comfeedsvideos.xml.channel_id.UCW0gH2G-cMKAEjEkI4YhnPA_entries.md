Today we cover all the different variations of orc and what makes them unique - Uruk-hai, Goblin-men, Half-orcs, Snaga, Snifflers, and any other type of orc you can think of!  We will also cover how each type of orc was created - from the very first orcs corrupted by Melkor, to the Uruk-hai of Sauron and Saruman, to the half-orcs and goblin-men created at Isengard.
