To celebrate the announcement of the new animated film The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, we take a look at this time period in Middle-earth, as this mighty king faces grave enemies both outside Rohan, and from within.  We follow his life from his birth to taking refuge in the very gorge that would one day bear his name - Helm's Deep.\n\n*Hit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings!*  \n\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
