Live music has been on pause since March 2020. As venues and audiences start to return to shows, what is the state of Minnesota’s live music economy? 

In the first episode of LineCheck, The Current's virtual conversation series, Kristin Schwab of @marketplaceAPM interviewed venue operators Sophia Eris (Aunties), Ashley Ryan (First Avenue), and Molly Maher (freelance). Each operator talked about their experiences during the shutdown and their preparations for the challenges and opportunities ahead.

To open and close the evening, Charlie Parr performed "817 Oakland Avenue" and "Last Of The Better Days Ahead" from Sacred Heart Music Center in Duluth.
