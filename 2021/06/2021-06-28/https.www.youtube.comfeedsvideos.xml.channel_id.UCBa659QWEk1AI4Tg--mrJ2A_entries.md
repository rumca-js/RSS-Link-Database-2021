What do you do with a disused phone box? And can they help save lives? • Thanks to the Community Heartbeat Trust: https://www.communityheartbeat.org.uk/ • and the East of England Ambulance Service: https://www.eastamb.nhs.uk/

Automated external defibrillators, or AEDs, help save lives: but they need to be in an obvious, easy-to-access, public place that's protected from the elements. Conveniently, it turns out there's a disused red telephone box sitting in the middle of a lot of British villages...

BONUS SECRET LINK: I'm rolling out a weekly email newsletter. It goes out on Mondays at the same time as I publish here: it's got a link to the week's new video, plus interesting links I've found over the week, and occasionally behind-the-scenes stuff or secret projects. If that's for you, have a look here: https://www.tomscott.com/newsletter/

(If you tried to sign up to this a few weeks ago and never got a message about it: there were technical troubles. That's why the rollout is slow and experimental! Try again, it should work now.)
