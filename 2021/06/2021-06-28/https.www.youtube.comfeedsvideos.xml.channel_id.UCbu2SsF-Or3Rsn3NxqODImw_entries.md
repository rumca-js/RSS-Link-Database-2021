This video features a mix of gameplay from the original Mass Effect trilogy and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition.

The Pirates of the Caribbean tie-in content for Sea of Thieves offers a whole lot to do, and while it can be buggy and a bit frustrating, it's still pretty fun.

Tying in with Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise, the expansion provides new stories to uncover that are both fairly delightful for fans of the films and the theme park attraction that spawned them, as well as big, involved new Sea of Thieves locations to explore.

Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life is now available. You can read the full written Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life review by Phil Hornshaw on GameSpot: https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sea-of-thieves-a-pirates-life-review-dead-men-tell-five-tales-actually/1900-6417693/
