The instructors humbly maintain that they are students themselves, dedicated to improving their dance so that they can share more with others. They take their art and their jobs very seriously and appreciate everyone who entrusts their learning with them.\n\nKoo Koo Kanga Roo is a dance party of the senses. For the last 12 years, lifelong friends and collaborators Bryan and Neil have toured the globe delighting fans with their high-energy music, infectious positivity, and interactive live show. Of course, the global pandemic of 2020 threatened to put an end to the carefree fun that had come to define the band, but instead of putting the group on pause or looking for office jobs, Bryan and Neil doubled down and created their most triumphant and expansive album yet.\n\nSiama's Congo Roots \u2014 Back in Africa, Siama Matuzungidi recorded hundreds of songs and toured the world with popular artists. Now based in Minneapolis, he's known for his catchy songs, rhythmic guitar, spirited singing and traditional instruments like mbira, balafon and lokole. His wife and musical partner, Dallas Johnson, plays shakers and encourages everyone to sing along in Lingala, Kikongo and English as they bring Siama's rural childhood to life. They've earned World Music Pedagogy certificates from Smithsonian Folkways, and they're Teaching Musicians for COMPAS, Classical MPR's 'Class Notes' and the Schubert Club. Their children's album, \"Land of Yangalele\" received a Parents' Choice Parent-Approved award.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thecurrent #rockthecradle", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTgLH8anf4s", "date_published": "2021-06-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
