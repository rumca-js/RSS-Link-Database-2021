In this video, we'll explore the Modal Cobalt 8M extended virtual-analog synthesizer,  a unique and easy-to-use 8 voice synthesizer with a large selection of algorithms for each oscillator, offering a wide variety of tones without much fuss.

In this video, we'll see how it works, how it sounds, and make a track using patches we make from scratch!
