We reconstruct some of the scenes around Ganondorf's awakening, theorize what happens with the Master Sword, and examine details you might have missed about the Zonai's involvement.\n\nWe mention other important things, such as influences from works of Studio Ghibli yet again, if some combat mechanics are returning, and how floating island exploration is possibly designed. As time goes on, more theories will come about until the next trailer, and finally the release of the game.\n\nBreath of the Wild\u2019s sequel seems to start off right after the end of the original game. What we learned with the newest sequel is there is now a new counterpart to Link and his adventure continues in the clouds with floating islands. While several techniques and pieces of the world were shown, much of the sequel is still a mystery.\n\nThe sequel to Breath of the Wild is planned to release sometime in 2022.\n\n#zelda #botw #botw6", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSClLrdNMUE", "date_published": "2021-06-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
