Mary Lucia talks about the documentary Mary J. Blige's "My Life," directed by Vanessa Roth and streaming now on Amazon Prime Video.

Blige, known as the Queen of Hip Hop Soul, is very open when talking about the mental-health and other struggles she has faced. "She is not afraid to be vulnerable," Lucia says. "And I've never seen in my life, a documentary in which the fans feed off of the artist as much as they do in this. ... After a show, she's got people coming up to her and saying, 'You saved my life.' "

Sean Combs and Mary J. Blige are among the film's executive producers, and the executive music producer is Quincy Jones.

Hear more of what Mary Lucia has to say about Mary J. Blige's "My Life" in the video above.
