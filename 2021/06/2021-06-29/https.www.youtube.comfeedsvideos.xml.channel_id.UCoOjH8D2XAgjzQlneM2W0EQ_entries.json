Or did the US government have something to do with it?\nThis is the ridiculous, bizarre, strange rise & suspicious death\u2026 of John McAfee\n\nJohn David McAfee was born on a US Army base in England in 1945. \nMcAfee ended up growing up in Roanoke, Virginia. \nIn school, McAfee was hardly the nerd you\u2019d imagine would become one of the biggest tech entrepreneurs of the 20th century.\nHe admitted although he got straight A\u2019s and did well in math, he was a lazy kid and almost never studied.\nThen he got a position as a programmer at Lockheed Martin\nAnd in 1986 as home computers were taking off, two brothers in Pakistan launched the world\u2019s first computer virus nicknamed \u201cBrain\u201d - and McAfee saw an opportunity he couldn\u2019t pass up\n\n1987, McAfee launches McAfee Associates to create his all-in-one antivirus software, called VirusScan. Which was the first of its kind and covered all of the dozen or so computer viruses that existed back then.\nThe software worked and he decided to make it free for anyone to use\nWithin the first month of its launch, 4 million people were using it\nBy 1990, millions of computers were using it and companies were paying over $5m a year to license it\nAnd by 1992, more than half of the Fortune 500 companies had McAfee on their computers\nMcAfee became a tech icon\nHe became the leading voice on the threat of computer viruses and by 1992, McAfee Associates IPO\u2019d - making him worth $80 million dollars.\nIn 1994, McAfee was pushed out of management - so he sold his shares for $100m and left the company\nAnd from there he would spend the next one and a half decades living the life of a tech mogul with more much money than he knew what to do with\nHe bought multiple cars, built 9 homes, became an adrenaline junkie, then a new\\-age yoga guru, then built an adventure sports resort in New Mexico\u2026 \nBut by 2008, McAfee says he kept getting hit with frivolous lawsuits by people who wanted to take his money\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
