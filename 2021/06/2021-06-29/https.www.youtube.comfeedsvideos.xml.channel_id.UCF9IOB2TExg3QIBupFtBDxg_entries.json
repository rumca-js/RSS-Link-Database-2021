administration\n\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.29.450356v1.abstract?%3Fcollection=\n\n\nRecently a rare and novel complication of SARS-CoV-2 targeted adenovirus vaccines has emerged: \n\nthrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) \n\nLow platelets, clot formation at unusual sites and platelet-activating PF4-polyanion antibodies (reminiscent of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). \n\nIn vitro and in vivo models\n\nPlatelet-targeted autoimmunity\n\nWe show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation. \n\nAfter intravenous injection, these aggregates are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen\n\nThis is followed by a pronounced B-cell response with the emergence of circulating antibodies binding to platelets. \n\nOur work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS. \n\nHence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.\n\nConsistent results with mice and human platelets\n\nVaccines are routinely administered intramuscularly (i.m.) and trigger immune responses mainly in the draining lymph nodes\n\nBased on our finding that adenoviral vaccine binds to blood platelets, we hypothesized that accidental intravenous injection of adenoviral vaccine might lead to platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation with platelet activation\n\nThe decline in platelet count was dose-dependent and correlated directly with adenovirus-positive platelets circulating in the blood one hour after i.v. injection\n\nIntravenous but not i.m. injection of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 resulted in a strong increase in platelet-adenovirus aggregates\n\nAuthors\n\nMedizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I University Hospital Ludwig-Maximilian University
