NPR Music's Ann Powers will be joined by singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile, who performed her own tribute to 'Blue' in 2019, for a live conversation about this monumental album.\n\nRSVP https://jonimitchelllisteningparty.nprpresents.org  \n\n'Blue' was originally recorded and released in 1971, mostly featuring acoustic guitar, piano and Appalachian dulcimer played by Mitchell herself, with contributions by James Taylor and Stephen Stills. Among its many accolades, 'Blue' was chosen as NPR Music's greatest album of all time made by a woman: \"'Blue' remains the clearest and most animated musical map to the new world that women traced, sometimes invisibly, within their daily lives in the aftermath of the utopian, dream-crushing 1960s,\" Ann Powers wrote in the Turning the Tables feature, praising its melodies and lyrics as \"simple, but so radical.\" A remastered version of 'Blue' will be part of a box set that collects Joni Mitchell's first four albums.\n\n#jonimitchell #blue #brandicarlile", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6RNq3XKIQw", "date_published": "2021-06-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Jack Ingram, Miranda Lambert, Jon Randall: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nLyndsey McKenna | June 21, 2021\nThe trio of country superstar Miranda Lambert, long-tenured recording artist Jack Ingram and acclaimed songwriter-producer Jon Randall have history together: After collaborating on \"Tin Man\" from Lambert's 2016 record The Weight Of These Wings and \"Tequila Does\" from 2019's Wildcard, the artists spent five days last November recording in Marfa, Texas. In this (home) concert, the trio turns its quarantine album, The Marfa Tapes, into a quarantine Tiny Desk set, complete with a well-appointed desk in the corner of the frame.\n\nThe Marfa Tapes was largely recorded outdoors with just a few mics and guitars, and that intimacy at the heart of these songs remains present under the bright lights and against the dark wooden palette panelling of this session. The set opens with a one-two gut punch of \"Waxahachie\" followed by \"Tin Man.\" (\"Our award-winning song,\" Lambert jokes. The track won the 2018 Academy of Country Music Award for song of the year.) At its conclusion, Lambert lets out a laugh and the trio exchange knowing glances before finishing the show with \"In His Arms.\"\n\nThroughout the set, there's clear chemistry and camaraderie, evident in the ease on display between songs (\"I like that,\" Lambert says as they conclude the first track. \"I love it,\" Ingram one-ups.) Even if we can't all make it to Marfa for a songwriting session, a (home) concert feels like an honorary invitation to Ingram, Lambert and Randall's world.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Waxahachie\"\n\"Tin Man\"\n\"In His Arms\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJack Ingram: guitar, vocals\nMiranda Lambert: guitar, vocals\nJon Randall: guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: CookHouse Media LLC\nAudio: Brandon Bell\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Ann Powers\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Gabrielle Pierre\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #mirandalambert #jackingram #jonrandall", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKK5FV6zPkY", "date_published": "2021-06-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
