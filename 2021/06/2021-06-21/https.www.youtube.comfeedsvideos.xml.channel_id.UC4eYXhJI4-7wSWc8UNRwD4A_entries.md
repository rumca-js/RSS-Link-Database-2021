For its 50th anniversary, join us in an online listening party for Joni Mitchell's 'Blue.' NPR Music's Ann Powers will be joined by singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile, who performed her own tribute to 'Blue' in 2019, for a live conversation about this monumental album.

'Blue' was originally recorded and released in 1971, mostly featuring acoustic guitar, piano and Appalachian dulcimer played by Mitchell herself, with contributions by James Taylor and Stephen Stills. Among its many accolades, 'Blue' was chosen as NPR Music's greatest album of all time made by a woman: "'Blue' remains the clearest and most animated musical map to the new world that women traced, sometimes invisibly, within their daily lives in the aftermath of the utopian, dream-crushing 1960s," Ann Powers wrote in the Turning the Tables feature, praising its melodies and lyrics as "simple, but so radical." A remastered version of 'Blue' will be part of a box set that collects Joni Mitchell's first four albums.

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lyndsey McKenna | June 21, 2021
The trio of country superstar Miranda Lambert, long-tenured recording artist Jack Ingram and acclaimed songwriter-producer Jon Randall have history together: After collaborating on "Tin Man" from Lambert's 2016 record The Weight Of These Wings and "Tequila Does" from 2019's Wildcard, the artists spent five days last November recording in Marfa, Texas. In this (home) concert, the trio turns its quarantine album, The Marfa Tapes, into a quarantine Tiny Desk set, complete with a well-appointed desk in the corner of the frame.

The Marfa Tapes was largely recorded outdoors with just a few mics and guitars, and that intimacy at the heart of these songs remains present under the bright lights and against the dark wooden palette panelling of this session. The set opens with a one-two gut punch of "Waxahachie" followed by "Tin Man." ("Our award-winning song," Lambert jokes. The track won the 2018 Academy of Country Music Award for song of the year.) At its conclusion, Lambert lets out a laugh and the trio exchange knowing glances before finishing the show with "In His Arms."

Throughout the set, there's clear chemistry and camaraderie, evident in the ease on display between songs ("I like that," Lambert says as they conclude the first track. "I love it," Ingram one-ups.) Even if we can't all make it to Marfa for a songwriting session, a (home) concert feels like an honorary invitation to Ingram, Lambert and Randall's world.
