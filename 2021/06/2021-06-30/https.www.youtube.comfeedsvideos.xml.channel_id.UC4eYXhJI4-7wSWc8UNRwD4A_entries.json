Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nJacob Ganz | July 1, 2021\nYou don't have to wait long for a signature Sleater-Kinney moment in the band's Tiny Desk (home) concert. Over the first half of the title track to Path of Wellness, Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein sing of human frailty and self-improvement, vibrating with low notes of disgust. Then Brownstein shoots Tucker a knowing smile as they sing, \"You could never love me enough,\" and the pair, who have been making music together for nearly 30 years, start to unwind things: Brownstein hisses \"I am on a path of wellness\" through gritted teeth before ripping into a four-note riff that feels like it's pulling your guts out; Tucker sets her voice at maybe 75 percent howl capacity to sing \"I feel like I'm unknown\" and Brownstein still has to raise a hand to steady herself against the force. She can't stop grinning.\n\nTension is the heart of Sleater-Kinney's untouchable catalog, and Brownstein and Tucker know how to add layers to keep a song's meaning shifting. They recorded Path of Wellness at Halfling Studio in Portland in the midst of pandemic and protest, and returned to make this Tiny Desk. \"High In The Grass\" feels looser and hazier than on the album; \"Worry With You\" feels heavier. A treat for fans from the band's first decade: \"One Beat\" played with piano and bowed upright bass, making it that much easier to hear how, by the end, Tucker's pleas and Brownstein's yelp have been inextricably knitted together. Untangling things would be missing the point.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Path of Wellness\"\n\"High In The Grass\"\n\"One Beat\"\n\"Worry With You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCarrie Brownstein: guitar, vocals\nCorin Tucker: guitar, vocals\nFabi Reyna: guitar\nGalen Clark: keyboards\nBill Athens: bass\nVince Lirocchi: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Karen Murphy, Joe Meade\nAudio: Cian Riordan\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Gabrielle Pierre\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #sleaterkinney", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emPobfT6kOk", "date_published": "2021-07-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "From The Top: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nTom Huizenga | June 30, 2021\nIt's been said that our young people are the hope of our future. If that's true, the future of classical music looks blazingly bright, judging from these extraordinary performances by the young musicians in this triple-play Tiny Desk (home) concert.\n\nTeenagers from three locales around the country \u2013 Chicago, St. Louis and Palo Alto, Calif. \u2013 invite us into their homes for fresh takes on vintage classics, contemporary sounds and sophisticated pop arrangements. They are all alums of From the Top, the radio program (distributed by NPR) that spotlights today's terrific young players.\n\nIfetayo Ali-Landing, an outstanding 18-year-old cellist from Chicago starts us off. She's already performed with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and given her own TEDx talk. One of her calling cards is this propulsive performance of \"Evergreen,\" a pop song by Yebba, arranged for solo cello.\n\nPairing up in Palo Alto, the Davisson Guitar Duo features Jack, 16, and his sister Elle, 13. Their signature piece is the rhythmically driven Jongo, which offers flavors from composer Paulo Bellinati's native Brazil. The siblings finish each other's musical phrases with startling lyrical precision.\n\nSeventh-grader Jerry Chang, clad in his comfy exercise shorts, closes this cross-country Tiny Desk from home, playing Schubert's G-flat major Impromptu like someone twice his age. The gentle, rippling effects he gets from his still-growing 13-year-old hands, and the way he makes Schubert's wistful melody sing, is astonishing.\n\nThese Tiny Desk performances alone are proof enough that classical music in America is alive and in very talented hands.\n\nSET LIST\nYebba: \"Evergreen\" (arr.
