## LINUX
Users who have been postponing their move to GNOME 40 will probably be happy to learn that Dash To Panel is now functional on the latest GNOME version.

And speaking of replacing CentOS, Rocky Linux, now has its first public stable release out.

Version 5.13 of the Linux kernel has been released. The main headline feature is probably the support for Apple M1 SoCs, even though the GPU isn't fully operational yet.

There now seems to be a Debian User Repository, the debian based alternative to the Arch User Repository, or AUR.

Seems like Ubuntu will make changes to their Yaru theme again, basically removing the "mixed" option that uses black headerbars and white controls.
On that redesign note, it looks like Ubuntu might also change its logo soon, after 11 years of using the current white on orange "circle of friends".
