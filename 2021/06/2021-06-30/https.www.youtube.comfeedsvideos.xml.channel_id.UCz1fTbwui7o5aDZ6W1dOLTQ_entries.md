The word objective is one that seems to ruffle quite a few feathers when it's applied to art. Especially modern art and that isn't limited to pieces you find in a museum, but also our modern stories. From American comics to Hollywood the post-modernist ideal, as defined here in the video, seems to be the ultimate problem. A certain sect of post-modernism that seems to discard objectivity in favor of subjectivity all for the sake of their own rampant narcissism.

So welcome to paradise! Where artists no longer need to practice their craft, only praise is allowed and negativity is demonized for the sake of feelings! This is why Postmodern Art has become a Plague on Modern Art
