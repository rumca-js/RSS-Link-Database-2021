Faze Jarvis, Faze Teeqo and Faze Nikan have been suspended! Joel Morris released a statement where he admits to selling and steps down from $XCAD. \n\nUPDATE 2: When speaking about Faze Kay\u2019s wallet, I misspoke and said he had 6.2 billlion tokens. He actually had 6.2 MILLION tokens. Our estimations later in the video correctly accounted for this, but I misspoke in discussing KaY\u2019s holdings. Thanks to Steven Asarch for catching this mistake!\n\nSave the Kids was a crypto that was promoted by the top influencers in the world. \nFaze Kay, Faze Jarvis, Faze Teeqo, Faze Nikan and Ricegum all promoted the coin, along with many other popular influencers being involved. So far, we\u2019ve had no evidence of why the coin failed until today\u2026.\n\n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/coffeebreak_yt/\n\ud83c\udfb6 Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMSQ1yoPT2c&list=PL4qw3AkxFDSNhEgawXD1j6r0iN1072XIB&index=1\nThis video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.\n#savethekids #faze #crypto", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv6ne6VQCZI", "date_published": "2021-07-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCFQMnBA3CS502aghlcr0_aw", "title": "$3.6 Billion Stolen By Bitcoin Bros", "description": "Getting hacked is the new \"the dog ate my homework\" \n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/coffeebreak_yt/\n\ud83c\udfb6 Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMSQ1yoPT2c&list=PL4qw3AkxFDSNhEgawXD1j6r0iN1072XIB&index=1\nThis video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact.
