cases observed in the vaccine group were mild\n\nJanuary 25 through April 30, 2021\n\nAlpha (B.1.1.7) variant, became the predominant strain in the U.S\n\n100% efficacy against variants not considered

Ivermectin in early treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild COVID-19 \u2013 A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial\n\nSheba Medical Center, and Tel Aviv University\n\nIvermectin is an FDA-approved broad spectrum anti-parasitic agent\n\nInitially approved in humans in 1987\n\nNobel prize of Medicine in 2015\n\nWith its high safety profile, ivermectin is a potential treatment against COVID-19 in its different stages.\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.31.21258081v1\n\nTo assess whether ivermectin can shorten the viral shedding in patients at an early-stage of COVID-19 infection\n\nDouble blinded randomized control trial\n\nPatients receiving ivermectin 0\u00b72 mg/kg for 3 days vs placebo\n\nNon-hospitalized COVID-19 patients\n\nRT-PCR, recruitment and then every two days\n\nPrimary endpoint was reduction of viral-load on the 6th day\n\nAs reflected by Ct level more than 30 (non-infectious level)\n\nPrimary outcome was supported by determination of viral culture viability\n\nResults\n\nN = 89\n\nIvermectin group, 47 \n\nPlacebo group, 42\n\nFemales, 21\u00b76%\n\nAsymptomatic at recruitment, 16.8%\n\nSymptomatic, 83%\n\nOn day 6\n\nIvermectin group\n\n34 out of 47 (72%) reached the endpoint, (non-infectious level)\n\nPlacebo group\n\n21 out of 42 (50%) reached the endpoint, (non-infectious level)\n\nOdds of a negative test at day 6 was 2.62 time higher in the ivermectin group\n\nAlso\n\nIvermectin group, cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 3/23 (13\u00b70%)\n\nPlacebo group, cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 14/29

loads and viable cultures in the ivermectin group, which could lead to shortening isolation time in these patients.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0-90kvoQac", "date_published":
