Maybe that's sometimes all you feel like you have is your name.\n\n\"It's so worth watching.\"\n\n\"HALSTON\" also features Krysta Rodriguez as Halston's muse, Liza Minelli. The series is directed by Daniel Minahan, and it is streaming now on Netflix.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#marylucia #halston #netflix", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_6JLR0gQec", "date_published": "2021-06-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
