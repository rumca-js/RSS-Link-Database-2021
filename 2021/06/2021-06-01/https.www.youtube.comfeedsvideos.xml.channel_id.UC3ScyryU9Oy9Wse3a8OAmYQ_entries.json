The U.S. designated him a terrorist in 2013, with a $10 million reward for information leading to his capture.\n\nJolani is also the leader of the dominant force in Syria\u2019s Idlib province, which after more than 10 years of conflict is the last remaining opposition stronghold to President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime \u2014 and which is home to more than 3 million Syrian civilians, many of them displaced from other parts of the country.\n\nNow, Jolani says he and his current Islamist group are seeking a new relationship with the West. But can he be trusted?\n\nIn the FRONTLINE documentary \"The Jihadist,\" veteran FRONTLINE correspondent Martin Smith travels to Idlib to investigate Jolani's rebranding efforts, becoming the first American journalist to interview Jolani.
