Let's look back at the series with Richie as he recalls his experiences playing the entire series in 2021.  \n\nSince 2003, Call of Duty has been one of the biggest names in all of video games. Even to those who have never played, \u201cCall of Duty\u201d is a household name. It's a phenomenon that has continued its legacy in first-person shooters to this day. After all these years, more than 30 titles have been released onto multiple generations of consoles- each adding something new and solidifying the franchise into nearly unstoppable territory.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, Richie Bracamonte recalls his experiences with the entire series. While he\u2019s played quite a few of these titles, there are several that were missed, skipped over, and avoided. Until now. Starting from the very first Call of Duty game, he\u2019s playing and replaying his way through the entire series. In part 1, he will discuss all games from 2003 to 2008, ending with Treyarch\u2019s \u201cWorld at War\u201d.\n\nTo this day, Call of Duty is an unstoppable force. With a new game being released every year, and the massive success of Warzone, it looks like there\u2019s no slowing down. Be on the lookout for part 2 featuring Modern Warfare 2, 3 and the entire Black Ops series and more.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:44 - Call of Duty\n03:41 - United Offensive\n05:17 - Finest Hour\n07:34 - Call of Duty 2\n09:23 - Big Red One\n11:00 - Call of Duty 3\n13:44 - Roads to Victory\n14:57 - Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\n18:30 - World at War\n21:41 - World at War Final Fronts", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QALC_jNI9WM", "date_published": "2021-06-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "MORE Battlefield's Busted Guns Of All Time", "description": "Ahead of the\u00a0Battlefield\u00a06 announcement, we've got even MORE broken and overpowered weapons to share based on your suggestions, like the M2 Carl Gustav and a flying drone capable of road kills!\n\nList of Guns:\n\nM26 Dart - Battlefield 3 (00:30)\nModel 10A Hunter - Battlefield 1 (01:25)\nM2 Carl Gustav - Battlefield: Bad Company 2  (02:39)\nAEK-971 - Battlefield 4  (03:55)\nSMG 08/18 - Battlefield 1 (05:09)\nK10 - Battlefield Hardline (06:02)\n\nBonus:\nSUAV - Battlefield 4 (7:05)", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92I87yzGzx8", "date_published": "2021-06-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart Review (4K)", "description": "Rift Apart looks and plays better than ever thanks to new-generation hardware, but it's still the same lovable, goofy series at heart.\n\nInsomniac Games and Sony Interactive Entertainment's Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart will be available on PS5 on June 11, 2021.
