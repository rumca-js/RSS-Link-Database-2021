Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nNikki Birch | June 17, 2021\nThe studio backdrop of this Tiny Desk (home) concert is the perfect setting for the dynamic duo headlining this project. Pino Palladino is a prolific bassist whose sound you're\u00a0already intimately acquainted with\u00a0(even if you don't know it). Blake Mills, a guitarist and two-time Grammy nominee for producer of the year, has an impressive catalog of his own. Together, in the studio, the topshelf sidemen are in their element, distilling the sonic creativity that is the first release under Palladino's name,\u00a0Notes With Attachments.\n\nEight pulsing calls from saxophonist Sam Gendel usher us into\u00a0\"Just Wrong\"\u00a0a melodic meditation that unfolds like a blossom in timelapse. Guitar, bass, sax and Abe Rounds' colorful dustings of percussion in this song are magical; we soar with the musicians through varied repetitions of the melody before they gently set us back on our feet. The afterimage of our flight is still fading away when Palladino greets the viewers with a short and sweet introduction before opening \"Ekut\u00e9,\" a tune that explores traditional West African music, jazz and rock influences with a few modern touches of technology. \"Djurkel,\" the final offering in this set, is also experimental in nature. Palladino's trademark bass sound lies in the cut, the fertile ground on which Mills, Gendel and Rounds dance dreamily around each other. This is session musicianship at its best. Each watch reveals new depths to the mastery.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Just Wrong\"\n \u2022 \"Ekut\u00e9\"\n \u2022 \"Djurkel\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Pino Palladino: bass\n \u2022 Blake Mills: guitar\n \u2022 Abe Rounds: percussion\n \u2022 Sam Gendel: saxophone\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Jason Tippet, Carl McLaughlin, Julian Chavez\n \u2022 Audio: Joseph Lorge\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Nikki Birch\n \u2022 Video Producer: Kara Frame\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Andy Huether\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Maia Stern, Josh Rogosin, Gabrielle Pierre\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #pinopalladino #blakemills #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-V77_moZYw", "date_published": "2021-06-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
