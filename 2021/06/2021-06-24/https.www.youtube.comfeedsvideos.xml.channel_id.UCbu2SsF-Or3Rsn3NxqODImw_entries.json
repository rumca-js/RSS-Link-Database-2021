But what it did deliver on was giving us a taste of something we didn't know we wanted, and that taste is something fresh, new, and unexpecting, with each game offering something drastically different.\n\nSoup Pot is a chaotic cooking simulator with over a 100 real recipes to learn;  Tinykin is a colorful and animated take on Pikmin; Replaced offers a gritty, and refreshing take on the cyberpunk genre, giving 2D pixel art a cinematic flare rarely seen attempted; El Paso, Elsewhere is a spiritual successor to Max Payne, featuring a prominent black lead. It felt like there was something for everyone.\n\nSo while you may not have gotten the big update you were hoping for on Diablo 4, or Avowed, here's 23 hidden gems to keep an eye on in the meantime.\n\n#e32021", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g48QZBQ35-w", "date_published": "2021-06-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Elden Ring - Everything We Know So Far", "description": "Hidetaka Miyazaki revealed all new details about Elden Ring, Dark Souls spiritual successor, in a number of now translated interviews - including from Famitsu.
