 Any Zombies fans out there? I probably listen to "Odessey and Oracle" more than any other vinyl. I'm just always in the mood for it. So in honor of one of my all time favorite bands, we give you...Time of the Season!!!

LYRICS

It's the time of the season
When love runs high
In this time, give it to me easy
And let me try with pleasured hands

To take you in the sun to promised lands
To show you every one

It's the time of the season for loving

What's your name? (What's your name?)
Who's your daddy? (Who's your daddy?)
(Is he rich) Is he rich like me?
Has he taken (has he taken)
Any time (any time)
(To show) To show you what you need to live?

Tell it to me slowly, tell you what
I really want to know

It's the time of the season for loving

What's your name? (What's your name?)
Who's your daddy? (Who's your daddy?)
(Is he rich) Is he rich like me?
Has he taken (has he taken)
Any time (any time)
(To show) To show you what you need to live?

Tell it to me slowly, tell you what
I really want to know

It's the time of the season for loving
