In Alabama, a district attorney investigated and charged a state trooper in the 1965 killing of a man during a civil rights march. \n\nBut whether this case was a success is complicated. James digs into that case, and follows the money to try to understand whether funds the Till Act was supposed to provide were ever granted. And would an attempt to extend the Till Act beyond its 2017 sunset date offer a chance for lawmakers and the DOJ to address criticisms?\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.
