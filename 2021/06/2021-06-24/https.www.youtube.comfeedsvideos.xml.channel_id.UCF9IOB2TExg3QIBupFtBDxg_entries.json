Infection\n\nA Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis to Inform Clinical Guidelines\n\nhttps://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/Abstract/9000/Ivermectin_for_Prevention_and_Treatment_of.98040.aspx\n\nBackground\n\nThe antiparasitic ivermectin, with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has now been tested in numerous clinical trials.\n\nA 2018 application for ivermectin use for scabies gives a direct cost of $2.90 for 100 12-mg tablets.\n\nMost trials were registered, self-funded, and undertaken by clinicians\n\nWe assessed\n\nEfficacy of ivermectin treatment in reducing mortality\n\nChemoprophylaxis\n\nData sources\n\nDatabases up to April 25, 2021\n\nSifted for studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias \n\nMeta-analyses were conducted and certainty of the evidence was assessed\n\nGRADE approach\n\nhttps://training.cochrane.org/grade-approach\n\nhttps://bestpractice.bmj.com/info/toolkit/learn-ebm/what-is-grade/\n\nGRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations)\n\nReproducible and transparent framework for grading certainty in evidence\n\n100 organisations worldwide officially endorsing GRADE\n\nGRADE has four levels of evidence, certainty in evidence\n\nvery low\nlow\nmoderate\nhigh \n\nDecreasing confidence\n\nRisk of bias\n\nImprecision\n\nInconsistency\n\nIndirectness\n\nPublication bias\n\nIncreases confidence\n\nVery large magnitude of effect\n\nClear dose-response gradient\n\nResidual confounding is likely to decrease rather than increase the magnitude of effect\n\nData sources\n\n24 randomized controlled trials\n\nN =  3,406 participants\n\nIvermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin\n\nMeta-analysis of 15 trials (n = 2,438)\n\nAverage risk ratio 0.38\n\nModerate-certainty evidence\n\n(Confirmed using DerSimonian\u2013Laird method and Biggerstaff\u2013Tweedie method)\n\nIvermectin verses no ivermectin in hospital patients\n\nIvermectin, 2.3%\n\nNo ivermectin, 7.8%\n\nIvermectin prophylaxis reduced COVID-19 infection\n\n3 trials, n = 738\n\nAverage reduction 86%\n\nLow-certainty evidence \n\n(due to study design limitations and few included trials)\n\nClearly favored ivermectin use\n\nimprovement\n\ndeterioration\n\nSevere adverse events\n\nRare among treatment trials\n\nEvidence of no difference was assessed as low certainty\n\nConclusions\n\nModerate-certainty evidence finds that large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin. \n\nUsing ivermectin early in the clinical course may reduce numbers progressing\nto severe disease. \n\nThe apparent safety and low cost suggest that ivermectin is likely to have a significant impact on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally.\n\nCurrent NIH recommendations\n\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/ivermectin/\n\nthere are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19\n\nThe sample size of most of the trials was small\n\nVarious doses and schedules of ivermectin were used\n\nSome of the randomized controlled trials were open-label\n\nPatients received various concomitant (confounding) medications (e.g., doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, zinc, corticosteroids)\n\nThe severity of COVID-19 in the study participants was not always well described\n\nThe study outcome measures were not always clearly defined\n\n \n\nIvermectin for preventing and treating COVID\u201019 (April,
