Delta goes to Europe, First detected, October in India

Red list announced on 19th April for the 23rd April

UAE, 22nd April

France, 24th April

US, 4th May

During massive surge in India

Why is the UK worst / first effected?

April, 20,000 people arrived in UK from India in first 3 weeks

Multiple introductions

Any single introduction may simply die out

EU health officials, 90% of cases by late August.

Angela Merkel

Europe is on thin ice

All member states should quarantine arrivals from the UK

Headache and runny nose linked to Delta

Andrea Ammon, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)

preliminary data shows that it can also infect individuals that have received only one dose of the currently available vaccines

Two doses offered high protection against the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant

France
Delta in Les Landes in the south-west, 70%

Nationally, 10%

30% fully vaccinated

President Emmanuel Macron

We should all be vigilant because the Delta variant is coming

We see that it affects people who have not yet been vaccinated or who have only had one dose, which means we have to be even faster in this vaccination campaign

Russia

Cases, + 20,000

Deaths, 569 deaths 

Highest figures since January

Moscow - Delta variant, 90% of new infections, (mayor)

Vaccinations as of 16th June

First dose, 12.8%

Fully vaccinated, 9.9%

Portugal

New restrictions, Lisbon, Tagus valley

Delta more than 50% of new cases

Cabinet Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva

an attempt to contain the Delta variant

Country could have acted differently

Euro 2020

Germany v England in London next Tuesday

60,000 fans (75% capacity)

German World Medical Association

(Frank Ulrich Montgomery) 

Travelling to the UK runs the risk of getting infected with the Delta variant

I consider it irresponsible for even vaccinated people to travel to London in this situation

Denmark

Asked 4,000 fans to get tested

Three people tested Delta positive

Last Thursday's Denmark v Belgium

All three are thought to have been infected at the game

Fully vaccinating people offered a good way forward for resuming travel

Ivermectin for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Infection

A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis to Inform Clinical Guidelines

https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/Abstract/9000/Ivermectin_for_Prevention_and_Treatment_of.98040.aspx

Background

The antiparasitic ivermectin, with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has now been tested in numerous clinical trials.

A 2018 application for ivermectin use for scabies gives a direct cost of $2.90 for 100 12-mg tablets.

Most trials were registered, self-funded, and undertaken by clinicians

We assessed

Efficacy of ivermectin treatment in reducing mortality

Chemoprophylaxis

Data sources

Databases up to April 25, 2021

Sifted for studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias 

Meta-analyses were conducted and certainty of the evidence was assessed

GRADE approach

https://training.cochrane.org/grade-approach

https://bestpractice.bmj.com/info/toolkit/learn-ebm/what-is-grade/

GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations)

Reproducible and transparent framework for grading certainty in evidence

100 organisations worldwide officially endorsing GRADE

GRADE has four levels of evidence, certainty in evidence

very low
low
moderate
high 

Decreasing confidence

Risk of bias

Imprecision

Inconsistency

Indirectness

Publication bias

Increases confidence

Very large magnitude of effect

Clear dose-response gradient

Residual confounding is likely to decrease rather than increase the magnitude of effect

Data sources

24 randomized controlled trials

N =  3,406 participants

Ivermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin

Meta-analysis of 15 trials (n = 2,438)

Average risk ratio 0.38

Moderate-certainty evidence

(Confirmed using DerSimonian–Laird method and Biggerstaff–Tweedie method)

Ivermectin verses no ivermectin in hospital patients

Ivermectin, 2.3%

No ivermectin, 7.8%

Ivermectin prophylaxis reduced COVID-19 infection

3 trials, n = 738

Average reduction 86%

Low-certainty evidence 

(due to study design limitations and few included trials)

Clearly favored ivermectin use

improvement

deterioration

Severe adverse events

Rare among treatment trials

Evidence of no difference was assessed as low certainty

Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence finds that large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin. 

Using ivermectin early in the clinical course may reduce numbers progressing
to severe disease. 

The apparent safety and low cost suggest that ivermectin is likely to have a significant impact on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally.

Current NIH recommendations

https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/ivermectin/

there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19

The sample size of most of the trials was small

Various doses and schedules of ivermectin were used

Some of the randomized controlled trials were open-label

Patients received various concomitant (confounding) medications (e.g., doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, zinc, corticosteroids)

The severity of COVID-19 in the study participants was not always well described

The study outcome measures were not always clearly defined
