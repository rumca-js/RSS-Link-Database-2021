Looked for reasons to vaccinate

Nadhim Zahawi

We are on track for offering all over 50s who have had the first jab their second jab by June 21

Very high levels of uptake, in the 90%s

but we have got to make sure they get their second jab

5 or 6% who didn't have their jab, please come forward

21st June

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-june-21-lockdown-end-covid-vaccine-variant/

Jim McManus, vice-president of the Association of Directors of Public Health

Need an other 4 weeks

Data, and not dates

invest that little bit of time to keep us going forwards, it will stop us going backwards

The complete lifting of measures on the 21st of June not only risks an increase in cases and hospitalisation, 

but risks the introduction of new variants to the UK which will undermine our vaccination programme and derail our path back to normality

UK, Delta variant, 91%

CoViD symptom study

https://covid.joinzoe.com

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHBua3aXQ7c&t=403s

R = 1.3 (UK)

Delta, R = 6 (in no lockdown conditions)

Two doses needed

Young and unvaccinated

Cases could double in the next week, up to 20,000 per day

Increased cases will feed through into more deaths, 40 per day

Long CoViD will also increase

Change in presentation

Cold like features

Symptoms now (since May)

Headache

Sore throt

Runny nose

Fever

Cough

No loss of smell anymore

The four tests

The vaccine deployment programme continues successfully

Evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated

Infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS

The assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern.

Group of 7 summit

Prime Minister

The world needs this meeting

We must be honest: International order and solidarity were badly shaken by Covid. 

Nations were reduced to beggar-my-neighbor tactics in the desperate search for P.P.E., for drugs — and, finally, for vaccines

put those days behind us

This is the moment for the world’s greatest and most technologically advanced democracies to shoulder their responsibilities and to vaccinate the world, 

because no one can be properly protected until everyone has been protected

President Biden

Buying 500 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech
