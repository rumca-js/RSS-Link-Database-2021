This is a cover of Bo Burnham - Hands Up (Eyes On Me) from his special "Inside". It's performed on Synthstrom Deluge, a small modular system, the Elektron Octatrack, and a TC Helicon Voicelive 3. Read on to learn more, and please check out the Bo special "Inside". It's something special.

I wanted to cover this the first time I heard it. It's such a charged part of the special, the emotional nadir or apex depending on how you view it. 

MUSIC: 
The track was written on the Synsthrom Deluge. It's doing drums, piano, sub-bass, and sequencing the modular through MIDI into the Squarp Hermod. The Hermod is sending CV and gate to the Noise Engineering Manis Interitas (bass), Qu-Bit Surface (string plucks), Mutable Instruments Rings (distorted string at the end), and Qu-Bit Chord (small lead sound in middle and end). The Deluge and Modular are fed into the Elektron Octatrack where I'm able to use the crossfader to add quick drops in.

Vocals are coming from the TC Helicon Voicelive 3, doing doubling and reverb most of the time, and a big harmony during the peak. The Deluge has a track of chord data being fed to the Voicelive to pull off consistent harmonies. 

VIDEO AND RECORDING: 
I recorded 4 takes in one night of the performance with the super-wide camera angle and the top-down Deluge/singing angle. The next morning I re-recorded the performance and vocals separately but decided the vocals from the previous night's last take were the best. So the final take is a performance with the modular on its own and the vocals recorded separately, but what you see in the wide-angle and top-down angle was the performance that I got the vocals from. 

The following night I recorded 5 takes of b-roll, which are all the glamour shots of the gear and the feedback loop shot of singing via OBS. I pointed my GH5S at the screen and fed the HDMI out into OBS to capture video feedback in real time.

Lighting was done via 4 IP66 15W RGB color panels that have an app that controls them. There's a mode that takes the microphone audio and makes the lights strobe, which is what you see near the end.

Bo's special really meant a lot to me, and while I think it's a little crass to cover his emotional breakdown, I think it's a moment we can all identify with.
