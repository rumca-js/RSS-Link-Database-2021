Let\u2019s break down the reveal trailer and point out where each of these changes can be seen.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 (previously referred to as Battlefield 6) is the next confirmed entry in EA's big shooter franchise. The game takes place in the near future and makes some major changes to the series. Maps will be larger than previous games, the player count has been raised to 128 on next-gen platforms and PC. Conquest mode is getting a makeover with Sectors full of objectives to fight over causing matches to go between moments of calm and huge forces colliding in one place. 2042 will not have massive destruction but it will include the return of Levolution, ground deformation, and extreme weather events including sandstorms and tornadoes. 2042 will also sport a revamped class system that uses ten Specialists in the place of the classic Engineer, Recon, Support, and Assault classes. Specialists are fully voiced and each has a unique gadget and ability.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to take a look at the reveal trailer which is not actual gameplay but shows off the game\u2019s maps, Specialists, vehicles, and mechanics. We\u2019re taking you through frame by frame so that you have a full understanding ahead of the Gameplay Reveal on June 13th at E3 2021.\u00a0\n\nBattlefield 2042 will have a technical playtest in early July with more announcements at EA Play Live on July 22nd. And the totally not battle-royale mode Hazard Zone will be in alpha pre-launch, followed by an open beta at a later date. Battlefield 2042 releases on October 22nd, 2021 for PC, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fimQ1F9YXXE", "date_published": "2021-06-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fortnite Season 7 Chapter 2 Battle Pass Trailer", "description": "Get a glimpse of the Chapter 2 for Fortnite Season 7, which showcases the invasion.

Let's look back at the series with Richie as he recalls his experiences playing the entire series in 2021.  \n\nSince 2003, Call of Duty has been one of the biggest names in all of video games. Even to those who have never played, \u201cCall of Duty\u201d is a household name. It's a phenomenon that has continued its legacy in first-person shooters to this day. After all these years, more than 30 titles have been released onto multiple generations of consoles- each adding something new and solidifying the franchise into nearly unstoppable territory.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, Richie Bracamonte recalls his experiences with the entire series. While he\u2019s played quite a few of these titles, there are several that were missed, skipped over, and avoided. Until now. Starting from the very first Call of Duty game, he\u2019s playing and replaying his way through the entire series. In part 1, he will discuss all games from 2003 to 2008, ending with Treyarch\u2019s \u201cWorld at War\u201d.\n\nTo this day, Call of Duty is an unstoppable force. With a new game being released every year, and the massive success of Warzone, it looks like there\u2019s no slowing down. Be on the lookout for part 2 featuring Modern Warfare 2, 3 and the entire Black Ops series and more.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:44 - Call of Duty\n03:41 - United Offensive\n05:17 - Finest Hour\n07:34 - Call of Duty 2\n09:23 - Big Red One\n11:00 - Call of Duty 3\n13:44 - Roads to Victory\n14:57 - Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\n18:30 - World at War\n21:41 - World at War Final Fronts", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QALC_jNI9WM", "date_published": "2021-06-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "MORE Battlefield's Busted Guns Of All Time", "description": "Ahead of the\u00a0Battlefield\u00a06 announcement, we've got even MORE broken and overpowered weapons to share based on your suggestions, like the M2 Carl Gustav and a flying drone capable of road kills!\n\nList of Guns:\n\nM26 Dart - Battlefield 3 (00:30)\nModel 10A Hunter - Battlefield 1 (01:25)\nM2 Carl Gustav - Battlefield: Bad Company 2  (02:39)\nAEK-971 - Battlefield 4  (03:55)\nSMG 08/18 - Battlefield 1 (05:09)\nK10 - Battlefield Hardline (06:02)\n\nBonus:\nSUAV - Battlefield 4 (7:05)", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92I87yzGzx8", "date_published": "2021-06-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart Review (4K)", "description": "Rift Apart looks and plays better than ever thanks to new-generation hardware, but it's still the same lovable, goofy series at heart.\n\nInsomniac Games and Sony Interactive Entertainment's Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart will be available on PS5 on June 11, 2021.
