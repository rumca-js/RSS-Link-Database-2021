Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nLauren Onkey  | June 9, 2021\nMerry Clayton's Tiny Desk concert begins with the essentials. After a brief piano intro, she begins to sing \"Beautiful Scars\" \u2014 the title track of her new album \u2014 in a powerful and knowing voice. That simple pairing commands attention: \"I've been on the battlefield of life. / I've been through it. / But I just had to go through that to get to this.\" She sings in dialogue with five superb singers, all with serious gospel chops \u2014 including members of The Waters and Take 6 \u2014 and a band of seasoned pros. \"Stand up and be proud of your scars,\" she sings. The vibe is relaxed, but purposeful.\n\nThis performance is an inspiring comeback for Clayton, who has been making great music for almost 60 years. Clayton is one of rock's most important backup singers (for starters, see The Rolling Stones' \"Gimme Shelter,\" Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\" and Carole King's\u00a0Tapestry). She recorded several excellent solo albums that never broke big, but eventually received the recognition she deserved in the 2013 documentary\u00a020 Feet From Stardom. In 2014, she was in a serious car accident that required months in the hospital and extensive rehabilitation. With encouragement from her longtime friend and producer\u00a0Lou Adler\u00a0\u2014 who's watching this performance off-camera \u2014 she decided to record a\u00a0new album.\n\nAll the songs in this Tiny Desk performance testify to the power of faith and friendship. \"Oh What a Friend,\" written by Terry Young, features soaring call-and-response vocals between Clayton and the vocalists. They conclude with a stirring and joyous version of Sam Cooke's 1956 classic \"Touch the Hem of His Garment.\"\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Beautiful Scars\"\n \u2022 \"Oh What a Friend\"\n \u2022 \"Touch The Hem Of His Garment\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Merry Clayton: vocals\n \u2022 Terry Young: piano\n \u2022 Charles Fearing: guitar\n \u2022 Nathan East: bass\n \u2022 Harvey Mason: drums\n \u2022 Maxine Waters: vocals\n \u2022 Julie Waters: vocals\n \u2022 Oren Waters: vocals\n \u2022 Alvin Chea: vocals\n \u2022 Alfie Siles: vocals\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Lou Adler, Vincent Adam Paul\n \u2022 Audio: Jill Tengan\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Lauren Onkey\n \u2022 Video Producer: Kara Frame\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Maia Stern, Gabrielle Pierre\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#merryclayton #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHod4ZPzfLc", "date_published": "2021-06-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Rostam: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

People get on. People get off.\" And it just keeps going. Watching Rostam's Tiny Desk performance, it's easy to imagine you're on that life-train, traveling around and around, catching glimpses of instruments and faces as they pass by, before coming back where you started. It's a clever, if sometimes dizzying nod to the overarching themes of Rostam's Changephobia, a collection of songs that simultaneously look to the past and the future.\n\nRostam and a group of backing musicians play two cuts from that album: the relatively breezy, escapist ballad \"4Runner\" and the reflective \"These Kids We Knew.\" The group closes with \"In a River,\" a one-off single from 2018 that sits perfectly alongside the newer songs as he recalls a warm night skinny dipping with a friend.\n\nSET LIST\n\"4Runner\"\n\"These Kids We Knew\"\n\"In a River\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nRostam Batmanglij: vocals, guitar, harmonica\nJulian McClanahan Calvert: guitar, mandolin, harmonies\nLogan Kane: bass\nHenry Solomon: saxophone, congas, harmonica, 808 sample pad\nBenji Lysaght: guitar\nConor Malloy: drums, percussion\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Jason Lester, Laura Burhenn\nAudio: Joey Messina-Doerning\nSpecial thanks to Our Secret Handshake\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Robin Hilton\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Gabrielle Pierre\nExecutive Producer: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #rostam", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8LTs6EZF-Y", "date_published": "2021-06-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
