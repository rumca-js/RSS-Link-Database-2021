<p>I was invited to be interviewed on Monero Talk and it's just been
released. Monero Talk is a podcast on, well... Monero the actually
private cryptocurrency, which <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/monero-maximalism-or-how-bitcoin-is-a-coin.html">I've
written</a> and <a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/bitcoin-will-be-regulated-to-hell-monero:6">done
videos
on</a>
in the past.</p>

<p>We discuss a lot of topic on private and free/open source monetary
technology and dab on Boomercoiners. Some topics of discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>The difference between truly decentralized self-propelling
cryptocurrency projects and companies that use blockchains just for
crowdfunding.</li>
<li>The generally overlooked problems of the blossoming cyberpunk
surveillence dystopia we are coming to live in.</li>
<li>The various issues with Bitcoin, including the imaginary Layer 2
coping mechanism as an excuse for not fixing obvious problems.</li>
<li>Even Ted Kazynski and technology</li>
</ul>
<p>I might post segmented clips of it later if I find something notable
when I watch it.</p>
