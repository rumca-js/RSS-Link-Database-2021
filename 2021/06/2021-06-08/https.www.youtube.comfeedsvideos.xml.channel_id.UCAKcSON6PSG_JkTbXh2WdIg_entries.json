Cracked Up is an incredible story about Hammond's childhood and trauma. And the fact that he was as high performing as he was, in some ways, makes a lot of sense. In fact, he was a shapeshifter; Whoopi Goldberg calls him a shapeshifter because I think, as people and children of trauma, there's almost a need to create someone else to deal with certain things, which is kind of what he did through some of the characters. But this film is so much deeper than that. ... I won't tell you everything. A lot of it is very heartbreaking. He truly got through it with humor, and talent, but also there's so many visible scars.\"\n\n\"Cracked Up\" is directed by Michelle Esrick and it's available for streaming on Netflix.\n\n#crackedup #darrellhammond #abramorama", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_X1KOUdFI", "date_published": "2021-06-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
