We reconstruct some of the scenes around Ganondorf's awakening, theorize what happens with the Master Sword, and examine details you might have missed about the Zonai's involvement.\n\nWe mention other important things, such as influences from works of Studio Ghibli yet again, if some combat mechanics are returning, and how floating island exploration is possibly designed. As time goes on, more theories will come about until the next trailer, and finally the release of the game.\n\nBreath of the Wild\u2019s sequel seems to start off right after the end of the original game. What we learned with the newest sequel is there is now a new counterpart to Link and his adventure continues in the clouds with floating islands. While several techniques and pieces of the world were shown, much of the sequel is still a mystery.\n\nThe sequel to Breath of the Wild is planned to release sometime in 2022.\n\n#zelda #botw #botw6", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSClLrdNMUE", "date_published": "2021-06-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts To MORE Team Fortress 2 Guns", "description": "Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the weaponry of Team Fortress 2, including the four-barrelled Shortstop, \u2018The Original\u2019 rocket launcher, and the ridiculous \u2018Panic Attack\u2019 shotgun.\n\nIn the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of Team Fortress 2 and\u00a0 compares them to their real-life counterparts.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan's work, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries\n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nAnd if you would like to become a member of the Royal Armouries, you can get a membership here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/\n\nYou can purchase Jonathan's book here - https://www.headstamppublishing.com/bullpup-rifle-book\n\nYou can check out Jonathan on the Fighting on Film podcast here - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNsrU8HuCAzaizIqbAcNZ5VUQW789z3ZF\n\n#firearms #teamfortress2 #fortress2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9YgonyJmc4", "date_published": "2021-06-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Gang Beasts, Limbo, Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life | Game Pass Show", "description": "Learn about what's new, what's leaving, and what you should be playing on Game Pass.

It can be a lot to keep track of, not to mention figuring out what to play from its massive library. That's why we created the Game Pass Show.\n\nJoin Persia to learn what's new, what's leaving, and what you should consider playing. This week, Game Pass sees the arrival of Limbo, Gang Beasts, Iron Harvest and more. Persia also takes the time to elaborate on her time playing Sea of Thieves' latest DLC, A Pirate's Life. \n\nAlso, make sure to stick to the end for the pick of the week - a section where Persia hand picks either a hidden gem, or sheds some light on a game you should check out before it leaves Game Pass.\n\n#gamepass #gangbeasts #limbo #seaofthieves", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrGe7UL--uM", "date_published": "2021-06-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Scarlet Nexus Video Review", "description": "The story of Scarlet Nexus might be a mess, but fun action and great character moments make it worth your time.\n\nHeidi played through all of Yuito\u2019s story and some of Kasane\u2019s path for this review.
