Oxford\n\nInvestigating treatments for people at more risk of serious illness from COVID-19\n\nN = 5,106 so far\n\nIvermectin is a safe, broad spectrum antiparasitic drug which is in wide use globally to treat parasitic infections.\n\nKnown antiviral properties\n\nSmall pilot studies show that early administration with ivermectin can reduce viral load and the duration of symptoms in some patients with mild COVID-19.\n\nProfessor Chris Butler\n\nNuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences\n\nJoint Chief Investigator\n\nIvermectin is readily available globally, \n\nhas been in wide use for many other infectious conditions so it\u2019s a well-known medicine with a good safety profile, \n\nand because of the early promising results in some studies it is already being widely used to treat COVID-19 in several countries.\n\nBy including ivermectin in a large-scale trial like PRINCIPLE, we hope to generate robust evidence to determine how effective the treatment is against COVID-19, \n\nand whether there are benefits or harms associated with its use\n\nTreatment group\n\nThree-day course of oral ivermectin \n\nControl group\n\nStandard NHS care\n\nThe trial is supported by a vast network of health and care professionals in care homes, pharmacies, NHS 111 Hubs, hospitals and more than 1400 GP practices across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.", "link":
