E3 didn't give us a release date, but it did drop new information through a Zelda: Breath of the Wild Sequel Trailer. We reconstruct some of the scenes around Ganondorf's awakening, theorize what happens with the Master Sword, and examine details you might have missed about the Zonai's involvement.

We mention other important things, such as influences from works of Studio Ghibli yet again, if some combat mechanics are returning, and how floating island exploration is possibly designed. As time goes on, more theories will come about until the next trailer, and finally the release of the game.

Breath of the Wild’s sequel seems to start off right after the end of the original game. What we learned with the newest sequel is there is now a new counterpart to Link and his adventure continues in the clouds with floating islands. While several techniques and pieces of the world were shown, much of the sequel is still a mystery.

The sequel to Breath of the Wild is planned to release sometime in 2022.

Learn about what's new, what's leaving, and what you should be playing on Game Pass. This your Game Pass digest for June 26, 2021.

Game Pass has a lot of games, and twice a month there's more coming, and some leaving. It can be a lot to keep track of, not to mention figuring out what to play from its massive library. That's why we created the Game Pass Show.

Join Persia to learn what's new, what's leaving, and what you should consider playing. This week, Game Pass sees the arrival of Limbo, Gang Beasts, Iron Harvest and more. Persia also takes the time to elaborate on her time playing Sea of Thieves' latest DLC, A Pirate's Life. 

Also, make sure to stick to the end for the pick of the week - a section where Persia hand picks either a hidden gem, or sheds some light on a game you should check out before it leaves Game Pass.

## Scarlet Nexus Video Review

The story of Scarlet Nexus might be a mess, but fun action and great character moments make it worth your time.

Heidi played through all of Yuito’s story and some of Kasane’s path for this review. She put in about 28 hours of total playtime. Kagero is her favorite team buddy, if only because she loves ambushing enemies without having to worry about that whole “stealth” nonsense. PlayStation 5 review code was provided by the publisher.
