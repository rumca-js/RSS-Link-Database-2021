Not only is Tinder a waste of time, Tinder is ruining your ability to find meaningful relationships. Tinder is bad. Delete Tinder. This is what the education system fails to tell you.

The intro to this video was copied from the video ‘the untold truth about money’ and the concept and idea behind this is not original. All credit goes to James Jani, https://www.youtube.com/c/JamesJani.

His editing on the toxic world of self help and the untold truth about money videos greatly inspired me to improve the quality of this channels future videos. 

In this video you'll understand why you should stop using tinder because Tinder is toxic. This is why tinder is a waste of time and why tinder is bad for you. Delete tinder and all other dating apps. Tinder is a waste of time for guys and girls  and stops you from meaningful relationships. Tinder is bad for guys. Here's some true education.Tinder is bad and is making money from you. This is how Tinder made billions.
