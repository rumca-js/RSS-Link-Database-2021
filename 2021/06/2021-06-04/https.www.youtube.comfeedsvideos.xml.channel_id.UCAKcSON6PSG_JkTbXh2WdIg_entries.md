ABOUT THE PERFORMERS

House of Dance Twin Cities — Established in 2014, House of Dance Twin Cities is Minnesota's first and premier dance studio dedicated to teaching breakdancing, popping & locking and hip hop dance classes to people of all ages and experience levels. The instructors humbly maintain that they are students themselves, dedicated to improving their dance so that they can share more with others. They take their art and their jobs very seriously and appreciate everyone who entrusts their learning with them.

Koo Koo Kanga Roo — Koo Koo Kanga Roo is a dance party of the senses. For the last 12 years, lifelong friends and collaborators Bryan and Neil have toured the globe delighting fans with their high-energy music, infectious positivity, and interactive live show. Of course, the global pandemic of 2020 threatened to put an end to the carefree fun that had come to define the band, but instead of putting the group on pause or looking for office jobs, Bryan and Neil doubled down and created their most triumphant and expansive album yet.

Preservation Hall Jazz Band — Every night, Preservation Hall in New Orleans presents intimate, acoustic concerts featuring bands made up of a current collective of more than 50 local master Traditional New Orleans Jazz musicians. These masters have learned the traditional style from the greats who played before them at Preservation Hall. There is no audition process to play at the Hall. While many of our musicians are related to the original players by lineage, they are all connected through the sheer power of tradition.
