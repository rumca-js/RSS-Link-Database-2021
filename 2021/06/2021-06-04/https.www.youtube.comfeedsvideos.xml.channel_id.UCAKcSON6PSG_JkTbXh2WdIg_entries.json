The instructors humbly maintain that they are students themselves, dedicated to improving their dance so that they can share more with others. They take their art and their jobs very seriously and appreciate everyone who entrusts their learning with them.\n\nKoo Koo Kanga Roo \u2014 Koo Koo Kanga Roo is a dance party of the senses. For the last 12 years, lifelong friends and collaborators Bryan and Neil have toured the globe delighting fans with their high-energy music, infectious positivity, and interactive live show. Of course, the global pandemic of 2020 threatened to put an end to the carefree fun that had come to define the band, but instead of putting the group on pause or looking for office jobs, Bryan and Neil doubled down and created their most triumphant and expansive album yet.\n\nPreservation Hall Jazz Band \u2014 Every night, Preservation Hall in New Orleans presents intimate, acoustic concerts featuring bands made up of a current collective of more than 50 local master Traditional New Orleans Jazz musicians. These masters have learned the traditional style from the greats who played before them at Preservation Hall. There is no audition process to play at the Hall. While many of our musicians are related to the original players by lineage, they are all connected through the sheer power of tradition. \n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thecurrent #rockthecradle", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHCWyWZ9W_A", "date_published": "2021-06-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "77 - 81 Gang of Four box set unboxing", "description": "With the release of \"77-81,\" Gang of Four have put together one of the best vault boxsets this side of Prince, featuring their first two studio albums along with bonus singles, a live concert recording, and an incredible photo book, documenting the post-punk band that would go on to influence everyone from Tom Morello to Flea to El-P from Run the Jewels. \n\nJim McGuinn, host of \"Teenage Kicks\" on The Current, unboxes 77-81.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#gangoffour #boxset #unboxing", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW-tetI-v4Y", "date_published": "2021-06-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Death Cab for Cutie - two live performances (2019)", "description": "This week in 2008, Death Cab for Cutie performed in our studio.
