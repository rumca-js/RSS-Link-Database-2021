I got to travel all the way to Reno, NV to try out Ubisoft's new FarCry VR game. At the zero latency location based in the Gran Sierra hotel I got to sit down and talk with a representative from the company to explain the technology, pros and cons of location based VR and also play quite a few sessions of FarCry VR. Here's everything about it and my proposed future of free roam location based VR. This was such a fun video and I got to do it with a good friend, LSToast. Hopefully you enjoy it!\n\n\nVal VR Esports made this happen, thank them for this.
