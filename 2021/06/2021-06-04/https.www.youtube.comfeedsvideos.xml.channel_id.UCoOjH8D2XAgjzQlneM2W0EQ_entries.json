Cementing his position as one of the highest paid athletes in history. Logan Paul on the other hand is set to make $20,000,000, a fifth of what Mayweather gets.\n\nAt its most basic level, you have a boxing match, the Mayweather Paul fight, and each boxing match has a prize money pool that both fighters get a cut of no matter who wins. That prize money is also called the Purse. For the infamous Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao fight back in 2015, that purse was reportedly half a billion dollars. In the case of the Mayweather vs Paul fight, the purse is an estimated $100m. But in this case, Mayweather gets not 60% of that purse, but 80%, or $80m. While Logan Paul only gets to walk away with $20m. Why the uneven split? Simple - it\u2019s because the prize money is made up how many people buy the pay-per-view show, ticket sales, and other broadcasts.\n\nThe first rumblings of a Mayweather/Pacquiao fight was way back in 2010. It took 5 whole years of trash talking, going back and forth, negotiating the prize money split, before the fight actually happened in 2015. In the business of boxing, everything leading up to the fight is theatre - both fighters have to do their part in making the fight marketable. Which usually includes a lot of trash talking and drama. So trash talk your way to a giant purse then walk home with $100m right?\n\nAs a football star in the NFL, your life is a lot easier. But as a boxer, you are literally your own business. You get paid as an independent contractor per fight, no regular paychecks, you don\u2019t work for any of the boxing event promoters - If you don\u2019t fight you don\u2019t get paid.\n\nFans want to see the most dangerous, exciting fights. But Floyd realized that it was in his best interests to take on the least riskiest fights. Instead of going up against Pacquiao in his prime, Floyd waited 5 years for him to age a little, get a little worn down, build up more and more hype to increase that prize money. And then he fought a more tamed version of Pacquiao 5 years later and walked away with $100m.\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
