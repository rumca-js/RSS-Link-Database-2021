Nearly 14 years have passed since the game's release on the Xbox 360, and that means a whole lot of technical advancement has been applied to the game. With that in mind, we're taking a look at Mass Effect Legendary Edition and the original Mass Effect's PC release to see just how much the new remaster has improved on the original.\n\nThe video above lets you check out both versions of Mass Effect, sticking to the early portions of the game. We've got some direct comparisons of Mass Effect characters to show how lighting and textures have been improved. The comparison also extends to Eden Prime, the game's first combat mission, and the Citadel, where you'll spend some time talking with humans and aliens and advancing the story.\n\nWhile Mass Effect has seen a lot of technological improvements in the Legendary Edition, it's important to note that the story remains the same. You'll be playing through a smoother, better-looking version of the 2007 sci-fi RPG classic, but for all intents and purposes, this is the same game. As Jordan Ram\u00e9e noted in his review in progress, the Legendary Edition brings an enhanced version of the original game that's a lot easier to play and looks a lot better, but it's not without its visual and gameplay quirks.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:47 - Tile Screen & Opening\n02:17 - Characters\n07:26 - Eden Prime\n10:53 - The Citadel", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04f9T0_xSX4", "date_published": "2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mass Effect Legendary Edition Livestream", "description": "Join Lucy James and Tamoor Hussain as they play through the opening of the remaster of Mass Effect from the Legendary Edition.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Anm5uKxI0I8", "date_published": "2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Total War: Warhammer 3 Hands On Battle Preview", "description": "Total War: Warhammer 3 is introducing new factions in Kislev, Cathay, Khorne, Nurgle, Slaanesh and Tzeench, but also bringing a new battle type to the franchise.

It's an awful collection task quest, deathly boring to do even with a guide. The reward isn\u2019t even all that great, being nothing but some measly experience points.  The saving grace being that because the whole thing is so meaningless, you can skip it without fear of missing out.\n\nHowever, in Mass Effect 3, there is a small side quest on the Citadel for Shepard stan Conrad Verner. Turns out that before Conrad devoted his life to worshiping the Commander, he wrote a doctoral dissertation on xenotechnology and dark energy integration and can help Shepard obtain some ancient tech, tech that happens to be written in ancient asari dialect. If you collected 10 of the 16 asari writings all the way back in Mass Effect 1, you get some special dialogue as well as a plus five bonus to your war assets.\n\nThis is one of those rare moments most players didn\u2019t fully experience in their Mass Effect trilogy playthrough: Strange or unique outcomes that required you to do something either really obscure to get or because you made choices in the past that fall in-between the cracks of the series\u2019 mortality system. Most players tend to play a pure pure paragon or renegade playthrough, but if you mix and match you get some pretty interesting consequences. In this video, I\u2019m going to go through a few of my favourite rare Mass Effect outcomes.\n\nOriginally this video was really long, so if you have other moments you\u2019d love to see, or have your own favourites, drop them in the comments below or like this video and subscribe so we know you want to see more.
