The images apparently were shot at the end of spring in 1917: the marquee at the long-gone Majestic Theatre, at Washington and Park, is seen heralding “A Small Town Girl,” a silent movie starring “winsome June Caprice.” Ads in The Oregonian and the Oregon Journal at the time state that the picture would play only from May 31 through June 2 of that year.
