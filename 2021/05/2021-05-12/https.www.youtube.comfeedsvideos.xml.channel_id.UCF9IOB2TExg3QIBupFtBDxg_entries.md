UK SAGE, Emergency meeting over rapid spread of Indian variant
17th May
21st June

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/12/rapid-spread-indian-covid-variant-prompts-emergency-sage-meeting/

UK, 45 days first discovered

Cases, = 727

About 3 times quicker than SA variant
 
Bolton, epicentre, cases doubled in past week

Blackburn, Bedford, South Northamptonshire, Sefton, Tynemouth, Glasgow

MP for Bolton, Yasmin Quareshi

Residents had been slow to get vaccinated

React study, Imperial College London

Infections are spreading more rapidly amongst the Asian community, and in some of the other groups in the population

Andy Burnham

Requested  Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, all over-16s in Bolton, and Greater Manchestee

to mitigate the risks of spread in those communities where we are seeing more transmission

Cases inked to international travel

Prof James Naismith, Rosalind Franklin Institute

We should view it as a country-wide problem

Localised restrictions unlikely to work

but maybe Sage already have that data 

before we continue to unlock

For all those above the age of 18

Irrespective of Covid-19 symptoms

12 mg of ivermectin for five days

State Health Minister Vishwajit Rane

Goa would be the first state in the country to administer, to its adult citizens

as a step towards protecting lives

State government, drug will be given to the people through its chain of health centres

There have been studies in journals of therapeutics, 

there have been studies in the US, UK, Japan, Germany

that when this is administered in advance

when the entire population is administered this treatment

their mortality rate fell and effects of Covid-19 on that individual were also less
 
All our doctors and experts, the chief minister have unanimously decided to go ahead with this

We should go ahead and give it to the population

It’s a must

Dr Vinayak Buvaji, Goa chapter, Indian Medical Association

Treatment should not be given for a short period of five days

but should ideally be continued till the pandemic is brought under control

The ideal regimen of ivermectin is to administer it on the first, third and seventh day

and then continue it once a week till the pandemic is brought under control

Giving the tablets only for five days will not be impactful

The people weighing below 60 kg should be given the 12 mg dose of ivermectin

while those above 60 kg should be given the 18 mg dose

Dr Buvaji writing to state Health Department to change the proposed ivermectin dose protocol

Chief Scientist, World Health Organization, Dr Soumya Swaminathan

Safety and efficacy are important when using any drug for a new indication

WHO recommends against the use of ivermectin for #COVID19 except within clinical trials

Merck Statement on Ivermectin use During the COVID-19 Pandemic

https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/

No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies 

No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease

A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine

12 to 15 years of age

Janet Woodcock, (FDA)

allows for a younger population to be protected

bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy

and to ending the pandemic

March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2021

1.5 million COVID-19 cases in individuals 11 to 17 years

Two doses, three weeks apart

Potential benefits of this vaccine in individuals 12 years of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks


 

Scientific Brief: SARS-CoV-2 Transmission (7th May)

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/sars-cov-2-transmission.html

https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by exposure to infectious respiratory fluids

People release respiratory fluids

Infection depends on concentration of viral particles

Three principal ways: 

Inhalation

Mucous membranes depositions

Touching mucous membranes

Factors in inoculum

Airstream 

Thermal layering and 

Initial jetting of exhalations

Enclosed spaces

Increased exhalation

Prolonged exposure

Progressive loss of viral viability and infectiousness

Temperature

Humidity

Ultraviolet radiation 

Infection still possible

More than 6 feet away

Passing through a space an infectious person has left

Prevention of transmission

Physical distancing 

Well-fitting masks

Adequate ventilation

Avoidance of crowded indoor spaces
