Managing your resources, knowing how to fight, and how to make money are all important to your survival. If you\u2019re new to the genre, this is the survival guide for you.\n\nIn this video, veteran survival horror player and Resident Evil aficionado, Kurt Indovina, shares some vital tips and tricks in order to ensure your survival in Resident Evil Village. If you\u2019ve spent some time in the shoes of Leon Kennedy, blasting your way through the Los Plagas-controlled villagers of Resident Evil 4, then you should have no problem adapting to Village\u2019s combat, inventory management, treasure hunting, and merchant. But if you\u2019re new to the franchise, it can be a lot to take in.\u00a0\n\nKurt breaks it down into three categories: combat, exploration, and the Duke.  Kurt gives tips on fighting the game's werewolf-like enemies, Lycans, how to look for treasure, the importance of hunting animals, killing crows for pocket change, and best practices when selling your loot as well as upgrading your weapons. While it\u2019s easy to be distracted by Lady Dimitrescu\u2019s empowering demeanor, don\u2019t be fooled, there\u2019s plenty more the game offers in terms of frights and thrills to pay attention too.\n\nWhile Village takes a lot of cues from its previous installment Resident Evil 7, the many environments of the game can be far more daunting than the Baker house Ethan Winters slithered through all those years back. In Resident Evil Village, Ethan must rescue his daughter Rose from the grasp of Mother Miranda, and it's up to you as the player to be prepared for the dangers that await.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOur review: https://youtu.be/Kmkm-LQbcDo\nResident Evil's Complete Timeline Explained: https://youtu.be/QkPgowr-T9g\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro 0:00\nCombat\nTip 1 - Go for the knees 0:32\nTip 2 - Time your counters 1:31\nTip 3 - It's okay to run 1:54\nExploration 2:50\nTip 1 - Always check your map before leaving a room 3:09\nTip 2 - Backtrack 3:55\nTip 3 - Go hunting 4:44\nThe Duke\nTip 1 - Check that treasure before you sell it 5:24\nTip 2 - Sell your guns 5:57\nOutro 6:29", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bL1ehw394E", "date_published": "2021-05-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Epic Vs Apple Explained", "description": "The trial between tech giants Apple and Epic Games has started.

But it wasn't until Resident Evil 3: Nemesis that it became a staple in the long running franchise. Since Nemesis' debut in 3, players have been chased and terrorized by likes of Mr. X in the RE2 Remake, RE7's Jack Baker, RE6's Ustanak, and now the ever-adored Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village--and they're all equally very stressful and horrifying.\u00a0\n\nKurt Indovina gets scared very, very easily. Yet, in spite of his trembling fear of being chased, he considers survival horror his favorite genre. And with Resident Evil Village here, a game he's very eager to play, he's left trying to understand why he enjoys these games so much, despite his near incapability of being able to handle them. In an effort to try and understand why people, like himself, enjoy being scared and chased, he turned to clinical psychologist Dr. Ken Carter, author of the novel Buzz!: Inside the Minds of Thrill-Seekers, Daredevils, and Adrenaline Junkies.\n\nIn the above video, Dr. Ken Carter helps Kurt understand the many theories as to why people enjoy the thrill of the scare. From Freudien ideology to science, there are many reasons to explain why people enjoy being scared despite the stress it causes. Some believe it's just the adrenaline, but according to Dr. Carter, it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nHopefully you'll leave watching this video having a better understanding behind the science as to why you may love the thrill of being scared too, or maybe why you don't like horror games at all!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_diFuZ5urw", "date_published": "2021-05-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Titanfall 2's 2021 Comeback", "description": "Respawn Entertainment decided to allow free access to Titanfall 2 from April 30th to May 3rd, and suddenly, new players abound have discovered the brilliance of Titanfall 2.
