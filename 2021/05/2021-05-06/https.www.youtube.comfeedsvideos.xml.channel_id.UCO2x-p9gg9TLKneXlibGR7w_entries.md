Apple announced a new “Color Balance” feature for Apple TV in their Spring Loaded keynote. Does it work? How does it fair against professional calibration? What is color, anyways?

The new Apple TV 4K doesn’t just sport a new remote, it has a new Color Balance feature for color calibration. In a bit of a surprising move, Apple brought this feature to any Apple TV running iOS 14.5 or later. In essence, it uses the Face ID array on your iPhone to measure and analyze the color output of your TV against the baseline targets established by filmmakers and the industry: Rec.709 and Rec.2020 for HDR. The AppleTV will then modify its color output over HDMI to make your display more “color accurate.” The question is: does it really work? Is it better than just calibrating yourself? How does it compare to professional calibration? And is color really the biggest issue that your TV has? Find out this and more—as well as how color, luminance, and chromaticity/locus charts work–in this new Snazzy Labs video!
