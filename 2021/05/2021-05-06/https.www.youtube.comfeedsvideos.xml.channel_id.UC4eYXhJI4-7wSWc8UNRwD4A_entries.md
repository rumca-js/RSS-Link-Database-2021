The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

The Church Studios in North London is an institution, home to some of the most iconic records of the last three decades, including Eurythmics' Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) and Adele's 25. From the hallowed Neve Room, Moses Boyd and his band remind us that the U.K. jazz scene still bangs. They also remind us that COVID-19 regulations are much stricter across the pond: physical distancing is the name of the game in this at home concert.

The set begins with "Stranger Than Fiction," a bouncy grime tune that features saxophonist Quinn Oulton, whose pedals lend his horn a dark and haunting quality. Boyd humbly introduces the band and slips right into "2 Far Gone," and we get a chance to sink our teeth into his virtuosic drumming. Dynamic, at times explosive, and always tasteful, he lays down a bed of rhythm that gives keyboardist Renato Paris and guitarist Artie Zaitz plenty of room to shine. Then it's dancing time! "BTB" is a funky Afrobeat tune with an infectious melody that serves as the perfect closer.

It may at first seem that Negativland's sound collage is an unlikely candidate for a Tiny Desk concert, but honestly, how many bands can you think of making music since the late 1970s while sitting pretty much at their desks? Formed in the Bay Area, Negativland are proud subverters of culture, causing trouble while having fun.

The found sounds of Negativland come from original members David Wills, Mark Hosler, and Jon Leidecker (from left to right on the bottom of the screen), with visuals by Kevin Slagle and Sue Slagle (top of the screen).

Negativland are provocateurs, taking aim at the media and how technology alters our perception of the world. You can hear that on their 2020 album, The World Will Decide. This Tiny Desk (home) concert looks frightfully similar to the way many of us work these days — on video conference calls, reacting in real-time to our colleagues, dissecting our interactions ... but also occasionally having fun.

SET LIST
 • "It's Normal"
 • "No Brain"
 • "Reality Game"
 • "I'm Going To Sing Now"

MUSICIANS
 • Music and found sounds by Negativland, David Wills, Mark Hosler, and Jon Leidecker
