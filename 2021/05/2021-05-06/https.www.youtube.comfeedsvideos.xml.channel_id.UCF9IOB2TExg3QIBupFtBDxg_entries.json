workers (HCWs) are vulnerable to getting infected withSARS-CoV-2\n\nPreventing HCWs from getting infected is a priority to maintain healthcare services\n\nThe therapeutic and preventive role of ivermectin in COVID-19 is being investigated\n\nBased on promising results of in vitro studies of oral ivermectin, \n\nthis study to look at prophylactic role of oral ivermectin\n\nMethods\n\nProspective cohort study was conducted at AIIMS Bhubaneswar\n\nTwo-doses of oral ivermectin, 300 \u03bcg/kg at a gap of 72 hours\n\nPrimary outcome, COVID-19 infection in the month following\n\nOf 3892 employees, \n\n3532 (90.8%) participated in the study\n\nIvermectin uptake n = 2, 384 (67.5%) \n\nNon uptake, n = 1147 (32.5%)\n\nResults\n\nDevelopment of symptomatic infection \n\n331 participants, developed symptoms\n\n131 in takers\n\n200 from non takers\n\nIvermectin takers, 6%\n\nNon takers, 15%\n\nTesting positive, 201\n\nIvermectin takers, 2%\n\nNon takers, 11.7%\n\nImplications for transmission\n\nHCWs who had taken two-doses\n\n(Single dose did not reach significance)\n\nSignificantly lower risk of contracting COVID-19 disease during the following month was 0.18\n\nAdjusted Relative Risk 0.17\n\n1.8% reported adverse events, mild and self-limiting\n\nConclusion and relevance\n\nTwo-doses of oral ivermectin (300 \u03bcg/kg given 72 hours apart) as chemoprophylaxis among HCWs \n\nreduces the risk of COVID-19 infection by 83% in the following month.\n\nSafe, effective, and low-cost chemoprophylaxis have relevance in the containment of pandemic\nalongside vaccine.\n\nhttps://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/aiims-study-covid-19/\n\nAIIMS Director, Gitanjali Batmanabane\n\nEarlier, at least 20 to 25 HCWs were getting infected with the virus daily. \n\nAfter the workers started taking ivermectin, the number of infection has come down to one or two per day\n\nCritique\n\nThe safety of the drug has been established by its large-scale use in the last four decades for\nvarious indications such as onchocerciasis, scabies, head lice, and other parasitic infestations\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/john.l.campbell1/\n\nhttps://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/ivermectin-isnt-a-highly-effective-drug-for-treating-covid-19-tess-lawrie/?fbclid=IwAR2ahWjmOXuMx2u6FKgF9wTCESwHtN9EXKiKsTWCOoAygBb_P5thfAyOilA",
