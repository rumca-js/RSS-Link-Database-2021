If you’re a seasoned Resident Evil player, then you should consider playing on Hardcore difficulty for your first Resident Evil Village playthrough.

As someone who plays way too much Resident Evil and knows all the series’ tricks, one of the few issues I had with RE Village was that I thought it was a bit too easy on Standard mode, and it's easy to feel a little too comfortable while playing. Hardcore demands you learn and master the game, weigh the cost benefit of crafting, scavenge everything, and make every bullet count. If a bit of an uphill struggle is the kind of experience your looking for out of a Resident Evil game, you can’t go wrong with Hardcore.

Resident Evil Village isn’t your average horror game. Managing your resources, knowing how to fight, and how to make money are all important to your survival. If you’re new to the genre, this is the survival guide for you.

In this video, veteran survival horror player and Resident Evil aficionado, Kurt Indovina, shares some vital tips and tricks in order to ensure your survival in Resident Evil Village. If you’ve spent some time in the shoes of Leon Kennedy, blasting your way through the Los Plagas-controlled villagers of Resident Evil 4, then you should have no problem adapting to Village’s combat, inventory management, treasure hunting, and merchant. But if you’re new to the franchise, it can be a lot to take in. 

Kurt breaks it down into three categories: combat, exploration, and the Duke.  Kurt gives tips on fighting the game's werewolf-like enemies, Lycans, how to look for treasure, the importance of hunting animals, killing crows for pocket change, and best practices when selling your loot as well as upgrading your weapons. While it’s easy to be distracted by Lady Dimitrescu’s empowering demeanor, don’t be fooled, there’s plenty more the game offers in terms of frights and thrills to pay attention too.

While Village takes a lot of cues from its previous installment Resident Evil 7, the many environments of the game can be far more daunting than the Baker house Ethan Winters slithered through all those years back. In Resident Evil Village, Ethan must rescue his daughter Rose from the grasp of Mother Miranda, and it's up to you as the player to be prepared for the dangers that await.

Being stalked and pursued is a trope that's deeply rooted into the survival horror genre, and has been since the first Clock Tower in 1995. But it wasn't until Resident Evil 3: Nemesis that it became a staple in the long running franchise. Since Nemesis' debut in 3, players have been chased and terrorized by likes of Mr. X in the RE2 Remake, RE7's Jack Baker, RE6's Ustanak, and now the ever-adored Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village--and they're all equally very stressful and horrifying. 

Kurt Indovina gets scared very, very easily. Yet, in spite of his trembling fear of being chased, he considers survival horror his favorite genre. And with Resident Evil Village here, a game he's very eager to play, he's left trying to understand why he enjoys these games so much, despite his near incapability of being able to handle them. In an effort to try and understand why people, like himself, enjoy being scared and chased, he turned to clinical psychologist Dr. Ken Carter, author of the novel Buzz!: Inside the Minds of Thrill-Seekers, Daredevils, and Adrenaline Junkies.

In the above video, Dr. Ken Carter helps Kurt understand the many theories as to why people enjoy the thrill of the scare. From Freudien ideology to science, there are many reasons to explain why people enjoy being scared despite the stress it causes. Some believe it's just the adrenaline, but according to Dr. Carter, it's a little more complicated than that.

Hopefully you'll leave watching this video having a better understanding behind the science as to why you may love the thrill of being scared too, or maybe why you don't like horror games at all!
