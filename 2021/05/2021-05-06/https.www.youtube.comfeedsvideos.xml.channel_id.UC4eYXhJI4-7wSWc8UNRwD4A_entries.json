Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nNikki Birch | May 7, 2021\nThe Church Studios in North London is an institution, home to some of the most iconic records of the last three decades, including Eurythmics'\u00a0Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\u00a0and Adele's\u00a025. From the hallowed Neve Room, Moses Boyd and his band remind us that the U.K. jazz scene still bangs. They also remind us that COVID-19 regulations are much stricter across the pond: physical distancing is the name of the game in this at home concert.\n\nThe set begins with \"Stranger Than Fiction,\" a bouncy grime tune that features saxophonist Quinn Oulton, whose pedals lend his horn a dark and haunting quality. Boyd humbly introduces the band and slips right into \"2 Far Gone,\" and we get a chance to sink our teeth into his virtuosic drumming. Dynamic, at times explosive, and always tasteful, he lays down a bed of rhythm that gives keyboardist Renato Paris and guitarist Artie Zaitz plenty of room to shine. Then it's dancing time! \"BTB\" is a funky Afrobeat tune with an infectious melody that serves as the perfect closer.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Stranger Than Fiction\"\n \u2022 \"2 Far Gone\"\n \u2022 \"BTB\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Moses Boyd: Drums\n \u2022 Artie Zaitz: Guitar\n \u2022 Renato Paris: Synths\n \u2022 Quinn Oulton: Tenor Saxophone, Electronics\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Adam Grant, James Topham, Josiane M.H Pozi\n \u2022 Audio: Luke Pickering\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Nikki Birch\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Bob Boilen\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#mosesboyd #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m26N10wCwss", "date_published": "2021-05-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Negativland: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

Formed in the Bay Area, Negativland are proud subverters of culture, causing trouble while having fun.\n\nThe found sounds of Negativland come from original members David Wills, Mark Hosler, and Jon Leidecker (from left to right on the bottom of the screen), with visuals by Kevin Slagle and Sue Slagle (top of the screen).\n\nNegativland are provocateurs, taking aim at the media and how technology alters our perception of the world. You can hear that on their 2020 album,\u00a0The World Will Decide.\u00a0This Tiny Desk (home) concert looks frightfully similar to the way many of us work these days \u2014 on video conference calls, reacting in real-time to our colleagues, dissecting our interactions ... but also occasionally having fun.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"It's Normal\"\n \u2022 \"No Brain\"\n \u2022 \"Reality Game\"\n \u2022 \"I'm Going To Sing Now\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Music and found sounds by Negativland, David Wills, Mark Hosler, and Jon Leidecker\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Visuals by SUE-C & Co., Kevin Slagle and Sue Slagle\n \u2022 Production and A/V traffic control by Jennifer Bennett\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Bob Boilen\n \u2022 Video Producer: Kara Frame\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#negativland #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CajCimN0hf8", "date_published": "2021-05-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
