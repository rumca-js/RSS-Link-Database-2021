There are new boards in town. The Compute Module 4 ecosystem is expanding at a rapid pace, and I don't even have time to cover all the new projects I've found!

The three I cover in this video include:

  - CM4 NAS by mebs_t: https://github.com/mebs/CM4-NAS
  - Piunora by Diodes Delight: https://www.crowdsupply.com/diodes-delight/piunora
  - Seaberry by Alftel: https://www.crowdsupply.com/alftel-systems/seaberry-pi-cm4-carrier-board

And take a peek at _all_ the various CM4 boards and projects I'm tracking on the Pi PCI Express Card website: https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/boards_cm
