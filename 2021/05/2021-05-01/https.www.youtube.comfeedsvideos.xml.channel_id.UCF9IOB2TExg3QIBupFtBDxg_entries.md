Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the prepandemic period in Italy

Presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies

Blood samples of 959 asymptomatic individuals enrolled in a prospective lung cancer screening trial

Italy's first two cases of COVID-19 disease

January 30, 2020, two tourists from China in Rome

First laboratory-confirmed Italian COVID-19 case, Lombardy on February 20, 2020,

September 2019 to March 2020

SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies were detected in 111 of 959 (11.6%) individuals

IgM and some IgG

September 2019,  23/111

October,    27/111

November,   26/111

December,   11/111

January,    3/111

February,   21/111

Unexpected very early circulation of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals in Italy

At least one SARS-CoV-2–positive patient was detected in 13 regions

IgM antibodies were detected in 97 (10.1%) patients

IgG antibodies were found in 16 (1.7%)

All the patients were asymptomatic at the time of
blood sample collection.

First IgM detected 3rd September


Infection more widespread than believed

Therefore an overestimation of the mortality rate

Since November to December 2019

Many general practitioners began reporting severe respiratory symptoms in elderly
and frail people

Atypical bilateral bronchitis

(? organising pneumonia)

Attributed to aggressive forms of seasonal influenza.

Antibody Persistence through 6 Months after the Second Dose of mRNA-1273 Vaccine for Covid-19

Moderna mRNA-1273 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 

Efficacy 94% in phase 3 trials

Durability of protection, 180 days after 2nd dose

Antibody activity remained high in all age groups at day 209

Results are consistent with convalescent patients with Covid-19 through 8 months after symptom onset 

Support the use of this vaccine in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic.

How is the situation in India now, are you seeing a lot of cases?

How is the death rate, are there a lot of deaths, now and in the past weeks?

What is the causes of deaths in COVID patients, is it mostly respiratory failure?

Have you had difficulties with supplies of oxygen and drugs?

What are the local drivers of infection, are people flowing mask wearing and social distancing?

Are you able to test all of the patients you suspect have COVID?

How are you treating patients with mild and more severe disease?

What drugs do you use in addition to steroids?

Is ivermectin effective to treat COVID?

Do many patients develop secondary bacterial infection after COVID?

Do you think many people might develop long covid with longer term sequala?

Prof Jonathan Van-Tam

If two people who both had two doses of vaccine, 

and have both served at least 14 days after their second dose, 

then I would be highly confident scientifically that if they were reputable vaccines then 
indeed it would be incredibly safe for those two people to meet

Paul Hunter, Professor of Medicine, University of East Anglia

True just now with B117

The issue is variants with escape mutations that are less affected by the vaccine, 
and we haven't come to clear understanding of what those risks are
