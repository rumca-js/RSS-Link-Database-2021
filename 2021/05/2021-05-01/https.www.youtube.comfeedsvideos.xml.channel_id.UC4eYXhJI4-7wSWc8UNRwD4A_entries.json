Our showcase featured four artists who honored their homes and celebrated the art their heritage has inspired.\n\nLaTesha Harris | May 2, 2021\n\"I feel that we are living in a crazy moment in a crazy time and music has been a safe place for me \u2014 the only safe place for me,\" Luedji Luna says in a low, alluring voice as she explains the purpose of her latest album, Bom Mesmo \u00c9 Estar Debaixo D'\u00c1gua. The album, much like the Brazillian singer-songwriters's Tiny Desk performance, is a respite from these times. Elements of jazz and blues are infused with African rhythms as Luna uses music to express her ongoing struggles for autonomy as a Black woman. She performs from her coastal hometown of Bahia in the city of Salvador, Brazil, where African culture flows in abundance. Luna is a powerhouse, entrancing and elegant, soulful and spiritual, as she uses her platform to discuss individual and systemic forms of anti-Blackness.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Len\u00e7ois\"\n\"Erro\"\n\"Choror\u00f4\"\nMUSICIANS\n\nLuedji Luna: vocals\nWeslei Rodrigo: bass\nSergio Machado: drums\nGabriel Gaiardo: keys\nVinicius Sampaio: guitar\nCREDITS\n\nVideo: Flow Creative Core, Aline Juliet, Kadu Borges, Dilson Laguna\nAudio: Andr\u00e9 Ramos\nScenographer: Juliana Laguna\nExecutive Producer: Gabriel Ramos\nAssistant Producer: Reginaldo Vilela\nTINY DESK TEAM\n\nProducer: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM_ARaGik3o", "date_published": "2021-05-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK: NENNY", "description": "Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK was the opening event of AFROPUNK's \"Black Spring\" festival.

Dressed in a flowy, all-white outfit accented with a pastel checker pattern and surrounded by a matching four-piece band, the 18-year-old Portuguese singer-songwriter and rapper appears otherworldly, almost heavenly, as she harmonizes with her backing electric guitar and jumps across the room, dancing with her entire body. NENNY first appeared on heads' radar in 2019 with her single \"Sushi.\" She's continued to impress with several more singles and the release of her debut project, 2020's Aura.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"B\u00fassola\"\n\"Wave\"\n\"Tequila\"\nMUSICIANS\n\nNENNY: vocals\nGui Salgueiro: keys\nJonatas: guitar\nPeterson: bass\nAriel: drums\nCREDITS\n\nVideo: Maus da Fita, Jo\u00e3o Afonso Vaz and Andr\u00e9 Mendes\nAudio: Bruno Lobato, Charlie Beats, Tiago Poeiras\nTINY DESK TEAM\n\nProducer: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdqnNo1mqko", "date_published": "2021-05-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
