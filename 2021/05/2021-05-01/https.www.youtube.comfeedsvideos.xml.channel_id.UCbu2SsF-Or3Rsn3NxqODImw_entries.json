There's no shortage of lore in the series\u2014it's incredibly dense with it\u2014so if you're new to Mass Effect, here's a primer to get you started. Or, if you're a veteran fan, a way to refresh your memory before you play the remaster.\n\nIn the above video, Jordan Ram\u00e9e discusses the fascinating history of the ferocious Krogan: a species bred for war. From the unusual anatomy that makes them almost impossible to kill to their warmongering nature, the Krogan are regarded as the brutes of the galaxy, always spoiling for a fight.\n\nTheir nature made them very useful to the Citadel Council when faced with the Rachni, a species threatening to conquer the galaxy. Unfortunately, the Krogan ran rampant, conquering numerous planets and breeding faster than they could be killed. The solution: a genetic mutation called the Genophage, which was designed to cut birth rates among Krogan dramatically in order to keep them in check.\n\nThe Genophage plays a huge role throughout the Mass Effect trilogy and informs some of the biggest decisions the player has to make throughout the games.
