to COVID-19: evidence from a quasi-experimental analysis based on a public intervention in Mexico City\n\nhttps://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r93g4/\n\nCase study: Policy intervention in Mexico City\n\nIncrease in COVID-19 cases and with critical levels of hospital saturation during December 2020\n\nMexico City Government decided to expand population-based health\nInterventions\n\nImplementation of a prehospital home-care program\n\nCombining early detection with antigen tests\n\n230 kiosks\n\nPhone-based follow up for positive patients\n\nSince 28 December, 2020, medical ivermectin kits have been provided to positive mild to moderate symptomatic patients\n\nDyspnea, chest pain or cyanosis, referred to a hospital\n\nIvermectin, four 6mg tablets, two pills for two days\n\nAfter one month, 83,000 medical kits delivered\n\nDetailed data was collected on the evolution of patient illnesses\n\nQuasi-experimental evaluation of the effects of the medical kits on\nhospitalization\n\nKit receivers and non-kit receivers\n\nMatched observations, adjusting by age, sex, COVID severity, and comorbidities\n\nControls, N = 156,468 patients with COVID-19 infection before implementing the ivermectin program\n\nExperimental group, n = 77,381 after the implementation\n\nOutcome variable: whether or not the person was hospitalized\n\nResults\n\nNegative and significant effect of the ivermectin-based medical kit on\nthe probability of hospitalization\n\nEffect ranges from 50% to 76% \n\nDifference in hospitalization odds between treated and untreated patients, statistically significant in all cases\n\nAs expected, the effect of the medical kits is higher and stronger among males, in older patients, and in cases without severe symptoms\n\nDiscussion and limitations\n\nwe found that the medical kit given en masse to patients who\u2019d tested positive in Mexico City had a negative, significant, and robust effect on their odds of being hospitalized. \n\nIndependently of the medical telephone follow, level of hospital occupancy, specific period of time\n\nSimilar trend, Per\u00fa (Chamie-Quintero Et Al, 2021). \n\nPrincipal mechanisms, reduction of viral load, in the patients that take ivermectin in early stages of the disease\n\nChamie-Quintero Et Al, 2021, Peru\n\nhttps://osf.io/9egh4\n\n25 states of Peru\n\nGrouped by extent of IVM distributions\n\nMaximal, medium, minimal\n\nReductions in excess deaths (30 days after peak deaths)\n\nmaximal, 74%\nmedium, 53%\nminimal, 25%\n\nReduction of excess deaths is correlated with extent of IVM distribution by state p less than 0.002\n\nThis strongly suggests that IVM treatments can likewise effectively complement immunizations to help eradicate COVID-19. \n\nThe indicated biological mechanism of IVM, \n\ncompetitive binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, \n\nis likely non-epitope specific, \n\npossibly yielding full efficacy against emerging viral mutant strains.\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-government-says-ivermectin-helped-to-keep-deaths-low-7311786/\n\nUttar Pradesh government,

a high population density, we have maintained a relatively low positivity rate and cases per million of population\n\nLower positivity and fatality rates may be attributed to the large-scale use of
