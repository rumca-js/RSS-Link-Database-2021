In this video Tamoor, Jean-Luc, Lucy, and AbleGamers' Steve Spohn discuss some of the things we can reasonably expect to see at the show, including Halo: Infinite, which is pretty much a dead cert for the Microsoft and Bethesda showcase. The team has a little fun with the prediction and try and come up with fun crossover opportunities they'd like to see. \n\nOn top of that, there's the potential to see Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, but then again WB may be saving those for its DC Fandom event. For Square Enix's part, the next entry in the Final Fantasy series could make its return to the press conference stage. Other games the team would love to see are the Dragon Age and, if the announcement gods will it, the next Mass Effect. \n\nTamoor, Jean-Luc, Lucy, and Steve also throw out some of their fantasy picks for what they want to see, which includes some expected but also very unexpected picks.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_oClUXWwHI", "date_published": "2021-06-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Can Dark Souls Help Your Mental Health? | MindGames", "description": "During the pandemic more people have been playing games than ever before, but while it's easy to think gamers are gravitating towards the likes of Animal Crossing or Minecraft, many people instead turn to intense, difficult games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne for comfort.\n\nAlexander Kriss, psychotherapist and author of 'The Gaming Mind', explains the science of how games help people's mental health, and why playing stressful games during a global pandemic might be a good thing.\n\nThe Gaming Mind by Alexander Kriss: https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Mind-Psychology-Videogames-Power/dp/1615196811?tag=gs-buybutton-20\nTheHappyHob's Soulsborne No-Hit Run: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG-AtY0Nm44\nDistortion2 Opening the locked door: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKt_C7RfaqQ\nOtzdarva's DS2 No-Hit Run Attempts: https://youtu.be/1igv3qUtHXg\nVaatiVidya's Prepare to Cry - Artorias the Abysswalker: https://youtu.be/Ag60ZF-IdKk\nRKG Beating Dark Souls on a Transatlantic Flight: https://youtu.be/m7FPI1p-A00", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dXjBhPB4t0", "date_published": "2021-05-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "NVIDIA Keynote Livestream", "description": "Learn more about what's next for NVIDIA at their keynote at Computex 2021.
