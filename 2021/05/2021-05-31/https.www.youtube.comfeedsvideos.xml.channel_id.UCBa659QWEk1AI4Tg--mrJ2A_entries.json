That story's been told many times: but I found something in the archives that I don't think anyone's ever noticed before.\n\nThanks to the boat crew and voice artists!\nLocation fixer: Vikki McCraw at Locations 365 http://www.locations365.co.uk/\n\nSOURCES from the National Archives:\nWO 188/2783\nWO 188/3169\nWO 32/20442\nDEFE 55/118\nDEFE 68/991, 992, 993\n\nOne other stories I found but couldn't fit into the video: the government spent a long time trying to work out the legal ramifications of selling the island back. In the end, they agreed to guarantee the cleanup for 150 years, which to me is the strongest evidence that there's nothing dangerous left there: they wouldn't have taken that risk otherwise!\n\nFilmed safely: https://www.tomscott.com/safe/\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\r\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\r\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\r\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suAC_PDP3Sk", "date_published": "2021-05-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
