From their early lives growing up in the Shire, to reclaiming their home from Saruman, we cover the complete lives and travels of Merry and Pippin!  These heroic hobbits would grow into not only be the tallest hobbits of all time, but also the most militarily accomplished.  They would hold great leadership roles in their post-war days living in The Shire.  Finally, in their last days, they would make one last trip to Rohan and Gondor.
