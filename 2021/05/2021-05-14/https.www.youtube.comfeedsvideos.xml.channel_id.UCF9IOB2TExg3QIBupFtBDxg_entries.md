International spread, B.1.617.2

Vaccines are almost certainly less effective at reducing transmission of the Indian variant

The vaccines may be less effective against mild disease

but we don't think they're less effective against severe disease

all the evidence so far suggests there is no evidence of increased severity of illness or that the variant evades the vaccine

SAGE, now confident it is more transmissible than existing variants

Not sure how much

Prof Chris Whitty

That's a really critical question to which we do not yet have the answer

SAGE, realistic possibility it could be 50%

Probably will become the dominant strain in the UK

Outbreak, south Glasgow

Scotland, 35

Northern Ireland, 12

Wales, 11

R rate

England 0.8 – 1.1

Wales, 0.7 – 1

Scotland, 0.8 – 1.0

NI, 0.8 – 1.1

There are now multiple fast-growing clusters of this variant in the UK

Largest in the northwest of England

Observed doubling times are around a week

Places where transmission of this variant is occurring have different characteristics to each other

Plausible biological reasons as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible

In the areas where numbers of infections are increasing rapidly under the measures currently in place, 
an even faster increase can be expected if measures are relaxed (high confidence)

If this variant were to have a 40-50% transmission advantage nationally compared to B.1.1.7, 
indicate that it is likely that progressing with step 3 alone would lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations (similar to, or larger than, previous peaks)

Progressing with both steps 3 and 4 at the earliest dates could lead to a much larger peak

SAGE and immune escape

May be some reduction in protection given by vaccines or by naturally acquired immunity from past infection,

though data on this are still mixed. 

Any such reduction is likely to affect protection against infection more than protection against severe disease or death

not yet any clear evidence of any difference in disease severity following infection with this variant

(rapid sequencing of hospitalised cases and infections post vaccination is important)

JCVI continues to review the evidence on different vaccination strategies.

Department of Health and Social Care 

Ministers cannot rule out re-imposing economic and social restrictions at a local or regional level if evidence suggests they are necessary to contain or suppress a variant which escapes the vaccine

Regional restrictions possible

Surge testing in 15 areas across England

Cluster areas, increased genome sequencing

Bringing forward second vaccine for people who are eligible

Prime Minister

It is a variant of concern, we are anxious about it

CDC, 13th May

If you’ve been fully vaccinated:

resume activities that you did prior to the pandemic

resume activities without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart, 

except where required locally

Domestic travel, do not need tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after

do NOT need to get tested before leaving the United States unless your destination requires it.

still need a negative test or evidence of recovery before boarding an international flight to the United States

should still get tested 3-5 days after international travel

do NOT need to self-quarantine after arriving in the United States.

If you’ve been around someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms

Except, correctional, detention facility or a homeless shelter

For now, if you’ve been fully vaccinated:

follow guidance at your workplace and local businesses

Masks on planes, buses, trains, domestic and international

International arrivals, test within 3 days

Test and stay at home is symptomatic

Weaken immune system, talk to their healthcare provider

Single-center, retrospective cohort study, Tel Aviv

Data were collected on symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections confirmed via polymerase chain reaction

N = 6,710 health care workers

Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection

Incidence rate fully vaccinated = 4.7 per 100,000 days

Incidence rate unvaccinated = 149.8 per 100,000 days

97% protection

Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection

Incidence rate fully vaccinated = 11.3 per 100,000 days

Incidence rate unvaccinated  = 67 per 100,000 days

86% protection

This refusal represents for us a serious threat to public health
