The instructors humbly maintain that they are students themselves, dedicated to improving their dance so that they can share more with others. They take their art and their jobs very seriously and appreciate everyone who entrusts their learning with them.\n\nKoo Koo Kanga Roo \u2014 Koo Koo Kanga Roo is a dance party of the senses. For the last 12 years, lifelong friends and collaborators Bryan and Neil have toured the globe delighting fans with their high-energy music, infectious positivity, and interactive live show. Of course, the global pandemic of 2020 threatened to put an end to the carefree fun that had come to define the band, but instead of putting the group on pause or looking for office jobs, Bryan and Neil doubled down and created their most triumphant and expansive album yet.\n\nGaelynn Lea \u2014 Gaelynn Lea won NPR Music's Tiny Desk Contest in 2016, and not long after she hit the road with her husband Paul. So far she has toured in 45 states and 9 countries, captivating audiences around the world with her unique mix of haunting original songs and traditional fiddle tunes. In addition to performing and recording, Gaelynn also does speaking engagements about Disability Rights, finding inner freedom, and accessibility in the arts. She uses her music as a platform to advocate for disabled people and to promote positive social change. She is currently working on a memoir about her touring adventures and disability advocacy that she plans to release in 2022.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thecurrent #rockthecradle", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNcMpLwFO-A", "date_published": "2021-05-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
