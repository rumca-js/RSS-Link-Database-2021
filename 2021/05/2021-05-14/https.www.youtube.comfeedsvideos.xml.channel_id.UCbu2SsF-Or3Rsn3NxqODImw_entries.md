With leaks and rumors flying around the anticipated release of Battlefield 6, such as massive destruction, extreme weather events, and massive player count, it's time to go back to Battlefield 3, 4, and Bad Company 2 to see how these mechanics have played out in the past and if they are good or bad ideas in a next-gen title. 

Battlefield 6 is confirmed to release sometime between October and December this year. It's scheduled to be revealed in June, and we'll likely get a more in-depth look during EA Play on July 22. There have been a number of leaks and rumors lately such as the next game having highly destructible cities, extreme weather events, giant rockets, Osprey aircraft, and a near-future setting that includes drones and Boston Dynamics robots. While we can't currently confirm any of this, what we can do is go back to older Battlefield titles set in modern times to see if these ideas could be good or bad for the series.
It's hard to believe that it's been seven years since the last DLC, Final Stand, dropped for a contemporary Battlefield. In this video, we're going back to Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and even Hardline to see what parts of those games could be built on for the next game and what ideas should not be included.

There have been more recent announcements from an investor call including the fact that Battlefield 6 will be on last-gen consoles as well as the current PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The investor call also included revelations such as the next-gen versions of the game potentially having higher player counts, more advanced physics, and more destruction. Battlefield 6 is currently being worked on by four studios including DICE, DICE LA, Criterion, and EA Gothenburg. Stay close to GameSpot for incoming announcements on the next Battlefield game.

Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is finally here, giving both newcomers to the series and longtime fans a way to experience developer BioWare's acclaimed action-RPG trilogy with remastered visuals and quality of life improvements. 

The video above is an excerpt of episode 93 of the GameSpot After Dark podcast, in which Jean-Luc Seipke, Tamoor Hussain, Lucy James, and Jordan Ramée all get together to discuss their early impressions of Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. Don't worry, the crew doesn't go into story spoilers--the conversation sticks to analyzing developer BioWare's adjustments to the trilogy, specifically Mass Effect 1.

Most of the big changes in Legendary Edition's Mass Effect 1 are to the game's combat. Though it still doesn't quite match its two sequels in terms of shooting mechanics and squad management, the remaster still  introduces quite a few welcome adjustments for the 14 year old game, which makes it much more approachable by modern day standards. If the combat was putting you off from trying the game before, it'd be wise to give it an earnest playthrough with the Legendary Edition.

Beyond combat, the Legendary Edition also improves Mass Effect 1's load times and enhances the visuals with higher resolutions, improved assets, and better frame rates. Most of the adjustments to environments, lighting, and visual style seem to be made with the intent of better aligning Mass Effect 1's visuals with that of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, for better and for worse. When it comes to characters, the remaster has done wonders with adding additional detail to its alien characters, though not all humans look as good. They're very...shiny.

Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is available for Xbox One, PS4, and PC. The remaster can be played on Xbox Series X|S and PS5 via backwards compatibility as well.
