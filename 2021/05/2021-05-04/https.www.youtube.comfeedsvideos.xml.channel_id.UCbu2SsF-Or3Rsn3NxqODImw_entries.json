The game balances various mechanics and approaches to storytelling, which certainly make for an enticing take on a post-apocalyptic adventure game. \n\nDescribed as a \"post-apocalyptic kung-fu fable,\" the action and storytelling on display in Biomutant present an adventure that's an intriguing mix of the classic animated film Secret of Nimh, along with the platforming and action of games like Enslaved: Odyssey To The West and Devil May Cry. And therein lies the hook for Biomutant; it wears its weirdness on its sleeve, presenting an alluring take on what the post-apocalyptic Earth would look like once the animals inherit the world.\n\nIn our preview, we got a clearer sense of the game's focus on action and storytelling, and how the hero's journey will evolve in a world full of talking animals and decaying automatons. First revealed back in 2017, Biomutant is the debut game from Experiment 101, made up of former developers from the Just Cause series. Biomutant is a departure from that particular series, which instead focuses more on exploring a Zelda-like map with action-RPG mechanics that blend third-person combat and RPG-like progression.\u00a0\n\nBiomutant releases for PS4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25th.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjXqDTETjqM", "date_published": "2021-05-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Resident Evil Village Video Review", "description": "The sequel to Resident Evil 7 leans heavily on Resident Evil 4's brand of action, but adds its own sensibilities to the mix.\n\nPhil Hornshaw scoured the ramshackle houses and strange environs of Resident Evil Village for about 12 hours on PlayStation 5, which included blasting off quite a few lycan heads in The Mercenaries.

Another advantage of the PS5 version is ray tracing, which is absent from the PS4 version.\u00a0\n\nDespite ray tracing and load times, however, Resident Evil Village is an impressive visual feat that manages to look and run very well on previous gen hardware. So fear not, PS4 owners, Lady Dimitrescu will still stalk and prey on you in all of her tall and menacing glory all the same from the looks of this comparison.\u00a0\n\nIt won\u2019t be long until we step into the shoes of Resident Evil 7\u2019s protagonist, Ethan Winters, once again in the search for his daughter Rose. The demo, which featured a segment of the village and Lady Dimitrescu\u2019s castle, still leaves many questions to be answered, like Chris Redfield\u2019s involvement and why he murdered Ethan\u2019s wife Mia. It also remains unclear whether or not Lady Dimitrescu is the main villain, and who exactly Mother Miranda is.\n\nResident Evil Village is taking clear inspiration from one of the franchises most beloved installments Resident Evil 4, which also prominently featured a village and gothic-like horror. There are several other notable similarities like the return of a tetris-like inventory system, a merchant, and weapon upgrade systems.\n\nResident Evil Village is a direct sequel to Resident Evil 7.
