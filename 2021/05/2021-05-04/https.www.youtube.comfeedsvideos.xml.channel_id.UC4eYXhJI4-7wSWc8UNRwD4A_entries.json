Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nFelix Contreras | May 5, 2021\nI'm a little envious of those of you about to press play on this Tiny Desk (home) concert. The first time I heard this Argentine duo was love at first sight.\n\nVocalist and upright bassist Cande Buasso and keyboardist Paulo Carrizo are from San Juan, Argentina, a very small town nestled by the Andes close to Chile. I like to imagine that the secluded location contributes to the magic and nuance of the very personal musical language the two have developed since forming the duo in 2017.\n\nThings kick off with the magic turned up to 11 with Leonard Cohen's \"Treaty,\" from 2016's\u00a0You Want It Darker. The duo's introduction to the world was a heartbreaking YouTube performance of \"Barro Tal Vez\" by the Argentine rocker and songwriter Luis Alberto Spinetta, and their performance of it here is no less haunting and captivating.\n\n\"Limite En Tu Amor,\" a cover of Feist's \"Limit To Your Love,\" is a preview of one of the tracks that will be included on their upcoming album of covers, produced by Grammy-winning producer Larry Klein. And they seal the deal with \"Tuyo,\" a nod to one of the most unheralded singer-songwriters in Latin America, Rodrigo Amarante of Brazil. Tuyo translates to \"yours\" and it's a fitting close to the briefest of introductions, but one strong enough to make Cande y Paulo one of our favorite discoveries of 2021.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Treaty\"\n \u2022 \"Barro Tal Vez\"\n \u2022 \"Limite En Tu Amor\"\n \u2022 \"Tuyo\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Cande Buasso: vocals, double bass\n \u2022 Paulo Carrizo: keys, piano & production\n \u2022 Santiago Molina: drums\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Guillermo Cabrera, Adri\u00e1n Arroyo, Agust\u00edn Arroyo and Oscar D\u00edaz\n \u2022 Audio: Guillermo Barros\n \u2022 Filmed at Teatro Del Bicentenario, San Juan, Argentina\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Felix Contreras\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #candeypaulo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoxKkGpRbtk", "date_published": "2021-05-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
