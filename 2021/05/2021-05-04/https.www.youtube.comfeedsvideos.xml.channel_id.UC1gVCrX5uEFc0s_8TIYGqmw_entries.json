It was filmed at the Majestic Studio in Los Angeles.\n\nCharlie and his boss have difficulties just getting to the house they are going to wallpaper. The householder is angry because he can't get breakfast and his wife is screaming at the maid as they arrive. The kitchen gas stove explodes, and Charlie offers to fix it. The wife's secret lover arrives and is passed off as the workers' supervisor, but the husband doesn't buy this and fires shots. The stove explodes violently, destroying the house.\n\nIMDB:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(film%29\nWikipedia:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006313/\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
