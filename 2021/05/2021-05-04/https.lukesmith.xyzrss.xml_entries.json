Suppose you have a person pick a card\nand say you will guess the suit of their card.</p>\n<p>They pick a diamond card and announce it, and you tell them to check\nunderneath their chair to reveal a slip of paper that says, &quot;You will\npick a diamond card.&quot;</p>\n<p>That might sound like a nice trick, but if they had picked a spade, you\nhave another piece of paper under the fruitbowl that says, &quot;You will\npick a spade.&quot; If they pick a club, you unbutton your shirt to reveal a\ngiant club written on your undershirt, etc.</p>\n<p>In essence, for any possible outcomes, you have a response planned that\nseems natural and predictive. This is one of the ways that magicians do\nwhat they do, often with more complicated mechanisms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"applications\">Applications</h2>\n<p>Multiple outs are actually real magic.</p>\n<p>You've heard the expression &quot;hope for the best and plan for the\nworst,&quot; but the concept of multiple outs is that one should be planning\nfor <em>all possible</em> outcomes, including those that you yourself might not\neven anticipate now.</p>\n<p>Every business plan should have multiple outs. Your major life decisions\nshould be planned with multiple outs. You should even tacitly plan dates\nwith multiple outs, so that unexpected events can be met with a\nconfident, perhaps even better replacements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-outs-in-political-power\">Multiple outs in political power</h2>\n<p>Any longstanding group in political power is by the mere fact of their\nsurvival sure to have mastered the sleight of hand of &quot;multiple outs.&quot;</p>\n<p>This serves not only to continue in political power, but to cement their\npower further by the appearance of inevitability. A ruler or ruling\nclass puts themselves in a position to benefit from any possible\noccurrence: be ready even to use disaster to your benefit, as Obama's\nchief of staff Rahm Emmanuel put it succinctly: &quot;You never let a\nserious crisis go to waste.&quot;</p>\n<h3 id=\"conspiracy\">Conspiracy?</h3>\n<p>People skeptical of the state sometimes devolve into thinking that every\nmajor political event is in one way or another is planned in advance.\nThis is because they don't understand and apply the concept of multiple\nouts. They see that their rulers are good at benefiting from any chaos\nor unforeseen events, so assume these events must've been engineered.</p>\n<p>Look at the corona virus: it's a great example of an event that has\nhugely benefited a small elite: it has bankrupted small businesses in\nfavor of Amazon, destroyed churches and mom and pop stores in favor of\npassively consooming digital infotainment from curated social media\nsites and more. It is a rationalization of state location and contact\nmonitoring and things far beyond what anyone dreamed of. It was a\nrationalization for sending out unsolicited ballots to unverified voter\nrolls which had very obvious beneficiaries. It has produced a cult of\ndoomsday believers crying for the state to lock them in their houses and\nmake them wear fetishistic masks.</p>\n<p>Seeing all this and asking who benefits, &quot;Cui bono?&quot; might lead you to\nthink that the whole thing was planned: perhaps the disease itself is\nfake, or maybe it was real, but spread on purpose, or perhaps it was\nengineered. You've probably seen stuff like this, and while I won't\ndismiss this kind of thinking out of hand, it's unnecessary.</p>\n<p>In reality, the ruling classes of the West have openly prepared to\nbenefit from a pandemic scenario. COVID19 was deemed &quot;closed enough&quot;\nto a pandemic, and the momentum of the system took over. It's not even\nthat they <em>wanted it to happen</em>, but they were prepped to benefit from\nit as a contingency plan if it might occur.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-conspiracy-rabbit-hole-and-the-omnipotent-cathedral\">The Conspiracy Rabbit Hole and the Omnipotent Cathedral</h3>\n<p>There are some people who see how the ruling class is in a position to\nbenefit from every school-shooting, police encounter, foreign\nentanglement, dissident politician and everything else and thus assume\nthat everything they see must be arranged in advance. There is a logic\nbehind believing this: it does seem <em>way</em> to convenient for all of this\nto happen at what retroactively seems to the best time, but this leads\npeople to the much more uneconomical idea that the System is so\nomnipotent that it controls every event and every reaction to every\nevent.</p>\n<p>In reality, our rulers just know how to use multiple outs. When you know\nhow to do that, it seems like you are always in control, and by nature,\npeople attribute a kind of magical power to you. All you have to do is\nstay cool and play it off like you predicted it all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"this-is-why-the-system-always-seem-to-win\">This is why &quot;the System&quot; always seem to win.</h3>\n<p><strong>The system knows how to play with multiple outs.</strong></p>\n<p>There is a canned response, or at least a reasonably ad-libbed response,\nfor every event and every possible event. They are in a position of\nantifragility and can gain from nearly any possible event. When they\ncan't, the media can at least throw enough mud on public perception to\ninspire apathy or confusion.</p>\n<p>There are certainly portions of the System which are &quot;conspiratorial.&quot;\nMajor news organizations usually coordinate on what editorial line to\npublish, but in general, their entrenched power comes from a detached\nability to be flexible in new events.</p>\n<p>The omnipotence and permanence of the Soystem is illusory. It comes from\nthat flexibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-outs-in-your-life\">Multiple outs in your life</h2>\n<p>Even aside from politics, it's important to behave yourself in a way\nthat allow yourself to have multiple outs. Business, social life, major\ndecisions and in everything else. Never tether yourself to one option;\nthat's when you lose. Have a smart response to co-opt anything that can\nhappen, no matter how good or bad.</p>", "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/conspiratorial-thinking-and-multiple-outs/", "date_published": "2021-05-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["conspiracy theories"]}, {"source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "title": "The Problems with Utilitarianism", "description": "<p>I originally wrote this essay in 2014 or 2015 in a Chinese buffet in\nAthens, Georgia. I've changed some of it and am re-adding it here. I\ntalk about the issues with Utilitarianism and a bad book by Sam Harris.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"utilitarianism\">Utilitarianism</h2>\n<p>At a dumb intuitive level, the &quot;ethical&quot; idea of\n[Utilitarianism]{.dfn} in principle gets pretty close to what most\npeople reflexively want from social-political affairs: the greatest good\nfor the greatest number of people&mdash;who doesn't want that?</p>\n<p>The problem is that that intuitive idea is <em>incoherent</em>. It sounds good,\nbut there's not really such a thing as &quot;the greatest good for the\ngreatest number of people.&quot; If there were, it wouldn't even be\nactionable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"maximizing\">&quot;Maximizing&quot;</h2>\n<p>So the first problem is one any mathematician will realize right off the\nbat: it's rarely possible to maximize a function for two variables.</p>\n<p>If we had the means, we could maximize (1) the amount of good in society\nor (2) the number of people who feel that good, but nearly certainly not\nboth (if we can it's a bizarre coincidence).</p>\n<p>It's sort of like saying you want to find a house with the highest\navailable altitude and the lowest available price; the highest house\nmight not have the lowest price and vice versa, the same way the way of\nrunning society which maximizes happiness is nearly certainly not be the\nway which maximizes all individuals' happiness.</p>\n<p>There are some classic moral puzzles that bring this out: Let's say\nthere's a city where basically everyone is in absolute ecstasy, but\ntheir ecstasy can only take place if one particular person in the city\nis in intense and indescribable pain. Or to put it another way, to\nmaximize <em>my</em> happiness, we might need to make everyone in the world my\nslave and allow me to rule as I please. Although this might maximize my\nhappiness, it might not maximize anyone else's (if it does however, we\nmight want to consider it).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-well-being-of-conscious-creatures\">The Well-being of Conscious Creatures</h2>\n<p>So I recently read Sam Harris's <em>The Moral Landscape</em> which is either a\nfailed attempt to bring Utilitarianism back to life or a misguided book\nsimply ignorant of what the problems with it were. I don't actually\nrecall Harris using the term &quot;utilitarianism,&quot; although that is really\njust what he's arguing for.</p>\n<p>Harris repeats one mantra basically every paragraph of the book: &quot;the\nwell-being of conscious creatures&mdash;the well-being of conscious\ncreatures&mdash;the well-being of conscious creatures.&quot; In addition to\nbeing repetitive, the term is problematic for important reasons. So\nHarris wants our Utilitarian engineers to maximize &quot;the well-being of\nconscious creatures,&quot; but the problem is we can't <em>just add up</em>\nenjoyment in the first place. There's no way of taking my enjoyment of\ncandy, subtracting the pain of a broken nose and adding/subtracting an\nexistential crisis or two.</p>\n<p>Now his hope is eventually we'll understand the neurology of the brain\nenough to do just that. I don't take Harris for a fool, and he <em>does</em>\nhave a Ph.D. in neuroscience (obviously I am being sarcastic), but I\nthink he's ignoring all the important problems either to appeal to a\npublic audience or just to convince himself. We <em>can</em> study the\nneurology of feelings and get readings of neural activity, but objective\nneural activity is certainly not subjective experience. Twice as much\nneural activity doesn't mean &quot;twice&quot; the subjective experience.</p>\n<p>We can no better look at brain activation to understand subjective\nexperience any better than we can look at the hot parts of a computer to\nsee what it's doing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-cant-do-math-with-feelings\">You can't do math with feelings</h3>\n<p>Of course one of the problems of qualia/subjective experience is that\nthey are necessarily unquantifiable: imagine how you felt the last time\nyou got a present you really enjoyed&mdash;now imagine yourself feeling\nexactly <em>twice</em> as happy&mdash;now <em>1.5</em> times as happy&mdash;now <em>100</em> times as\nhappy.</p>\n<p>You can't do it, and even if you could, you couldn't compare that\nexperience with other experiences&mdash;you can't really understand what it\nmeans to be as happy as you were sad a month ago, and that prevents us\nfrom actually adding up your experiences into one number to be\nmaximized.</p>\n<p>But again <em>even if we could</em> it would be impossible to add that number\nup with someone else's experience. Humans have different subjective\nexperiences: caffeine affects me demonstrably different than other\npeople, but I can't quantify that; some people are more affected by\npain (to my understanding, women seem to have a neurology more\npain-prone than men), but how can we precisely relate the precise ratios\nof every individual person?</p>\n<p>And of course, although Harris wants to maximize &quot;the well-being of\n<em>conscious creatures</em>,&quot; we have no <em>clue</em> what kinds of conscious\nexperiences define animal life, or how many animals are &quot;conscious&quot; in\nany recognizable sense. As Thomas Nagel noted, we can't even begin to\nimagine what it's like to be a bat, but to quantify their experiences\nand compare them to our own? Forget about it!</p>\n<p>Douglas Adams in his <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> presented the\nidea of a genetically engineered cow which not only was made to be able\nto speak, but to enjoy the prospect of being eaten and encourage others\nto kill and eat him. Experience itself is not some kind of thing arbiter\nof morality. Pain, in fact, might be a negligible or incomplete guide to\nwhat is not good. Children have to put up with being drug around to do\nmany things they don't enjoy. That doesn't mean some immorality in\nanything.</p>\n<p>The philosophical problems here are so endless as to make any kind of\nobjective application of Utilitarianism based on neuroscience far beyond\neven fancy. I will be so bold as to say that this will simply never be\npossible, regardless of what chips Elon Musk wants to put in your brain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"to-repeat\">To repeat:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We cannot quantify any particular feeling.</li>\n<li>On top of that, we cannot compare the values of different feelings.</li>\n<li>On top of that, we certainly not weigh the subjective feelings of\nall humans or beasts against other humans' feelings.</li>\n<li>On top of that, even if we could do that, we can't maximize for\nutility in such a way to maximize all individual happiness and\ncollective happiness simultaneously.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Utilitarianism isn't just impossible, it's impossible every step of\nthe way.</p>\n<p>To be clear, these are not technological problems that a future\ntotalitarian government might be able to &quot;solve.&quot; There really is no\ncoherent sense in which we can put a number to a certain feeling of\nhappiness and subtract from that another person's feeling of\nunhappiness. Qualia are qualia. It's like subtracting the sound of an\nairplane from the color blue.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-utilitarianism-really-is\">What Utilitarianism really is</h2>\n<p>Anyway, the tradition of Utilitarianism was always a failure, but it's\nan interesting sign of the times. The Enlightenment was a time of some\n(less than usually thought) scientific advancement and the idea was that\nas we began to understand the nature of the body and the stars and\neverything else, we could fully understand too human society.</p>\n<p>Eventually we could engineer and control them all. But as fast as we\nlearn things about the world, even faster do complications arise and we\nend up &quot;[restoring nature's] ultimate secrets to that obscurity, in\nwhich they ever did and ever will remain&quot; in Hume's words.</p>\n<p>The only really unfortunate thing is that the ruling class of the West\neither doesn't know or does care. There's a cynical sense in which\nthey are attempting to re-engineer or &quot;Build Back Better\u00ae\ufe0f&quot; the world\non Utilitarian principles where every decision is determined to be\nacceptable by some centralized utilitarian calculus.</p>", "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/the-problems-with-utilitarianism/", "date_published": "2021-05-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "title": "Monero and Other Privacy Coins", "description": "<p>As I said <a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/posts/monero-maximalism-or-how-bitcoin-is-a-coin\">in other writings</a> and\n<a href=\"https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/8ba38c94-e8c2-421f-bb5f-47f4169fa804\">videos</a>,\nno serious cryptocurrency can function <strong>in real life</strong> which is not\nalso a <em>truly private</em> cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>By far, the most popular of all these is Monero, which has already\nbecome the <em>de facto</em> currency of the dark web, but also of <em>all</em>\ncryptocurrency users <em>who actually use cryptocurrency for purposes other\nthan a mere investment</em>.</p>\n<p>Monero, however, is not actually the only private or pseudo-private\ncrypto-currency, and while I talked about its competitors in a recent\nstream, I think it's worth putting in words for a reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moneros-competitors\">Monero's Competitors</h2>\n<h3 id=\"zcash-is-trash\">Zcash is Trash</h3>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/zcashy_owned.png\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/zcashy_owned_small.png\" /></a></figure>\n\n<p><strong>Optional privacy is no privacy at all.</strong></p>\n<p>Zcash (ZEC) is often shilled as a Monero replacement. On the surface it\nactually sounds great and unambiguously better: it has a clever a\nzero-knowledge proof technology called zk-SNARKs which can store and\nprove transactions in the blockchain in a private way. zk-SNARKs are\ngenerally superior to Monero's somewhat ragtag triad of ring\nsignatures + stealth addresses + ring CT to anonymize transactions and\nthey are more scalable.</p>\n<p>zk-SNARK is short for &quot;Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument\nof Knowledge.&quot;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zero Knowledge &ndash; It is private.</li>\n<li>Succinct &ndash; Referring to computation time.</li>\n<li>Non-interactive &ndash; In some earlier implementations of the\ntechnology, the interacting parties must exchange information and\nnegotiate in turns, while zk-SNARKs can occur instantaneously.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Zcash, however, has two major problems, one substantial and one\naccidental (in the Aristotelean sense).</p>\n<p>The substantial problem is that zk-SNARKs <em>are not fully trustless</em>:\nthey require a trusted setup where public parameters are generated and\nif not properly disposed of, the initial developers could use that\nknowledge to produce infinite money without anyone knowing. This sort of\ndefeats the purpose of having a decentralized cryptocurrency and while\nthe rest of the currency is decentralized, that gaping hole certainly\nisn't.</p>\n<p>The accidental problem (or maybe <em>incidental</em> problem in modern English)\nis that Zcash is only <em>optionally private</em>. The vast majority of ZEC\ntransactions are not &quot;shielded&quot; with the zk-SNARK technology, but are\nas public as a Bitcoin transaction. <strong>This allows a third-party to\nuncover the &quot;private&quot; transactions by a process of automatic process\nof elimination.</strong></p>\n<p>Zcash, while is created valuable technology, is simply not a private\ncurrency and is not a valid competitor to Monero.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pirate-chain\">Pirate Chain</h3>\n<p>Pirate Chain (ARRR) is a minor privacy coin that has mooned\nsignificantly recently popping up from 30 cents to 14 dollars or so\n(it's halved since I started writing this article though). Pirate Chain\nuses the zk-SNARK technology, but unlike Zcash, uses it mandatorily\n(with optional transparent transactions like Monero via the private view\nkey).</p>\n<p>Pirate Chain has two big issues though. The first is what I mentioned\nbefore: zk-SNARKs as they have been implemented in ZEC and ARRR are\n<strong>not trustless</strong>. They require a setup in which theoretically, if the\npublic parameters of the system were known to some inside party, they\ncould print an infinite amount of the currency with absolutely no way\nthat any other people could know.</p>\n<p>Even if you <em>trust</em> the Pirate Chain developers, Pirate has another\npretty undeniable problem: <strong>90% of ARRR has already been mined and is\nin circulation!</strong> Yep, you heard that right: A minor niche alt-coin\nwhich has existed for only three years was put together in such away\nthat now as big of a proportion of it has been mined as has been mined\nof Bitcoin in over ten years!</p>\n<p>That means that that 90% is highly aggregated in the wallets of the two\nand a half people who knew of ARRR in this period, and anyone adding to\nthe market cap is mostly just contributing to these people's bags. Even\nif Pirate Chain had great trustless technology (which is doesn't) it\nhas not been set up equitably, but in a way that enriches early adopters\nto an extreme degree. Expect to get dumped on if you buy this stuff.</p>\n<p>Honestly, if you want a better, more honest cryptocurrency, you could\njust take the Pirate setup and give it a slower and more sane emission.\nThat would be a better choice than ARRR itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"monero--dogecoin--bitcoin--wownero\">Monero + Dogecoin + Bitcoin = Wownero</h3>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/nowow.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wownero.org\">website</a> &ndash; <a href=\"https://suchwow.xyz\">meme site</a></p>\n<p>Wownero is a joke currency. It's literally a fork of Monero with\nDogecoin aesthetics and some minor additions. Like Pirate Chain, it also\nhas surged significantly recently (from 2 or 3 cents to more than a\ndollar&mdash;beating out Dogecoin as a pump-and-dump for sure).</p>\n<p>Weirdly enough, Wownero is probably the best of the alternative privacy\ncoins that I've mentioned so far. It's trustless, unlike the zk-SNARK\ncoins, but also has some nice features.</p>\n<p>It was created somewhat as a satirical response for another privacy\n\ud83d\udca9coin, MoneroV, which was just Monero with an initial coin offering and\nforked from the same blockchain (which ruins the privacy of users on\nboth chains because it becomes easier to triangulate on when outputs are\nactually spent).</p>\n<p>Since Wownero is a &quot;joke,&quot; it actually has integrated new technology\nand helpful additions <em>before</em> Monero has, since the Wownero developers\nare doing it all fast and loose. Ironically, that can be good.</p>\n<p>One principle division between Monero and Wownero is that Wownero is\nmore like Bitcoin in that it has a totally fixed supply, while Monero\nhas tail emission. Some people have criticized Monero for tail emission,\narguing that it is unnecessary and inflationary. I am not sold on either\nside: the game theoretics of this has never truly played out, but\nWownero might actually be something to look into if you like Monero, but\nthink it's &quot;inflationary.&quot; Regardless, Wownero's whitepaper and\nroadmap on their website are something that everyone should read and\ntake seriously.</p>\n<p>Again, the currency is sort of a meme, but it is what it is. I decided\nto start taking <a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/crypto.html\">Wownero donations</a> on my site a while\nago, just for fun.</p>\n<h3 id=\"suterusu-and-the-suter-token\">Suterusu and the Suter Token</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://suterusu.io/\">website</a></p>\n<p>Now the ideal private currency would have the simple and scalable\nzk-SNARK technology implemented in a fair way and hopefully started in\nsome novel manner that is truly trustless. Suterusu is one potential\ncandidate for this kind of system. Behind it is a novel idea of\nzk-conSNARKs which can be read about in their\n<a href=\"https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_whitepaper.pdf\">whitepaper</a>,\ntheir\n<a href=\"https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_yellowpaper%20V%200.2.pdf\">yellowpaper</a>\nand a document on <a href=\"https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_architecture.pdf\">Suterusu\narchitecture</a></p>\n<p>This technology hasn't been extensively vetted, but it has the\npotential to solve all the issues in privacy coins.</p>\n<p>Suterusu isn't quite meant to be an analog of Monero. The token itself\nis actually just an Ethereum token. In fact, this might be the\ninteresting part: Part of its system is that it can provide zk-conSNARK\nshielding <em>to other currencies</em> that support smart contracts. You can\nuse Suter to transact with Ethereum privately, for example.</p>\n<p>The Suterusu system, however is not perfect as far as I'm concerned. It\nisn't a self-propelling decentralized system in the way that Bitcoin or\nMonero is. That makes is regulatable and subject to human whim in a way\na cryptocurrency should not be. It is a designed system with dev taxes\nand even <a href=\"https://medium.com/suterusu/regulation-compliance-of-suterusu-625abc752eb9\">regulatory compliance that includes\nblacklisting</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks\">zk-SNARKs vs. zk-STARKs</h2>\n<p>In addition to the zk-S<strong>N</strong>ARK system used in Zcash and Pirate, there\nalso exists zk-S<strong>T</strong>ARKs, which like zk-conSNARKs allow for a trustless\nsetup. <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf\">Whitepaper</a>.</p>\n<p>To repeat, zk-SNARK stands for &quot;Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive\nARguments of Knowledge.&quot; zk-S<strong>T</strong>ARK stands for &quot;Zero Knowledge\n<strong>Scalable Transparent</strong> ARguments of Knowledge.&quot; [Scalable]{.dfn}\nbecause it scales better than zk-SNARKs and [transparent]{.dfn} because\nit has a trustless setup.</p>\n<p>I do not know of a currency project that uses this technology now. Like\nzk-conSNARKs, it's only a couple years old.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ideal-privacy-coin\">The ideal privacy coin</h2>\n<p>Would be one that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is actually private.</li>\n<li>Is trustless.</li>\n<li>Is highly scalable.</li>\n<li>Is truly decentralized and unmanaged by a singular entity.</li>\n<li>Has reasonably fair emission/mining schedule.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Monero gets only half credit on 3, but full points on the rest. Wownero\nis the same, although perhaps it should be taken less seriously as a\nDoge-tier joke. Zcash fails on 1 and 2. Pirate Chain fails on 2 and 5.\nSuterusu has great tech, but flounders on 4.</p>\n<p>So the recipe for an ideal currency is here. It is one that implements\nthe zk-conSNARK technology of Suterusu or zk-STARKs (provided that such\ntechnology is appropriately vetted), but does so in a way without\ncentralization, dev taxes and other self-refuting silliness.</p>\n<p><strong>This ideal currency might just be Monero itself</strong>, to my understanding\nMonero has contemplated integrating zk-STARKs as they become more\nwell-travelled. Such an addition, if it works, would drastically improve\nthe scalability of Monero even if it might require somewhat of an\noverhaul.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"donate\">Donate</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/xmr.svg\" /> Monero &ndash; <code>48jewbtxe4jU3MnzJFjTs3gVFWh2nRrAMWdUuUd7Ubo375LL4SjLTnMRKBrXburvEh38QSNLrJy3EateykVCypnm6gcT9bh</code></li>\n<li><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/wow.svg\" /> Wownero &ndash; <code>Wo3kx9FY1sQLndodemcibifzbdi2Q7X9YaoaMAVdKCwXieVJBJTRdpG3WoWzQ1atnBLK1Wti7P72p34K21EaACRv124yiLenE</code></li>\n</ul>", "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/monero-and-other-privacy-coins/", "date_published": "2021-05-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
