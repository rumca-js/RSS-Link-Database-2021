They say they are escaping one of the most repressive and secretive dictatorships in the world.\n\nFilming and reporting in Eritrea is almost impossible, but for more than five years, producer and director Evan Williams has been working to gather footage secretly shot inside the country and to interview people like Michael who\u2019ve escaped. The resulting film, from FRONTLINE in the United States and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, documents searing allegations of torture, arbitrary detention and indefinite forced conscription into military service.\n\nWatch \"Escaping Eritrea\" in full starting May 4: https://to.pbs.org/2Ri5SJi\n\nLove FRONTLINE?
