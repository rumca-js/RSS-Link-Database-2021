It started with a patch featuring Qu-Bit Scanned wavetable oscillator into Mutable Instrument Blades filter (one of my favorite combos), Intellijel Plonk into [redacted], and Dixie 2+ into the Polaris filter (another favorite pairing). Qu-Bit Surface is alternating between a hihat and tonal lines. The drums were from the VPME QD but I didn't like the way they sounded so I replaced them with some drum loops in Ableton. Vocals were recorded through the Voicelive 3 in a few takes. Wanted to go for a Chemical Brothers/DFA vibe. Full module list after lyrics. \n\nLyrics: \n\nI\u2019ve got a feeling that it\u2019s gonna be a good one \nI\u2019ve got a feeling that is welling up in me\nI\u2019ve got blood and all the tubes I need to use it\nIs this love or is it just anxiety\n\nWell the sun is shining\nAnd my heart is pumping\nAnd my head is telling me ok ok\nYou should cross your fingers\nYou should hold it back now\nCos from here it\u2019s only one step away\n\nI'm out of control\n   \nI\u2019ve got restlessness that I cannot contain\nIt's a sickness that gets into everything I do\nI\u2019ve got thoughts that will not keep to themselves\nSo tell me, what the hell am I supposed to do\n\nWell the sun is beating\nOn this pregnant feeling\nAnd I\u2019m worried that my head just might explode\n\nI\u2019ve tried to explain it\nNothing can constrain it\nMaybe I would be much better off alone\n\nI\u2019m a cannonball\nI\u2019m a sinking ship\nI\u2019m a neutron that refuses to decay\n\nI am telling you\nNo, I am begging you\nPlease, just get out of my way\n\nI'm out of control\n\nModules used (affiliate links through Perfect Circuit):\nMutable Instrument Blades: https://bit.ly/3xw9nMT\nQu-Bit Scanned: https://bit.ly/3xuf0uZ\nQu-Bit Surface: http://bit.ly/pc_surface\nNoise Engineering Imitor Versio: http://bit.ly/pc_imitor\nAfter Later Monsoon: http://bit.ly/pc_after_later\nVPME QD: http://bit.ly/pc_VPME_QD\nVarigate 8+: http://bit.ly/pc_varigate\nIntellijel Quadrax: http://bit.ly/pc_quadrax\nIntellijel Quad VCA: http://bit.ly/pc_quadvca\nInellijel Dixie 2+: http://bit.ly/pc_dixie\nPamela's New Workout: https://bit.ly/2QRxnZO\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching.
