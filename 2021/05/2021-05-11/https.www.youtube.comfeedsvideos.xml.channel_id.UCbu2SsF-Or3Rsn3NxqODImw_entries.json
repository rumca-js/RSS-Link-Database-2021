Each protagonist have different paths through the same story, and you can see both of them in action in the above gameplay.\n\nYou'll not be fighting along, as you'll be fighting alongside a merry band of anime boys and girls who are part of a special forces unit who can support you in combat encounters. But of course, there seems to be a deeper mystery to unravel in the main story.\n\nWe got out hands on with the game for about 3 hours, but the gameplay in the above video was provided by Bandai Namco. Scarlet Nexus is set to launch on June 25th for PC, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4.\n\nYou can check out our full preview right here - https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scarlet-nexus-anime-style-action-has-potential-but-hasnt-fully-impressed-yet/1100-6491378/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb22V8tXwFw", "date_published": "2021-05-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Hilarious Battlefield Bugs & Glitches Compilation", "description": "With Battlefield 6 on the horizon we take a moment to reflect on some of the hilarious bugs and glitches that went on a rampage throughout the Battlefield games.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gptfbke3lGk", "date_published": "2021-05-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Rarest Mass Effect Moments You Might Not Know About", "description": "Jean-Luc lists some of the rarest moments in the Mass Effect Trilogy that you might not have experienced in your playthrough.\n\nIntro:\nThere\u2019s this side quest in the original Mass Effect where you must collect 16 ancient asari writings, which you do by scanning planets as well as landing on uncharted worlds and searching for them. It's an awful collection task quest, deathly boring to do even with a guide. The reward isn\u2019t even all that great, being nothing but some measly experience points.  The saving grace being that because the whole thing is so meaningless, you can skip it without fear of missing out.\n\nHowever, in Mass Effect 3, there is a small side quest on the Citadel for Shepard stan Conrad Verner. Turns out that before Conrad devoted his life to worshiping the Commander, he wrote a doctoral dissertation on xenotechnology and dark energy integration and can help Shepard obtain some ancient tech, tech that happens to be written in ancient asari dialect. If you collected 10 of the 16 asari writings all the way back in Mass Effect 1, you get some special dialogue as well as a plus five bonus to your war assets.\n\nThis is one of those rare moments most players didn\u2019t fully experience in their Mass Effect trilogy playthrough: Strange or unique outcomes that required you to do something either really obscure to get or because you made choices in the past that fall in-between the cracks of the series\u2019 mortality system. Most players tend to play a pure pure paragon or renegade playthrough, but if you mix and match you get some pretty interesting consequences. In this video, I\u2019m going to go through a few of my favourite rare Mass Effect outcomes.\n\nOriginally this video was really long, so if you have other moments you\u2019d love to see, or have your own favourites, drop them in the comments below or like this video and subscribe so we know you want to see more.
