This was a simple modular performance that kept wanting lyrics. It started with a patch featuring Qu-Bit Scanned wavetable oscillator into Mutable Instrument Blades filter (one of my favorite combos), Intellijel Plonk into [redacted], and Dixie 2+ into the Polaris filter (another favorite pairing). Qu-Bit Surface is alternating between a hihat and tonal lines. The drums were from the VPME QD but I didn't like the way they sounded so I replaced them with some drum loops in Ableton. Vocals were recorded through the Voicelive 3 in a few takes. Wanted to go for a Chemical Brothers/DFA vibe. Full module list after lyrics. 

Lyrics: 

I’ve got a feeling that it’s gonna be a good one 
I’ve got a feeling that is welling up in me
I’ve got blood and all the tubes I need to use it
Is this love or is it just anxiety

Well the sun is shining
And my heart is pumping
And my head is telling me ok ok
You should cross your fingers
You should hold it back now
Cos from here it’s only one step away

I'm out of control
   
I’ve got restlessness that I cannot contain
It's a sickness that gets into everything I do
I’ve got thoughts that will not keep to themselves
So tell me, what the hell am I supposed to do

Well the sun is beating
On this pregnant feeling
And I’m worried that my head just might explode

I’ve tried to explain it
Nothing can constrain it
Maybe I would be much better off alone

I’m a cannonball
I’m a sinking ship
I’m a neutron that refuses to decay

I am telling you
No, I am begging you
Please, just get out of my way

I'm out of control
