Janet Woodcock, (FDA)

allows for a younger population to be protected

bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy

and to ending the pandemic

March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2021

1.5 million COVID-19 cases in individuals 11 to 17 years

Potential benefits of this vaccine in individuals 12 years of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks


 

Scientific Brief: SARS-CoV-2 Transmission (7th May)

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/sars-cov-2-transmission.html

https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by exposure to infectious respiratory fluids

People release respiratory fluids

Infection depends on concentration of viral particles

Three principal ways: 

Inhalation

Mucous membranes depositions

Touching mucous membranes

Factors in inoculum

Airstream 

Thermal layering and 

Initial jetting of exhalations

Enclosed spaces

Increased exhalation

Prolonged exposure

Progressive loss of viral viability and infectiousness

Temperature

Humidity

Ultraviolet radiation 

Infection still possible

More than 6 feet away

Passing through a space an infectious person has left

Prevention of transmission

Physical distancing 

Well-fitting masks

Adequate ventilation

Avoidance of crowded indoor spaces

The Evidence-Based Medicine Consultancy

Frontline Covid Critical Care Alliance

British Ivermectin Recommendation Development (BiRD) panel

Re-purposed existing drugs

Ivermectin, a safe medicine which has been used for nearly 40 years to treat parasitic infections

3.7 billion people have been treated with Ivermectin for parasitic infections and it has been found to be extremely safe

New evidence shows that it has potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties as well

urge the Indian Government and all states in India to adopt Ivermectin as a matter of urgency as a front line prophylaxis and treatment for Covid-19

All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Indian Council of Medical Research have urgently responded with a recommendation to use Ivermectin in mild outpatient illness

We also recommend that Ivermectin be used as covid-19 prophylaxis

on a large scale through mass distribution of Ivermectin in the dose of 0.2mg/kg (12mg for a 60 kg person) 

weekly to adults to decrease transmission amongst the general population in the current crisis

We believe this will save thousands of lives and reduces the suffering of millions.
