FRONTLINE tells the inside story of how the major reversal of the Clean Power Plan and other environmental policy rollbacks happened; how President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, went from fighting the federal agency to running it; and 
how the anti-regulatory and anti-climate change science movements in America reached a moment of triumph.
