The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Deep Sea Diver's Jessica Dobson didn't neglect the details for the group's Tiny Desk (home) concert. For starters, she sported an impressive homemade bolo tie that she crafted from an NPR enamel pin and "a little bit of duct tape." She also chose a very particular location for the shoot: "There were countless times this past year that I wanted to be transported out of my house and into a different world," the singer and guitarist explains to NPR via email. "One of my favorite and most inspiring worlds is that of David Lynch's Twin Peaks. I wanted to pay homage to the show by recreating the red room for our Tiny Desk."

Inside the red room, the set includes three tracks from Deep Sea Diver's marvelous 2020 album, Impossible Weight, plus "Stop Pretending," which was chosen as one of NPR Music's favorite songs of 2020. Joining the band are some special guests: Natalie Schepman and Meegan Closner of the band Joseph sing background vocals, and Dobson's Beagle, Henry, makes an appearance. (Dobson claims he's the only one who didn't care that Deep Sea Diver couldn't tour last year.) The performance itself is a testament to the group's attention to detail, too; as in many of the best Tiny Desk concerts, the band's magnetic energy and finely-crafted songs make the small space feel huge and joyous.

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Get ready for some fiery desert guitar-shredding, Saharan style, with the music of Mdou Moctar. Producer and American bassist Mikey Coltun told me that "the concert was filmed outside of the house we were all staying at in Niamey, Niger, in November/December 2020." He continued, "As with any sort of musical happenings in the region, once some music is blasted, that's an invitation for anyone to come join, sing, clap, dance, and just come together as a community. We wanted to present the Tiny Desk exactly like this, from when we started playing to finally the energy growing with fans crowded around filming on their cell phones and passing around Tuareg tea."

The (home) concert starts off with Mahamadou Souleymane, a.k.a. Mdou Moctar, playing a melodic line on acoustic guitar, with Ahmoudou Madassane on rhythm guitar, Souleymane Ibrahim playing percussion on a calabash, and Mikey Coulton on his Fender Mustang bass on the song "Ya Habibti" from the album Afrique Victime. It's an album of songs dealing with intense subjects close to Mdou Moctar's heart: colonialism, exploitation, inequality, but also love.

You can hear the real musical fire on the last song, the roughly 7-minute psych-rock title track to Afrique Victime. "Africa is a victim of so many crimes," Mdou Moctar sings in French."If we stay silent, it will be the end of us." Silence is not something in Mdou Moctar's vocabulary.

SET LIST
"Ya Habibti"
"Tala Tannam"
"Afrique Victime"

MUSICIANS
Mahamadou "Mdou Moctar" Souleymane: lead guitar, vocals
Ahmoudou Madassane: rhythm guitar, vocals
Mikey Coltun: bass
Souleymane Ibrahim: calabash
