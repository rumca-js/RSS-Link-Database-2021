Christopher Nolan's films are renowned for their use of practical effects and their dependency on internal rules and structures. However, these elements of Nolan's films exist at odds with their meditations on more existential themes. Like many of Nolan's movies, TENET is an exploration of the challenges in trying to understand something that past the limits of human comprehension. TENET is a movie about the importance of faith in the face of a chaotic and uncertain universe.

## Biomutant Is an Ambitious Mess

Biomutant is a fascinating and frustrating game. On paper, it’s an open-world RPG that’s a bit of Zelda, Fable, Fern Gully, and Redwall all mashed together. It had me marveling as it introduced new idea after new idea, only to find them not quite melding together. It’s a game that’s oftentimes clunky to play, but hard to stop talking about. And while it has a litany of problems, it’s ultimately a game that I continue to think about long after rolling credits thanks to its wildly-impressive scope and ambition.
