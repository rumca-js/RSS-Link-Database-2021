B.1.617.2 COVID-19 variant\n\nFirst detected in India in December 2020\n\nMost commonly variant in India from mid-April 2021\n\nNow detected, 43 countries\n\nWe estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic disease\n\nData on all symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England was used\n\nCompared to vaccination status\n\n12,675 sequenced cases\n\n11,621 had B.1.1.7\n\n1,054 had B.1.617.2\n\nResults for both vaccines were similar after one dose\n\nB.1.617.2, 33.5%\n\nB.1.1.7, 51.1%\n\nResults after 2 doses of BNT162b2 Pfizer\n\nB.1.1.7, 93.4%\n\nB.1.617.2, 87.9%\n\nResults after 2 doses of ChAdOx1 Oxford AZ\n\nB.1.1.7, 66.1%\n\nB.1.617.2, 59.8%\n\nInterpretation \n\nThese findings suggest a modest reduction in vaccine effectiveness\n\nA clear increase in levels of effectiveness after two doses\n\nRollout of second doses of ChAdOx1 was later than BNT162b2\n\nOxford AZ effectiveness probably increases beyond two weeks after second dose\n\nNumbers of cases and follow-up periods are currently insufficient to estimate effectiveness against severe disease, including hospitalisation and mortality\n\nPrevious vaccine effectiveness estimates with other variants have shown higher levels of effectiveness against more severe outcomes\n\nTherefore, higher levels of effectiveness against severe disease may be anticipated with the B.1.617.2 vaccine. \n\nMatt Hancock\n\nThis new evidence is groundbreaking \u2013 and proves just how valuable our COVID-19 vaccination programme is in protecting the people we love.\n\nDr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE\n\nThis study provides reassurance that 2 doses of either vaccine offer high levels of protection against symptomatic disease from the B.1.617.2 variant.\n\nWe expect the vaccines to be even more effective at preventing hospitalisation and death, so it is vital to get both doses to gain maximum protection against all existing and emerging variants.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nwith 13,000 lives saved and 39,100 hospitalisations prevented overall\n\nToday\u2019s data is astounding and a true reflection of just how important it is to get both
