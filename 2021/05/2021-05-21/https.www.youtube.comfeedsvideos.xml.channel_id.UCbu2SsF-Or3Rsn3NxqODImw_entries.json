Perfect Dark took Rare's FPS concept in a bold and interesting new direction introducing a brand new science fiction world. With a brand new Perfect Dark revealed to be in the works as of 2020, it's the ... dare I say, perfect time to look back.\n\nReplaying Perfect Dark, I feel like FPS games just aren\u2019t made like this anymore. And that\u2019s both a positive thing and a shame at the same time. I think First Person Shooters have evolved the most of any genre since their advent with BattleZone, Doom, and Quake. Especially on consoles, where controls were always an issue and somehow, Rare made it work with the wonky N64 controller, even if it now feels incredibly dated. So - let\u2019s take a look back at Perfect Dark.\n\nAs the game takes place in 2023, how crazy would it be if the brand new game released in 2023?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9hllgLY8eU", "date_published": "2021-05-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "BOTW's Absurd Glitch That No One Talks About", "description": "We dive into one of the most intense glitches in Zelda: Breath of the Wild called Super Menu Overload, where the fabrics of reality fall apart. Just how difficult is it to do though?\n\nIn the video above, we explain how and where the glitch works, and its ridiculous process of setting it up. For this video alone, 10,800 weapons were duplicated just to understand and share how this glitch works. The ability to freeze arrows in place, lose entire body parts, and kill a gold Lynel with a flood of thrown weapons sounds enticing, but is it worth the mental stress of achieving the glitch?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE9qypTqMOg", "date_published": "2021-05-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
