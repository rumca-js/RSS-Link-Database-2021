In this Bee Weekly, Kyle and Ethan talk to Mark Armitage of the Dinosaur Soft Tissue Research Institute about non-fossilized tissue being found in dinosaur bones and what that might mean for the war between science and religion.

Thereâ€™s the usual weird news of the week, glorious hate mail, and more!
