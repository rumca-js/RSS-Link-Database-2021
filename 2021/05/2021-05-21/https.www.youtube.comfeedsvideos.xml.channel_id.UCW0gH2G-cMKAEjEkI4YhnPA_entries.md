Today, we answer what would happen if Galadriel had taken the One Ring when offered to her by Frodo.  We have some clues from JRR Tolkien himself: "Galadriel would have proceeded in the policy now adopted by Sauron: they would have built up an empire with great and absolutely subservient generals and armies and engines of war, until they could challenge Sauron and destroy him by force."

Using my usual level of research, I put forth my best guess for what would transpire - including how it would affect the timeline, how Galadriel would go about amassing forces to challenge Sauron, and how she would keep the One Ring secret from a newly resurrected Gandalf the White.
