In 2017, Jessica Lea Mayfield released the powerful album, "Sorry Is Gone." The album emerged from Mayfield's experience of domestic violence and her departure from that toxic situation. Mayfield wants people to be OK talking about the subject. "The things that need to change can't change unless we talk about them," she says.

Watch Jessica Lea Mayfield perform two songs from "Sorry Is Gone" from a November 2017 session in The Current studio.

## Little Man - Found is a Passion (2011)

Though Chris Perricelli originally hails from Massachusetts, it wasn't until he moved to Chicago that he formed his current band Little Man. After the band moved to the Twin Cities next and built a reputation by constantly touring and gigging around town, City Pages named them the Best Rock Band of 2007.

Little Man decided to keep it simple this time around, producing Orbital Amusement, with the help of local production studio Z. Vex Effects. With his moustache, long hair, and classic rock and roll inspired by the Kinks, David Bowie, and T. Rex, Perricelli looks and sounds like he stepped straight out of the 1970s.

Watch this performance by Little Man, recorded in The Current studio in 2011.
