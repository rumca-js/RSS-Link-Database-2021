Just how difficult is it to do though?\n\nIn the video above, we explain how and where the glitch works, and its ridiculous process of setting it up. For this video alone, 10,800 weapons were duplicated just to understand and share how this glitch works. The ability to freeze arrows in place, lose entire body parts, and kill a gold Lynel with a flood of thrown weapons sounds enticing, but is it worth the mental stress of achieving the glitch?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE9qypTqMOg", "date_published": "2021-05-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "10 Minutes Of The Last Of Us Part II PS5 Enhanced Gameplay (4K/60FPS)", "description": "Check out 10 minutes of The Last of Us Part 2 running on PS5 with the new 60fps patch released by Naughty Dog.\n\nThe Last of Us Part II was originally released for PS4 in June 2020, and now Naughty Dog has released the free 1.08 update patch that will boost the game to 60fps for those playing via backwards compatibility on PS5.

But, we have plenty of ideas for what we'd love to see if Titanfall 3 were to ever happen, and as it turns out, so did you! In our last Titanfall 2 video, we asked you what you would want to see were a Titanfall 3 to ever happen, and here are some of our favorite suggestions!\n\nApex Legends\u2019 universe is the same as that of Titanfall, and their new tie in Hero, Valkyrie, only brings many of us a stronger desire and dare-I-say need for a Titanfall 3. Last time we discussed Titanfall 2, I asked what you would want in a Titanfall 3. So, here are our favorites - and somebody please send this to Respawn and get them on it. Thanks.\n\nTitanfall 2 has an extraordinary good single player campaign. The writing and characters were surprisingly strong, and if you didn\u2019t feel a connection to BT by the end, I think you might actually be a monster.\n\nSo - it\u2019s no surprise that the top request by \u201cDennis Nick\u201d was a return of \u201cMatthew Mercer\u201d - who voiced the main protagonist, Jack Cooper.\n\n#TF2 #Titanfall2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfbbzAM-HCM", "date_published": "2021-05-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
