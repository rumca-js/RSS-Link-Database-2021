After the band moved to the Twin Cities next and built a reputation by constantly touring and gigging around town, City Pages named them the Best Rock Band of 2007.\n\nLittle Man decided to keep it simple this time around, producing Orbital Amusement, with the help of local production studio Z. Vex Effects. With his moustache, long hair, and classic rock and roll inspired by the Kinks, David Bowie, and T. Rex, Perricelli looks and sounds like he stepped straight out of the 1970s.\n\nWatch this performance by Little Man, recorded in The Current studio in 2011.\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; David Campbell\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thecurrent #littlemanband", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKS3u5jgrFc", "date_published": "2021-05-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
