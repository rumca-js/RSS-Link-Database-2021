Once all the technology and relevant regulation is ready, Tesla\u2019s main revenue will come from renting self-driving taxis. Once Tesla\u2019s vision is fully realized, owning a car will be reserved to a small minority class of people. And there is no other company closer to reaching that vision than Tesla.\n\nPlenty of mainstream car companies have entered the autonomous and electric vehicle sphere. But none of them has the Tesla advantage. In 2016, about the time when other companies where just starting out with autopilot, Tesla already collected more than 1.3 billion miles of data from all kinds of real world scenarios, diverse roads and global weather conditions with regular people at the wheel. Their next competitor, Google\u2019s Waymo, only covered 2 million miles since 2009, all with employees on board.\n\nThe rate at which Tesla gathers more data is also unparalleled. By 2020, Tesla\u2019s mileage with autopilot activated passed 3 billion. Waymo, on the other hand, only collected 20 million miles in autopilot. That\u2019s Tesla leading by more than a factor of 100. Tesla is competing with other car companies but Tesla is not just a car company. It\u2019s also an energy company, a charging company, a software company and most importantly a data company. \n\nFootage of Tesla's \"vision\" feed:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/Carscoopscom/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/greentheonly/ \n\n\nSources\nThe Tesla Advantage https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-20/the-tesla-advantage-1-3-billion-miles-of-data\nTesla's Data Engine https://www.braincreators.com/brainpower/insights/teslas-data-engine-and-what-we-should-all-learn-from-it\nTesla Data Collection:\nhttps://www.tesla.com/about/legal\nhttps://www.axios.com/what-tesla-knows-about-you-1f21d287-a204-4a6e-8b4a-0786b0afac45.html\nhttps://www.zimlon.com/b/comprehensive-list-of-data-tesla-collects-from-their-customers-cm529/\nhttps://electrek.co/2020/10/24/tesla-collecting-insane-amount-data-full-self-driving-test-fleet/\nhttps://electrek.co/2017/05/06/tesla-data-sharing-policy-collecting-video-self-driving/\nhttps://electrek.co/2017/06/14/tesla-autopilot-data-floodgates/\nhttps://electrek.co/2020/04/22/tesla-autopilot-data-3-billion-miles/\nhttps://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/teslas-in-car-cameras-raise-privacy-concerns/\nhttps://fortune.com/2015/10/16/how-tesla-autopilot-learns/\nMobility as a Service https://www.cio.com/article/3433931/tesla-the-data-company.html\nhttps://digital.hbs.edu/platform-digit/submission/tesla-a-data-driven-future/\nhttps://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/who-owns-the-data-your-car-collects/\n\nFederated learning https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html\nHomomorphic encryption https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/cryptonets-applying-neural-networks-to-encrypted-data-with-high-throughput-and-accuracy/\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/tesla-deters-owners-from-picking-unofficial-providers-to-boost-car-performance/\nhttps://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/elon-musk-tesla-autopilot-price-subscription/\n\nOn vertical market integration https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/when-and-when-not-to-vertically-integrate\n\nOpen Source battle:\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/tesla-starts-to-release-its-cars-open-source-linux-software-code/\nhttps://www.theregister.com/2018/05/21/tesla_inches_toward_gpl_compliance/\nhttps://gizmodo.com/it-only-took-six-years-but-tesla-is-no-longer-screwing-1826191876\nhttps://sfconservancy.org/blog/2019/oct/30/calling-all-tesla-owners/\n\nTesla in China https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-13/china-loves-elon-musk-and-tesla-tsla-how-long-will-that-last\n\nCredits\nMusic by: CO.AG Music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\nhttps://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcu2YUCa0lA", "date_published": "2021-05-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
