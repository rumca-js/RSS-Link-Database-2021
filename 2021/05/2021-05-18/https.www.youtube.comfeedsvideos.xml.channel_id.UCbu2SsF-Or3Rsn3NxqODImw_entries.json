It's an exciting, complicated premise, but one that has a lot of promise. Lucy breaks down what you need to know.  \n\nDeathloop's premise sounds pretty simple, right? Two assassins caught in a time loop. Except when you factor in eight different targets, four different districts to visit at four different times of day, some sort of magic abilities, a player-controlled assassin hunting you, oh, and a time loop, it starts to get a little more complicated.\n\nLucy recently got to see Deathloop in action and while the premise is pretty layered, the execution (no pun intended) looks to be an exciting, natural evolution of previous Arkane games. In the video above she breaks down what you need to know about the game, its main characters Colt and Julianna, and just how the time loops on the mysterious island of Blackreef will work.\n\nDeathloop will be a timed PlayStation 5 exclusive and is launching on September 14.
