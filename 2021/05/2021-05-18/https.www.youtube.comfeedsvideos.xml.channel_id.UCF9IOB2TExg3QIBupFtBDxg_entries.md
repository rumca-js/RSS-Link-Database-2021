12 weeks significantly increases antibody responses in older people

175 vaccine recipients older than 80

Received second dose of Pfizer

Either 3 weeks or 11–12 weeks after first dose

Outcomes, levels of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

T cells

Peak antibody levels were 3.5 times higher

12 weeks versus 3 weeks

Peak T-cell response was lower in 12 week group

But antibodies maintained for 9 weeks after second vaccine

(Other countries may have different vaccines and variants and social conditions)

Stephen Griffin, virologist, University of Leeds

People are theoretically vulnerable between their first and second jab

What’s worked in the UK is maintaining restrictions at the same time as vaccinating
