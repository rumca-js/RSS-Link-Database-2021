The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

From a house in East Nashville, Kathleen Edwards sings about how thankful she is for those early aughts when she was praised with awards, television appearances, touring to packed venues — even if the tour bus with the bed in back was "total crap." As she continues to sing "Glenfern," the opening track to her first album in eight years as well as this Tiny Desk (home) concert, she remembers her former husband and collaborator.

But, as thankful as she is for those years, they overwhelmed her, and she quit. Struggling with depression, Kathleen Edwards opened a coffee shop called Quitters Coffee and lived a very different life.

A handful of years later, in 2017, she was invited to Nashville by Maren Morris to write some songs. That Nashville visit sparked a new beginning and eventually the 2020 album Total Freedom, which birthed the four songs you hear in this Tiny Desk concert.

She's flanked by her carefully masked musical mates: guitarist Todd Lombardo, who also plays on Kathleen's latest album, and Justin Schipper on dobro. Kathleen Edwards seems happy playing these new songs. They can be songs of sadness, sometimes filled with seething, such as "Ashes to Ashes," but she's also grateful for her everlasting love for a four-legged creature and the little catalpa tree where it's buried. She's found strength after those nonstop years — a lesson for us all, perhaps about life and time and its gift.

SET LIST
"Glenfern"
"Ashes to Ashes"

While many of us have gotten better at using technology to feel close to our friends and collaborators over the past year, there's still no replacement for being in the same room as someone who you swear can read your mind. That's what it feels like to watch punk band Palberta, whose music makes magic out of repeated phrases sung in tight harmony and charmingly zany pop hooks. For its Tiny Desk (home) concert, shot on a MiniDV and a Hi8, the band crams into one member's Philly basement for a set that's a testament to the group's tight-knit collaboration and playful exuberance.

The guitar-bass-drums trio is made up of Ani Ivry-Block, Nina Ryser and Lily Konigsberg, and each member sings and plays each instrument. Here, they trade places every couple of songs for a handful of tracks from the band's recently-released album Palberta5000 – including the frenzied opener "Eggs n' Bac,'" the queasy-yet-sentimental "The Cow" and the anxious and melodic "Big Bad Want" – plus a sweet testament to grooving called "Sound Of The Beat" from 2018's Roach Goin' Down. The songs aren't over-complicated but still manage to surprise at every turn – a true Palberta specialty. "We've been a band for eight years," Konigsberg explains after the first song with a giggle, "and we're gonna be rockin' out forever, together." I certainly hope so.

SET LIST
"Eggs n' Bac'"
"No Way"
"The Cow"
"Big Bad Want"
"Sound of the Beat"
"Before I Got Here"

MUSICIANS
Ani Ivry-Block: guitar, bass, drums
