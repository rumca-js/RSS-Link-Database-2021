Three years ago today — on May 18, 2018 — Lake Street Dive visited The Current to perform songs off "Free Yourself Up," their album from that year. Since then, Lake Street Dive have released another full-length, "Obviously," which dropped March 21, 2021, and was our Album of the Week for the week of May 3. More recently, Lake Street Dive announced the amicable departure from the band of founding member Mike "McDuck" Olson.

But for this highlight, we're looking back at that 2018 session when Lake Street Dive performed songs from that year's effort, including the hit single, "Good Kisser."
