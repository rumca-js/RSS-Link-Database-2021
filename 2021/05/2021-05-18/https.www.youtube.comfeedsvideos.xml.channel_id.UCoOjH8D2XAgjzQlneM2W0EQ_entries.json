But instead of buying and selling Amazon stock - it was through marrying Jeff Bezos (without a prenup) - and divorcing Jeff Bezos. \n\nThen there\u2019s poor ol\u2019 Elon - who didn\u2019t go through just one pricey divorce - but three! The first was with Justine Musk. Elon had to pay at least $4 million dollars in legal and accounting fees, which comes out to $170,000 per month. \n\nThen came his second marriage with actress Talulah Riley. They divorced in 2012, leaving Riley with $4.2 million dollars. Then they made up, got married again and then divorced again a year later, leaving Riley with a much more respectable $16 million. \n\nWhich brings us to Bill and Melinda Gates. Bill married Melinda on a Hawaiian Island around the same time as Bezos in 1994. Twenty-seven years later in 2021, they file for divorce and are still working out how much of the $130 billion dollar empire Melinda is gonna get. Bill has already given her $2.4 billion dollars worth of shares. \n\nBefore you go calling all women gold diggers, unless you\u2019re divorcing the ultra wealthy, usually neither the groom nor the bride comes out on top. Usually, in America, the real gold diggers that profit off of a divorce - are the divorce lawyers, the judges, the family courts.\n\nWell, what most people don\u2019t realize is that in America, marriage is not just a vow of love, but a financial contract.\n\nYou hire a divorce lawyer to protect yourself against your spouse taking your stuff. You pay maybe $600/hr, $700/hr, and maybe even more insane numbers. Why do people pay such high rates? Bc they\u2019re desperate!\n\nAs a lawyer, you\u2019re paid hourly, therefore, it\u2019s in your best interest to keep the fighting going bc if your client\u2019s divorce is settled, you lose your income stream.\n\nThe lawyers aren\u2019t alone in this industry though, the other major players are the judges. And with great power - comes great opportunities to be bribed.\n\nSo if you do get married, maybe don\u2019t follow in the steps of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk and get a prenup.\n-----------------------\n\nNo Spirit - Careless https://chll.to/b9af7f36 \n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
