I am very anxious about everyone\u2019s thoughts. All in all this is a million subscriber video, a \u201cStardew Is A Nightmare\u201d game review, and a satirical view on Google and YouTube as a whole.\n\nOKAY so I don\u2019t talk a lot about Stardew Valley exactly. I actually had pretty lofty goals from the start, I wanted to compare the Joja corporation in Stardew Valley to Google, drawing analogues from that to my life, while also reviewing the game. But I had to say COME ON MATT keep it simple for the first of these videos.\n\nOverall though new style is easier to make too, I started with a Stardew Valley review to keep it simple but I have filmed my next video too (a Fallout 1 review) which will be out by the end of the month. I\u2019ve also written two other videos, including a Fallout 2 review next. This new style will hopefully let me reach my goal of monthly review videos I have been trying to achieve for a while.\n\nSpecial thank you to my members!\nSiberial\nSuperhero3807\nBio Geek\n\nFilming Equipment:\nCamera: Canon EOS 90D Digital SLR Camera Body\nLens: Sigma 18-35mm f1.8 DC Art HSM Lens - Canon Fit\nMicrophone: Deity W.Lav Omnidirectional Lavalier Microphone", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT3ivkkjizk", "date_published": "2021-05-28 20:23:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
