Far Cry 6 has murder alligators, weapons made of junk, and special super moves powered by gear items--it’s about as crazy as you’d expect for a Far Cry game. Here’s everything we know so far about the upcoming Far Cry 6. 

Far Cry 6 is set to release October 7th, 2021 and Ubisoft revealed some new details about the game’s extensive weapon and vehicle systems. In this video, you’ll learn about the new weapon categories including the Regular, Resolver, and Supremos. According to the devs, there are 49 guns in the game that range from leftover revolutionary weapons like the SKS and M16 to over-the-top homebrew varieties like a minigun built from motorcycle parts, and a CD launcher that that plays Macarena. Far Cry 6 also sees the return of pets, two of which are an aggressive alligator named Guapo and a cute Weiner dog named Chorizo, who is lethal in its own way.

The island of Yara itself has been isolated for fifty years and has a number of biomes like swamps, towns, jungles, and cities with skyscrapers and underground areas. To travel around players can expect a variety of options including guerilla trails, horses, Mad-Max-style technicals, and even a tank. Flying over the island will be limited until Anti Aircraft batteries are destroyed. Players can also expect many of Far Cry’s usual activities including taking over bases and engaging in side-activities with different characters. 

As we approach E3 2021 and a new Ubisoft Forward event in June, we expect to learn a lot more about the plot of Far Cry 6, the motivation for its main villain Anton Castillo, who is played by actor Giancarlo Esposito. We also hope to learn a lot more about how his son Diego may or may not succumb to the dictator and his brutal tactics. Make sure to keep checking back in at GameSpot.com for our Play For All event as the gaming industry's biggest trade show of the year, E3 2021, happens this June.
