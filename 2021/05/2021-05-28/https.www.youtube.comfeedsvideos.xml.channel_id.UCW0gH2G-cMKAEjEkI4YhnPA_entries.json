Today, we will not only cover their likely creation by the greatest craftsman in Tolkien's mythology, but also how they ended up in Middle-earth and where they were placed!  We know that Saruman, Denethor, Sauron, and Aragorn all use various palant\u00edri during the events of the War of the Ring, but there were originally seven in Middle-earth (plus one in Valinor).  Check out the video to see where each was stationed, how they were lost, and how Sauron came to possess on himself!\n\n*Hit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings!*  \n\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
