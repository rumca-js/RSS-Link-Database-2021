During the pandemic more people have been playing games than ever before, but while it's easy to think gamers are gravitating towards the likes of Animal Crossing or Minecraft, many people instead turn to intense, difficult games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne for comfort.

Alexander Kriss, psychotherapist and author of 'The Gaming Mind', explains the science of how games help people's mental health, and why playing stressful games during a global pandemic might be a good thing.
