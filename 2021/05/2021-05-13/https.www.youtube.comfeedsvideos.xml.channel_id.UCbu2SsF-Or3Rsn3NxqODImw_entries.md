Four years after Zelda's release, players continue to find new things in the game. This time, we focus more on glitches and game development.

In the video above, we cover 21 tips and tricks that aren’t quite as well known, ranging from secrets to glitches, some that are pretty simple and others that are fairly complex. Breath of the Wild has been out for four years at this point, and players have found some amazing things, intended or not, that keep the game and its sense of discovery feeling fresh. 

We point out some secrets about the weird properties of Link’s house lawn, as well as finally getting access years later to treasure chests which were previously thought to be impossible to get. With Breath of the Wild’s highly anticipated sequel still nowhere to be found, these tricks should help you continue to push what you're able to do in the original game.

Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is finally here, giving both newcomers to the series and longtime fans a way to experience developer BioWare's acclaimed action-RPG trilogy with remastered visuals and quality of life improvements. 

The video above is an excerpt of episode 93 of the GameSpot After Dark podcast, in which Jean-Luc Seipke, Tamoor Hussain, Lucy James, and Jordan Ramée all get together to discuss their early impressions of Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. Don't worry, the crew doesn't go into story spoilers--the conversation sticks to analyzing developer BioWare's adjustments to the trilogy, specifically Mass Effect 1.

Most of the big changes in Legendary Edition's Mass Effect 1 are to the game's combat. Though it still doesn't quite match its two sequels in terms of shooting mechanics and squad management, the remaster still  introduces quite a few welcome adjustments for the 14 year old game, which makes it much more approachable by modern day standards. If the combat was putting you off from trying the game before, it'd be wise to give it an earnest playthrough with the Legendary Edition.

Beyond combat, the Legendary Edition also improves Mass Effect 1's load times and enhances the visuals with higher resolutions, improved assets, and better frame rates. Most of the adjustments to environments, lighting, and visual style seem to be made with the intent of better aligning Mass Effect 1's visuals with that of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, for better and for worse. When it comes to characters, the remaster has done wonders with adding additional detail to its alien characters, though not all humans look as good. They're very...shiny.

Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is available for Xbox One, PS4, and PC. The remaster can be played on Xbox Series X|S and PS5 via backwards compatibility as well.

## Mass Effect - Legendary vs Original Graphics Comparison | Characters, Eden Prime, Citadel

Enjoy this comparison of the Mass Effect remaster to the 2007 original game.

Mass Effect Legendary Edition brings a whole lot of improvements to the original Mass Effect, especially in the graphics department. Nearly 14 years have passed since the game's release on the Xbox 360, and that means a whole lot of technical advancement has been applied to the game. With that in mind, we're taking a look at Mass Effect Legendary Edition and the original Mass Effect's PC release to see just how much the new remaster has improved on the original.

The video above lets you check out both versions of Mass Effect, sticking to the early portions of the game. We've got some direct comparisons of Mass Effect characters to show how lighting and textures have been improved. The comparison also extends to Eden Prime, the game's first combat mission, and the Citadel, where you'll spend some time talking with humans and aliens and advancing the story.

While Mass Effect has seen a lot of technological improvements in the Legendary Edition, it's important to note that the story remains the same. You'll be playing through a smoother, better-looking version of the 2007 sci-fi RPG classic, but for all intents and purposes, this is the same game. As Jordan Ramée noted in his review in progress, the Legendary Edition brings an enhanced version of the original game that's a lot easier to play and looks a lot better, but it's not without its visual and gameplay quirks.
