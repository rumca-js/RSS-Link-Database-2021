I love what he does, how he does it and most of all, the positive attitude he does it with. So here's my remix of young Marc before his Loop Daddy days. \nMarc's channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/marcrebillet\np.s. If you don't know where the footage is from, it's a short news story of him waiting in line to get an iphone and coming out of it a winner. A classic.
