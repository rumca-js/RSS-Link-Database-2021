As a teenager, Chris founded the brutally honest magazine Film Threat, which began as a fanzine while he was a college student in Detroit. As Film Threat evolved into a respected national magazine, he relocated to Los Angeles. The print magazine was retired in 1997 when it was re-launched as a web site. FilmThreat.com found a huge audience online and was named one of the top five movie web sites by the Wall Street Journal. Chris has appeared as a film expert on MSNBC, E!, CNN, Travel Channel, and Reelz Channel. Chis has also hosted shows on FX, Starz, IFC and G4TV\u2019s Attack of the Show as the show\u2019s film expert. His weekly movie review segment DVDuesday was among the most popular on G4. Chris is also an author, having written The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made and The Complete DVD Book. His book The Ultimate Film Festival Survival Guide is considered the bible of the industry and is required reading at film school. \n\nSUBSCRIBE TO FILM THREAT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL \nhttps://www.youtube.com/FilmThreat\n\nWATCH TEASER TRAILER FOR 'FILM THREAT SUCKS' \nhttps://youtu.be/fhj-C_Z-h6w\n\nMORE VIDEOS WITH CHRIS GORE \nhttps://bit.ly/3lcbuSm \n\nCONNECT WITH CHRIS GORE\nhttps://filmthreat.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/filmthreat\nhttps://www.facebook.com/filmthreat\nhttps://twitter.com/filmthreat\nhttps://www.youtube.com/FilmThreat\n\n(Affiliates)\n\nSAVE $15 ON YOUTUBE TV - LIMITED TIME OFFER\nhttps://tv.youtube.com/referral/r0847ysqgrrqgp\n\n\u25baWE USE THIS CAMERA (B&H) \u2013 https://buff.ly/3rWqrra\n\u25baWE USE THIS EDITING PROGRAM (ADOBE) \u2013 https://goo.gl/56LnpM\n\u25baWE USE THIS SOUND RECORDER (AMAZON) \u2013 http://amzn.to/2tbFlM9\n\u25baWRITERS, TRY FINAL DRAFT FREE FOR 30-DAYS!

This lens was a big investment for us and one we wish we could have made sooner.  Started using this lens at the end of 2013 - http://amzn.to/2tbtmOq\n\nAUDIO \n\nRode VideoMic Pro  - The Rode mic helps us capture our backup audio.  It also helps us sync up our audio in post http://amzn.to/2t1n2hx\n\nLIGHTS - Although we like to use as much natural light as we can, we often enhance the lighting with this small portable light.  We have two of them and they have saved us a number of times - http://amzn.to/2u5UnHv\n\n*These are affiliate links, by using them you can help support this channel.\n\n\n#movies #film #filmmaking", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12f0ligwS5s", "date_published": "2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["movies"]}]
