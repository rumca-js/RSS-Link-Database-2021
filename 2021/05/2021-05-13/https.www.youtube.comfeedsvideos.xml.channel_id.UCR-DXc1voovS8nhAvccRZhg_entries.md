It took some convincing, but KIOXIA sent me two of their latest Enterprise SSDs, the PM6 SAS 24G drive, and the CM6 PCIe NVMe drive, and I test them using the MegaRAID card and 'Elrond' storage enclosure sent to me by Broadcom.

How do the drives perform? Well, watch the video and find out!

A friend sent me his MSI Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080. I'm going to plug it into my Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 and see what happens. I'll also probably recompile the Linux kernel, live!
