Regional restrictions possible

Surge testing in 15 areas across England

Cluster areas, increased genome sequencing

Bringing forward second vaccine for people who are eligible

It is a variant of concern, we are anxious about it

Deaths, 580,837

One dose, 46.6%

Fully vaccinated, 35.8%

CDC, 13th May

If you’ve been fully vaccinated:

resume activities that you did prior to the pandemic

resume activities without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart, 

except where required locally

Domestic travel, do not need tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after

do NOT need to get tested before leaving the United States unless your destination requires it.

still need a negative test or evidence of recovery before boarding an international flight to the United States

should still get tested 3-5 days after international travel

do NOT need to self-quarantine after arriving in the United States.

If you’ve been around someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms

Except, correctional, detention facility or a homeless shelter

For now, if you’ve been fully vaccinated:

follow guidance at your workplace and local businesses

Masks on planes, buses, trains, domestic and international

International arrivals, test within 3 days

Test and stay at home is symptomatic

Weaken immune system, talk to their healthcare provider

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779853

Single-center, retrospective cohort study, Tel Aviv

Data were collected on symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections confirmed via polymerase chain reaction

December 20, 2020, to February 25, 2021

N = 6,710 health care workers

Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection

Incidence rate fully vaccinated = 4.7 per 100,000 days

Incidence rate unvaccinated = 149.8 per 100,000 days

97% protection

Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection

Incidence rate fully vaccinated = 11.3 per 100,000 days

Incidence rate unvaccinated  = 67 per 100,000 days

86% protection

UK SAGE, Emergency meeting over rapid spread of Indian variant
17th May
21st June

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/12/rapid-spread-indian-covid-variant-prompts-emergency-sage-meeting/

UK, 45 days first discovered

Cases, = 727

About 3 times quicker than SA variant
 
Bolton, epicentre, cases doubled in past week

Blackburn, Bedford, South Northamptonshire, Sefton, Tynemouth, Glasgow

MP for Bolton, Yasmin Quareshi

Residents had been slow to get vaccinated

React study, Imperial College London

Infections are spreading more rapidly amongst the Asian community, and in some of the other groups in the population

Andy Burnham

Requested  Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, all over-16s in Bolton, and Greater Manchestee

to mitigate the risks of spread in those communities where we are seeing more transmission

Cases inked to international travel

Prof James Naismith, Rosalind Franklin Institute

We should view it as a country-wide problem

Localised restrictions unlikely to work

but maybe Sage already have that data 

before we continue to unlock

Goa and ivermectin prophylaxis

For all those above the age of 18

Irrespective of Covid-19 symptoms

12 mg of ivermectin for five days

State Health Minister Vishwajit Rane

Goa would be the first state in the country to administer, to its adult citizens

as a step towards protecting lives

State government, drug will be given to the people through its chain of health centres

There have been studies in journals of therapeutics, 

there have been studies in the US, UK, Japan, Germany

that when this is administered in advance

when the entire population is administered this treatment

their mortality rate fell and effects of Covid-19 on that individual were also less
 
All our doctors and experts, the chief minister have unanimously decided to go ahead with this

We should go ahead and give it to the population

It’s a must

Dr Vinayak Buvaji, Goa chapter, Indian Medical Association

Treatment should not be given for a short period of five days

but should ideally be continued till the pandemic is brought under control

The ideal regimen of ivermectin is to administer it on the first, third and seventh day

and then continue it once a week till the pandemic is brought under control

Giving the tablets only for five days will not be impactful

The people weighing below 60 kg should be given the 12 mg dose of ivermectin

while those above 60 kg should be given the 18 mg dose

Dr Buvaji writing to state Health Department to change the proposed ivermectin dose protocol

Chief Scientist, World Health Organization, Dr Soumya Swaminathan

Safety and efficacy are important when using any drug for a new indication

WHO recommends against the use of ivermectin for #COVID19 except within clinical trials

Merck Statement on Ivermectin use During the COVID-19 Pandemic

https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/

No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies 

No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease

A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies
