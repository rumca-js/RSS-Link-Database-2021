This time, we focus more on glitches and game development.\n\nIn the video above, we cover 21 tips and tricks that aren\u2019t quite as well known, ranging from secrets to glitches, some that are pretty simple and others that are fairly complex. Breath of the Wild has been out for four years at this point, and players have found some amazing things, intended or not, that keep the game and its sense of discovery feeling fresh. \n\nWe point out some secrets about the weird properties of Link\u2019s house lawn, as well as finally getting access years later to treasure chests which were previously thought to be impossible to get. With Breath of the Wild\u2019s highly anticipated sequel still nowhere to be found, these tricks should help you continue to push what you're able to do in the original game.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:22 Bullet Time From Trees\n0:36 Use Critters For Shock Damage\n1:01 Tree Top Secret\n1:16 Light Arrow Ricochet\n1:35 Arrow Ricochet\n1:53 Stal Skull Kick Attack\n2:15 Lost Woods Forgotten Tree\n2:28 Shield Surf Grinding\n2:44 Link's House Lawn Is Weird\n2:58 Actual Mousetrap\n3:21 Torchized Flameblade\n3:45 Iced Food Slides\n3:58 Nintendo's Foley Work Objects\n4:22 Nintendo's Audio Demonstration\n4:35 Keese Wing Designs\n4:45 Master Cycle Pivoting\n5:07 Rare Enemy Animations\n5:22 Use Blizzard Rods To Farm\n5:33 Double Guardian Parts\n5:45 Misplaced Treasure Chests\n6:24 Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NMfV0y3DqU", "date_published": "2021-05-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Dying Light 2 Ask Me Anything (Episode 2)", "description": "Tune in as the developers at Techland answer more of your burning questions about Dying Light 2 in the second Ask Me Anything.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmTXNucPs0", "date_published": "2021-05-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mass Effect Legendary Edition Review In Progress Discussion", "description": "Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is finally here, giving both newcomers to the series and longtime fans a way to experience developer BioWare's acclaimed action-RPG trilogy with remastered visuals and quality of life improvements. \n\nThe video above is an excerpt of episode 93 of the GameSpot After Dark podcast, in which Jean-Luc Seipke, Tamoor Hussain, Lucy James, and Jordan Ram\u00e9e all get together to discuss their early impressions of Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. Don't worry, the crew doesn't go into story spoilers--the conversation sticks to analyzing developer BioWare's adjustments to the trilogy, specifically Mass Effect 1.\n\nMost of the big changes in Legendary Edition's Mass Effect 1 are to the game's combat. Though it still doesn't quite match its two sequels in terms of shooting mechanics and squad management, the remaster still  introduces quite a few welcome adjustments for the 14 year old game, which makes it much more approachable by modern day standards. If the combat was putting you off from trying the game before, it'd be wise to give it an earnest playthrough with the Legendary Edition.\n\nBeyond combat, the Legendary Edition also improves Mass Effect 1's load times and enhances the visuals with higher resolutions, improved assets, and better frame rates. Most of the adjustments to environments, lighting, and visual style seem to be made with the intent of better aligning Mass Effect 1's visuals with that of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, for better and for worse. When it comes to characters, the remaster has done wonders with adding additional detail to its alien characters, though not all humans look as good. They're very...shiny.\n\nMass Effect: Legendary Edition is available for Xbox One, PS4, and PC. The remaster can be played on Xbox Series X|S and PS5 via backwards compatibility as well. \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n01:32 - Combat & Gameplay\n13:26 - Remastered Visuals\n22:37 - Story and Characters\n27:35 - What Doesn't Hold Up?\n30:26 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2gx54FDbI0", "date_published": "2021-05-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "28 Minutes of Days Gone PC Gameplay (4K)", "description": "Get a glimpse of the first 28 minutes of gameplay from Days Gone on the PC in 4K.

Nearly 14 years have passed since the game's release on the Xbox 360, and that means a whole lot of technical advancement has been applied to the game. With that in mind, we're taking a look at Mass Effect Legendary Edition and the original Mass Effect's PC release to see just how much the new remaster has improved on the original.\n\nThe video above lets you check out both versions of Mass Effect, sticking to the early portions of the game. We've got some direct comparisons of Mass Effect characters to show how lighting and textures have been improved. The comparison also extends to Eden Prime, the game's first combat mission, and the Citadel, where you'll spend some time talking with humans and aliens and advancing the story.\n\nWhile Mass Effect has seen a lot of technological improvements in the Legendary Edition, it's important to note that the story remains the same. You'll be playing through a smoother, better-looking version of the 2007 sci-fi RPG classic, but for all intents and purposes, this is the same game. As Jordan Ram\u00e9e noted in his review in progress, the Legendary Edition brings an enhanced version of the original game that's a lot easier to play and looks a lot better, but it's not without its visual and gameplay quirks.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:47 - Tile Screen & Opening\n02:17 - Characters\n07:26 - Eden Prime\n10:53 - The Citadel", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04f9T0_xSX4", "date_published": "2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mass Effect Legendary Edition Livestream", "description": "Join Lucy James and Tamoor Hussain as they play through the opening of the remaster of Mass Effect from the Legendary Edition.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Anm5uKxI0I8", "date_published": "2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Total War: Warhammer 3 Hands On Battle Preview", "description": "Total War: Warhammer 3 is introducing new factions in Kislev, Cathay, Khorne, Nurgle, Slaanesh and Tzeench, but also bringing a new battle type to the franchise.
