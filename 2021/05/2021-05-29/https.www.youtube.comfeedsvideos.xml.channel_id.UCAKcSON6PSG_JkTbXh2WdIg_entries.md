ABOUT THE PERFORMERS

Elena Moon Park is a musician and educator living in Brooklyn, N.Y. She is a co-Artistic Director of the Brooklyn-based organization Found Sound Nation, which uses collaborative music creation to connect people across cultural divides, and is an active freelance multi-instrumentalist in New York City, specializing in family music and contemporary classical music. In 2012, Elena released "Rabbit Days and Dumplings," her debut album for families featuring folk and children's music from East Asia. She performs and tours with all-ages musicians Sonia De Los Santos and Dan Zanes, and leads her own all-ages folk rock band, Elena Moon Park and Friends. She released a second album, "Unhurried Journey," in summer 2020.

House of Dance Twin Cities — Established in 2014, House of Dance Twin Cities is Minnesota's first and premier dance studio dedicated to teaching breakdancing, popping & locking and hip hop dance classes to people of all ages and experience levels. The instructors humbly maintain that they are students themselves, dedicated to improving their dance so that they can share more with others. They take their art and their jobs very seriously and appreciate everyone who entrusts their learning with them.

Koo Koo Kanga Roo — Koo Koo Kanga Roo is a dance party of the senses. For the last 12 years, lifelong friends and collaborators Bryan and Neil have toured the globe delighting fans with their high-energy music, infectious positivity, and interactive live show. Of course, the global pandemic of 2020 threatened to put an end to the carefree fun that had come to define the band, but instead of putting the group on pause or looking for office jobs, Bryan and Neil doubled down and created their most triumphant and expansive album yet.
