The Evidence-Based Medicine Consultancy

Frontline Covid Critical Care Alliance

British Ivermectin Recommendation Development (BiRD) panel

Re-purposed existing drugs

Ivermectin, a safe medicine which has been used for nearly 40 years to treat parasitic infections

3.7 billion people have been treated with Ivermectin for parasitic infections and it has been found to be extremely safe

New evidence shows that it has potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties as well

urge the Indian Government and all states in India to adopt Ivermectin as a matter of urgency as a front line prophylaxis and treatment for Covid-19

All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Indian Council of Medical Research have urgently responded with a recommendation to use Ivermectin in mild outpatient illness

We also recommend that Ivermectin be used as covid-19 prophylaxis

on a large scale through mass distribution of Ivermectin in the dose of 0.2mg/kg (12mg for a 60 kg person) 

weekly to adults to decrease transmission amongst the general population in the current crisis

We believe this will save thousands of lives and reduces the suffering of millions.
