But, we have plenty of ideas for what we'd love to see if Titanfall 3 were to ever happen, and as it turns out, so did you! In our last Titanfall 2 video, we asked you what you would want to see were a Titanfall 3 to ever happen, and here are some of our favorite suggestions!\n\nApex Legends\u2019 universe is the same as that of Titanfall, and their new tie in Hero, Valkyrie, only brings many of us a stronger desire and dare-I-say need for a Titanfall 3. Last time we discussed Titanfall 2, I asked what you would want in a Titanfall 3. So, here are our favorites - and somebody please send this to Respawn and get them on it. Thanks.\n\nTitanfall 2 has an extraordinary good single player campaign. The writing and characters were surprisingly strong, and if you didn\u2019t feel a connection to BT by the end, I think you might actually be a monster.\n\nSo - it\u2019s no surprise that the top request by \u201cDennis Nick\u201d was a return of \u201cMatthew Mercer\u201d - who voiced the main protagonist, Jack Cooper.\n\n#TF2 #Titanfall2", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfbbzAM-HCM", "date_published": "2021-05-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Deathloop Preview (4K)", "description": "Deathloop is some parts a natural evolution of past Arkane games, and something else altogether. It's an exciting, complicated premise, but one that has a lot of promise. Lucy breaks down what you need to know.  \n\nDeathloop's premise sounds pretty simple, right? Two assassins caught in a time loop. Except when you factor in eight different targets, four different districts to visit at four different times of day, some sort of magic abilities, a player-controlled assassin hunting you, oh, and a time loop, it starts to get a little more complicated.\n\nLucy recently got to see Deathloop in action and while the premise is pretty layered, the execution (no pun intended) looks to be an exciting, natural evolution of previous Arkane games. In the video above she breaks down what you need to know about the game, its main characters Colt and Julianna, and just how the time loops on the mysterious island of Blackreef will work.\n\nDeathloop will be a timed PlayStation 5 exclusive and is launching on September 14.
