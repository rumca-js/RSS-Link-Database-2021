Check out 10 minutes of The Last of Us Part 2 running on PS5 with the new 60fps patch released by Naughty Dog.

The Last of Us Part II was originally released for PS4 in June 2020, and now Naughty Dog has released the free 1.08 update patch that will boost the game to 60fps for those playing via backwards compatibility on PS5. While this gameplay footage was captured on the PS5 console at 4k 60fps, The Last of Us Part II only runs at a native 2560x1440 resolution like it's PS4 Pro counterpart according to Digital Foundry. The new update also gives you the option to switch back to 30fps if you’d prefer.

## The People Want Titanfall 3

Titanfall 3 is... not announced. But, we have plenty of ideas for what we'd love to see if Titanfall 3 were to ever happen, and as it turns out, so did you! In our last Titanfall 2 video, we asked you what you would want to see were a Titanfall 3 to ever happen, and here are some of our favorite suggestions!

Apex Legends’ universe is the same as that of Titanfall, and their new tie in Hero, Valkyrie, only brings many of us a stronger desire and dare-I-say need for a Titanfall 3. Last time we discussed Titanfall 2, I asked what you would want in a Titanfall 3. So, here are our favorites - and somebody please send this to Respawn and get them on it. Thanks.

Titanfall 2 has an extraordinary good single player campaign. The writing and characters were surprisingly strong, and if you didn’t feel a connection to BT by the end, I think you might actually be a monster.

So - it’s no surprise that the top request by “Dennis Nick” was a return of “Matthew Mercer” - who voiced the main protagonist, Jack Cooper.

## Deathloop Preview (4K)

Deathloop is some parts a natural evolution of past Arkane games, and something else altogether. It's an exciting, complicated premise, but one that has a lot of promise. Lucy breaks down what you need to know.  

Deathloop's premise sounds pretty simple, right? Two assassins caught in a time loop. Except when you factor in eight different targets, four different districts to visit at four different times of day, some sort of magic abilities, a player-controlled assassin hunting you, oh, and a time loop, it starts to get a little more complicated.

Lucy recently got to see Deathloop in action and while the premise is pretty layered, the execution (no pun intended) looks to be an exciting, natural evolution of previous Arkane games. In the video above she breaks down what you need to know about the game, its main characters Colt and Julianna, and just how the time loops on the mysterious island of Blackreef will work.

Deathloop will be a timed PlayStation 5 exclusive and is launching on September 14. For more, check out Tamoor Hussain's written preview on gamespot.com.

Call of Duty’s mid-season 3 update is dropping new game modes, 80s action stars, and limited-timed changes to Warzone. The John Rambo Pack includes the operator with two finishing moves, special blueprints for the Combat Knife, an LMG, and assault rifle. Die Hard’s John McClane also joins season 3 with his own operator bundle. It’ll include blueprints for the Fara 83, MP5, and one for an undisclosed tactical rifle that could be the AUG.

Limited time events and locations are coming to Warzone including Die Hard’s Nakatomi Plaza with missions such as disarming C4 on the building’s roof, finding special supply boxes and “interrupting an arms deal gone wrong.” The location will also include the Nakatomi Plaza vault that can be opened by players using special keycards. Also coming to Warzone is a smaller battle-royale mode called Power Grab with 100 players and no Gulag. Players can be revived with a Kill-Confirmed like system. 

Cold War is getting new content including two new maps, Duga and Black Ops 2’s Standoff remake, the new killstreak Combat Bow, a new weapon the Ballistic Knife. Keeping in them, new game modes Die Hardpoint and Rambo’s Gun Game will be added to the mix. New secondary weapons that will also crossover to Warzone are the Baseball Bat and AMP63: Pistol. Finally there is a new Main Quest for Zombies. Make sure to head on over to GameSpot as the Season 3 progresses to find out more.
