Dave Portnoy decides that Elon Musk can't have all the fun with market manipulation, surely he should get a turn! Will it work? Does the SEC care? Has the market gone completely crazy?

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
