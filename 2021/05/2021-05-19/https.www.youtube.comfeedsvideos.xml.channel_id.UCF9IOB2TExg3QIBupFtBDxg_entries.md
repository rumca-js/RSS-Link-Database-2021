Third dose trial, Cov-Boost study

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57174733

Need for third dose autumn or winter?

Factors

Variants and vaccine efficacy

Longevity of protection

Trial starts in June

N = 3,000 

All ages who had their first dose in December or January

Prof Saul Faust, chief investigator, University of Southampton

It could be that some age groups may not need a booster and others do

The aim is to find out whether there should be a booster campaign

and which vaccine to use

 Vaccines to be trailed

AstraZeneca (adenovirus vector)

Pfizer (mRNA)

Moderna (mRNA)

Novavax (moth produced spike protein)

Janssen (adenovirus vector)

Valneva (inactivated virus)

CureVac (mRNA)

Half doses will also be tested

Placebo group

Hoped to protect against all current variants

18 sites across the UK

Participants will keep diaries of any side-effects

Immune assessments at one, three and twelve months

UK, variant hotspots to get

FDA, Pfizer storage 

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-brief-fda-authorizes-longer-time-refrigerator-storage-thawed-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine

FDA authorizing undiluted, thawed vials to be stored in the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (35°F to 46°F) for up to 1 month

Up from 5 days

(8% not returned for second dose)

ONS antibody survey, May 18th 

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights#antibodies

19th April

69.3% in England

63.2% in Wales

63.5% in Northern Ireland

59.2% in Scotland

Highest in the older age groups across the UK

Similar across English regions, 

64.8% in the South West to 

69.7% in the North West.

Infection or vaccination?

Vaccinations now

Positive tests

Down 2.6% in past 7 days

Next stage of roadmap

India

Deaths, + 4,329

Highest so far

A 'massive' discrepancy in the death toll

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-57154564

Unlikely to resume vaccines exports until at least October

COVAX implications

Gujarat, patients cleared to 5 km from cost

Mumbai moved 600 Covid-19 patients from field hospitals

Nepal

Taiwan

Cases, + 206 + 335 + 240 = 2,257

All schools closed until June

12 weeks significantly increases antibody responses in older people

175 vaccine recipients older than 80

Received second dose of Pfizer

Either 3 weeks or 11–12 weeks after first dose

Outcomes, levels of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

T cells

Peak antibody levels were 3.5 times higher

12 weeks versus 3 weeks

Peak T-cell response was lower in 12 week group

But antibodies maintained for 9 weeks after second vaccine

(Other countries may have different vaccines and variants and social conditions)

Stephen Griffin, virologist, University of Leeds

People are theoretically vulnerable between their first and second jab

What’s worked in the UK is maintaining restrictions at the same time as vaccinating
