Matt Hancock 

I think it’s quite likely this will become the dominant variant. 

importance of people coming forward for testing

and being careful because this isn’t over yet

we have increasing confidence that the vaccine works against the variant

(Early Oxford University lab data)

the strategy is on track - it’s just the virus has just gained a bit of pace

and we’ve therefore all got to be that bit much more careful and cautious

Over 35s next week

Hospital in Bolton

vast majority of patients, eligible but unvaccinated

Five people who have had a single jab, hospitalised, Indian variant, Bolton, England

One (frail) patient who had received both

No deaths

Local lockdowns not ruled out

Next decision day, 14th June (for 21st June)

Covid symptom study

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEMjCbCYSmI

Is covid changing?

Asymptomatic rate higher after vaccine

Symptoms may be very mild

Fewer symptoms

Shorter symptomatic time

Think, less likely to develop long covid

Less transmission of the virus

More so after 2 doses

Symptoms after vaccination

No vaccine, 5 symptoms in first week

First dose, 2 to 4 symptoms

Booster doses, 0 to 1 symptom

Start of Moderna data

6,900 people have reported on Moderna vaccine

Profile more similar to Pfizer

Short limited side effects

Age differences in side effects

Data adjustments

80% of app users have been vaccinated

Has been adjusted

Cases up slightly in past week

Mostly mild due to younger age or post vaccination

UK risk over next 24 hours

1 in 16,000

1 in 32,000

1 in 46,000

Europe about one month behind UK in lowering trends

Taiwan
