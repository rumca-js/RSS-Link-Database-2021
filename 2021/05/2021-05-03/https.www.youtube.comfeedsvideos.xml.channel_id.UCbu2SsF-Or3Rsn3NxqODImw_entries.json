Another advantage of the PS5 version is ray tracing, which is absent from the PS4 version.\u00a0\n\nDespite ray tracing and load times, however, Resident Evil Village is an impressive visual feat that manages to look and run very well on previous gen hardware. So fear not, PS4 owners, Lady Dimitrescu will still stalk and prey on you in all of her tall and menacing glory all the same from the looks of this comparison.\u00a0\n\nIt won\u2019t be long until we step into the shoes of Resident Evil 7\u2019s protagonist, Ethan Winters, once again in the search for his daughter Rose. The demo, which featured a segment of the village and Lady Dimitrescu\u2019s castle, still leaves many questions to be answered, like Chris Redfield\u2019s involvement and why he murdered Ethan\u2019s wife Mia. It also remains unclear whether or not Lady Dimitrescu is the main villain, and who exactly Mother Miranda is.\n\nResident Evil Village is taking clear inspiration from one of the franchises most beloved installments Resident Evil 4, which also prominently featured a village and gothic-like horror. There are several other notable similarities like the return of a tetris-like inventory system, a merchant, and weapon upgrade systems.\n\nResident Evil Village is a direct sequel to Resident Evil 7.

We look at the iconic weapon type\u2019s struggle with nerfs, buffs, and finding a purpose.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMultiplayer shooters like Call Of Duty and Battlefield have a large number of weapon classes including assault rifles, submachine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, and even rocket launchers. In-game weapons often channel the spirit of their real-world counterparts, such as SMGs being high rate-of-fire weapons that are great at close range but weak at a distance. One gun in particular has a lot of challenges translating to video games. The light machine gun is a weapon primarily designed to keep opponents\u2019 heads down and instill fear. With the ability to respawn and try again, players in multiplayer shooters are generally not afraid to stick their head out, leading developers to explore creative solutions for what role the LMG should serve.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to look at what a light machine gun is, why they often don\u2019t translate to games, types of suppression developers have tried, what happens when LMGs stray into other classes and get nerfed, how they fare in battle royale modes, and some creative implementations of the weapon. We\u2019ll show off some of your favorites such as the M60 from Battlefield Bad Company and the RPD from Modern Warfare 2. We\u2019re also going to explore why Lord Tachanka was the absolute worst character in Rainbow Six Siege until he was reworked recently.\n\nMake sure to head on over to GameSpot\u2019s YouTube page for ongoing coverage of Call Of Duty: Warzone seasons and announcements around the release of the next Battlefield game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUO3xBsO36c", "date_published": "2021-05-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
