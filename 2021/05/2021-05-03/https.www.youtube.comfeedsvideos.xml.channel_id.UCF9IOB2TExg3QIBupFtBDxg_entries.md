We have nowhere to go

We would advise anyone concerned about this to talk to their healthcare professional

Longitudinal analysis shows durable and broad immune memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection with persisting antibody responses and memory B and T cells

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.19.21255739v1

Seattle and Atlanta

n = 254 COVID-19 patients

55% female, 45% male

Ages, 18-82 

Longitudinally from early infection and for eight months
found a predominant broad-based immune memory response

Spike binding and neutralizing antibodies exhibited a bi-phasic decay

With an extended half-life of more than 200 days

Suggesting the generation of longer-lived plasma cells

Sustained IgG+ memory B cell response

Bodes well for a rapid antibody response upon virus re-exposure

Virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were generated and maintained
Estimated half-life of 200 days

CD4+ T (helpers) cell response equally targeted several SARS-CoV-2 proteins

CD8+ T (cytotoxic) cell response preferentially targeted the nucleoprotein

Importance of including the nucleoprotein as a potential vaccine antigen

Follow up for next 3 years
