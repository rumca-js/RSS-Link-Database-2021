The virtual celebration, hosted by Jorge \"Gitoo\" Wright, highlighted outstanding talent in Afro-Latin and Afro-Caribbean music across the globe. Our showcase featured four artists who honored their homes and celebrated the art their heritage has inspired.\n\nLaTesha Harris | May 3, 2021\nFrom her hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Calma Carmona delivers a bewitching Tiny Desk performance. Her voice rarely rises above a whisper as she sings over impassioned Afrobeats during her three-song set \u2014 but when it does, it's a gritty, intimidating growl. Carmona got her start in 2013 when the Latin soul singer-songwriter released her first EP and opened for Beyonc\u00e9's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in Puerto Rico.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"When I Was Your Girl\"\n\"Ella Se Mueve\"\n\"Vibra\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCalma Carmona: vocals\nPedro \"PJ\" Gonz\u00e1lez: guitar\nAdri\u00e1n \"AJ\" Rodr\u00edguez: bass\nJ.
