9,000\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-57217246\n\nMortality rate, 50%\n\nMost cases 12 to 18 days after CoViD recovery\n\nGujarat and Maharashtra and 15 more states\n\n(All 29 states have been told to declare an epidemic)\n\nMaharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital, Indore\n\nLast week, 8 patients\n\nLast weekend, 185 patients\n\nMore than 80% need surgery immediately\n\nHospital has set up 11 wards, 200 beds to treat black fungus\n\n(400 sufferers in Indore)\n\nDr VP Pandey\n\nThis surge in patients was definitely unexpected\n\nWe used to see one or two cases a year previously\n\nThe black fungus infection has now become more challenging than Covid-19\n\nIf patients are not treated in time and properly, than the mortality rate can go up to 94%\n\nThe cost of treatment is expensive, and the drugs are in short supply\n\nAmphotericin B or \"ampho-B\" anti-fungal intravenous injection\n\nEvery day for up to eight weeks\n\nMajority of the patients had recovered from Covid-19 and were male\n\nMost had been treated with steroids, all had underlying conditions, mainly diabetes\n\nA separate study\n\n100 cases of Covid-19 patients who contracted Mucormycosis\n\n79 were men\n\n83 were diabetic\n\nDr Akshay Nayar, eye surgeon\n\nNo patient of mucormycosis has normal blood sugar\n\nCaused by exposure to mucor mould\n\nCommonly found in soil, plants, manure,

B.1.617.2 COVID-19 variant\n\nFirst detected in India in December 2020\n\nMost commonly variant in India from mid-April 2021\n\nNow detected, 43 countries\n\nWe estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic disease\n\nData on all symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England was used\n\nCompared to vaccination status\n\n12,675 sequenced cases\n\n11,621 had B.1.1.7\n\n1,054 had B.1.617.2\n\nResults for both vaccines were similar after one dose\n\nB.1.617.2, 33.5%\n\nB.1.1.7, 51.1%\n\nResults after 2 doses of BNT162b2 Pfizer\n\nB.1.1.7, 93.4%\n\nB.1.617.2, 87.9%\n\nResults after 2 doses of ChAdOx1 Oxford AZ\n\nB.1.1.7, 66.1%\n\nB.1.617.2, 59.8%\n\nInterpretation \n\nThese findings suggest a modest reduction in vaccine effectiveness\n\nA clear increase in levels of effectiveness after two doses\n\nRollout of second doses of ChAdOx1 was later than BNT162b2\n\nOxford AZ effectiveness probably increases beyond two weeks after second dose\n\nNumbers of cases and follow-up periods are currently insufficient to estimate effectiveness against severe disease, including hospitalisation and mortality\n\nPrevious vaccine effectiveness estimates with other variants have shown higher levels of effectiveness against more severe outcomes\n\nTherefore, higher levels of effectiveness against severe disease may be anticipated with the B.1.617.2 vaccine. \n\nMatt Hancock\n\nThis new evidence is groundbreaking \u2013 and proves just how valuable our COVID-19 vaccination programme is in protecting the people we love.\n\nDr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE\n\nThis study provides reassurance that 2 doses of either vaccine offer high levels of protection against symptomatic disease from the B.1.617.2 variant.\n\nWe expect the vaccines to be even more effective at preventing hospitalisation and death, so it is vital to get both doses to gain maximum protection against all existing and emerging variants.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nwith 13,000 lives saved and 39,100 hospitalisations prevented overall\n\nToday\u2019s data is astounding and a true reflection of just how important it is to get both
