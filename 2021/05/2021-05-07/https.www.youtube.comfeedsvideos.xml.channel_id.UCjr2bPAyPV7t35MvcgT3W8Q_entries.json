It's from estimates of damages cost by cybercrime that range from $1 trillion to $6 trillion annually. \nSources: \nhttps://cisomag.eccouncil.org/cybercrime-will-cost-the-world-us6-trillion-by-the-end-of-the-year-study/\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/cybercrime-cost-the-world-over-dollar1-trillion-in-2020\n\nPasswords have been the default authentication method for decades and not much has changed about that. Except, we went from counting computing power in megahertz to gigahertz. But we are still using them, only with a non-binding recommendation of \u201ctry to make them more complicated.\u201d\n\nHalf of your password security depends on making sure you do everything right. Create and manage complicated and unique password for each of your accounts, that should periodically change every few months, store your passwords somewhere safe, with properly encrypted backups you should rotate every time you make a change in any of the dozens of your accounts. And you need to make sure that all of the devices and software you are using to store your password is up to date and your system isn\u2019t compromised and that you never fall a victim of a phishing attack.\n\nSources\nCybercrime cost $1 trillion in 2020 https://www.techradar.com/news/cybercrime-cost-the-world-over-dollar1-trillion-in-2020\n\nThe password is dead https://securityintelligence.com/passwords-are-dead-we-need-a-better-system-now/\nhttps://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/why-the-password-is-dying/\nhttps://blog.lastpass.com/2019/05/passwords-still-problem-according-2019-verizon-data-breach-investigations-report/\nhttps://www.wired.com/2012/11/ff-mat-honan-password-hacker/\nPhishing https://atlasvpn.com/blog/a-record-2-million-phishing-sites-reported-in-2020-highest-in-a-decade/\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/huge-rise-in-phishing-domains-since-covid-vaccines-began\nhttps://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/04/27/defend-organization-phishing-attack/\n\nCybersecurity of data bases https://www.complianceweek.com/cyber-security/data-breach-disclosures-drop-in-2020-report-says/30234.article\n\nFacebook password fail https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-left-hundreds-millions-user-passwords-unencrypted-n985876\nFacebook data leak https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/06/tech/facebook-data-leaked-what-to-do/index.html\n\nPasswords vs passwordless https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/06/13/1521214/0/en/New-Behavioral-Research-Shows-Over-70-of-Consumers-Choose-Passwordless-MFA-Login-Over-Traditional-Usernames-and-Passwords.html\nhttps://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_security_infographic.pdf\nhttps://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/04/11/phishing-resistant-security/\nFIDO https://fidoalliance.org/how-fido-works/\nhttps://fidoalliance.org/specifications/\nhttps://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-ps-20190130/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-ps-20190130.html\nhttps://fidoalliance.org/specs/u2f-specs-master/fido-u2f-overview.html\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/support-fido2-authentication\nhttps://fidoalliance.org/fido2/\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1298.pdf\n\nNitrokey: https://www.nitrokey.com/\nSoloKeys: https://solokeys.com/\n* I am not sponsored nor affiliated with either of these.\n\nCredits\nMusic by: CO.AG Music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\nhttps://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze2i9V1_aIc", "date_published": "2021-05-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
