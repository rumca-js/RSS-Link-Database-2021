He's someone who keeps on keeping on. You can hear it in The Baptism, a poem he wrote in tribute to two great civil rights activists, John Lewis and C.T. Vivian. In this year of reckoning about race in America, Carl's poem acknowledges and accepts the bottomless depth of our legacy of keeping on.\n\nThis is the nature of baptism. A thank you of water in company with the web of Reason, entangled to it. Nothing can be wasted. Artistic, cultural and personal relationships to urbanity and regenerative architecture fosters intellectual, human, and financial capital in restoring and replenishing resources of a historical past, a sustainable present and a wellspring of future opportunities ... Almost clear now. Keep on! Keep on!\n\nThere are some people you're just aware of. You might have never met them, but the vibrations of their work touch your own in a six-degrees-of-separation matrix of mutual mission and message. That's how it was with Carl and me. But now I wanted to reach out across our web of mutual friends and parallel movements, to talk about how it feels to do the work of this time, and what to call it.\n\nThis is a conversation about imagining change and then being bold enough to give voice to your vision \u2014 in words, in music, in intention. Call it courage. Call it activism if you want. Call it, as Carl's mother always did, \"being proactive.\" We just call it doing your work, living your life \u2014 and keeping on.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzEhsL_ezdg", "date_published": "2021-05-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Moses Boyd: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nNikki Birch | May 7, 2021\nThe Church Studios in North London is an institution, home to some of the most iconic records of the last three decades, including Eurythmics'\u00a0Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\u00a0and Adele's\u00a025. From the hallowed Neve Room, Moses Boyd and his band remind us that the U.K. jazz scene still bangs. They also remind us that COVID-19 regulations are much stricter across the pond: physical distancing is the name of the game in this at home concert.\n\nThe set begins with \"Stranger Than Fiction,\" a bouncy grime tune that features saxophonist Quinn Oulton, whose pedals lend his horn a dark and haunting quality. Boyd humbly introduces the band and slips right into \"2 Far Gone,\" and we get a chance to sink our teeth into his virtuosic drumming. Dynamic, at times explosive, and always tasteful, he lays down a bed of rhythm that gives keyboardist Renato Paris and guitarist Artie Zaitz plenty of room to shine. Then it's dancing time! \"BTB\" is a funky Afrobeat tune with an infectious melody that serves as the perfect closer.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Stranger Than Fiction\"\n \u2022 \"2 Far Gone\"\n \u2022 \"BTB\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Moses Boyd: Drums\n \u2022 Artie Zaitz: Guitar\n \u2022 Renato Paris: Synths\n \u2022 Quinn Oulton: Tenor Saxophone, Electronics\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Adam Grant, James Topham, Josiane M.H Pozi\n \u2022 Audio: Luke Pickering\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Nikki Birch\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Bob Boilen\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#mosesboyd #tinydesk #nprmusic", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m26N10wCwss", "date_published": "2021-05-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
