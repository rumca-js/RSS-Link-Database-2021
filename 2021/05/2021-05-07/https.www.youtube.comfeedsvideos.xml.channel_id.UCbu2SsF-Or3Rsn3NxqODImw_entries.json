Hardcore demands you learn and master the game, weigh the cost benefit of crafting, scavenge everything, and make every bullet count.

Managing your resources, knowing how to fight, and how to make money are all important to your survival. If you\u2019re new to the genre, this is the survival guide for you.\n\nIn this video, veteran survival horror player and Resident Evil aficionado, Kurt Indovina, shares some vital tips and tricks in order to ensure your survival in Resident Evil Village. If you\u2019ve spent some time in the shoes of Leon Kennedy, blasting your way through the Los Plagas-controlled villagers of Resident Evil 4, then you should have no problem adapting to Village\u2019s combat, inventory management, treasure hunting, and merchant. But if you\u2019re new to the franchise, it can be a lot to take in.\u00a0\n\nKurt breaks it down into three categories: combat, exploration, and the Duke.  Kurt gives tips on fighting the game's werewolf-like enemies, Lycans, how to look for treasure, the importance of hunting animals, killing crows for pocket change, and best practices when selling your loot as well as upgrading your weapons. While it\u2019s easy to be distracted by Lady Dimitrescu\u2019s empowering demeanor, don\u2019t be fooled, there\u2019s plenty more the game offers in terms of frights and thrills to pay attention too.\n\nWhile Village takes a lot of cues from its previous installment Resident Evil 7, the many environments of the game can be far more daunting than the Baker house Ethan Winters slithered through all those years back. In Resident Evil Village, Ethan must rescue his daughter Rose from the grasp of Mother Miranda, and it's up to you as the player to be prepared for the dangers that await.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOur review: https://youtu.be/Kmkm-LQbcDo\nResident Evil's Complete Timeline Explained: https://youtu.be/QkPgowr-T9g\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro 0:00\nCombat\nTip 1 - Go for the knees 0:32\nTip 2 - Time your counters 1:31\nTip 3 - It's okay to run 1:54\nExploration 2:50\nTip 1 - Always check your map before leaving a room 3:09\nTip 2 - Backtrack 3:55\nTip 3 - Go hunting 4:44\nThe Duke\nTip 1 - Check that treasure before you sell it 5:24\nTip 2 - Sell your guns 5:57\nOutro 6:29", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bL1ehw394E", "date_published": "2021-05-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
