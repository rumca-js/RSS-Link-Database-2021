Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)

Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group

ACIP meetings are open to the public

VaST session on May 17, 2021

Included several presentations on myocarditis following mRNA vaccines

Reports from

Department of Defense (DoD)

Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)

Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)

Veteranâ€™s Administration (VA)

Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA)

VaST concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis

Cases seem to occur

predominantly in adolescents and young adults,

more often in males than females,

more often following dose 2 than dose 1, and

typically within 4 days after vaccination

Most cases appear to be mild
