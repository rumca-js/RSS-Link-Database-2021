Her album Ilusi\u00f3n was nominated for a Grammy for Best Latin Pop Album. She also co-wrote the theme song for NBC's hit television show Parks and Recreation. Armed with a warm, soulful sound, Moreno creates music that offers an intoxicating invitation into her musical world for English and Spanish speakers alike. She is preparing to release a new album later this year. \n\nHouse of Dance Twin Cities \u2014 Established in 2014, House of Dance Twin Cities is Minnesota's first and premier dance studio dedicated to teaching breakdancing, popping & locking and hip hop dance classes to people of all ages and experience levels. The instructors humbly maintain that they are students themselves, dedicated to improving their dance so that they can share more with others. They take their art and their jobs very seriously and appreciate everyone who entrusts their learning with them.\n\nKoo Koo Kanga Roo \u2014 Koo Koo Kanga Roo is a dance party of the senses. For the last 12 years, lifelong friends and collaborators Bryan and Neil have toured the globe delighting fans with their high-energy music, infectious positivity, and interactive live show. Of course, the global pandemic of 2020 threatened to put an end to the carefree fun that had come to define the band, but instead of putting the group on pause or looking for office jobs, Bryan and Neil doubled down and created their most triumphant and expansive album yet.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thecurrent #rockthecradle", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm0aG-YilBA", "date_published": "2021-05-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Sounds Like Home IX \u2013 virtual music festival from The Current", "description": "On Saturday, May 22, The Current is hosting round nine of Sounds Like Home. Join an incredible lineup of Minnesota musicians as we meet up on the internet for a virtual festival. Great music lives here, and you can still enjoy it live right here on The Current\u2019s YouTube channel!\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nBrianna Ko\u010dka \u2014 You know the kind of grief that confines you to bed? The kind that dulls your whole life for a while? Brianna Ko\u010dka has been through that. Over the last few years, the Zoo Animal guitarist has lost a marriage, a boyfriend, and her faith. Throughout the pandemic, she says she has been \"learning how to put it all back together again.\" Ko\u010dka\u2019s upcoming EP Let It Stay, which comes out on May 14, is a warm, crisp collection of jazz-influenced folk songs.\n\nKing Pari \u2014 Cameron Kinghorn and Joe Paris Christensen weren\u2019t setting out to start another project. Kinghorn, frontman of R&B act Nooky Jones, and Christensen, guitarist for the funk band PHO, stumbled into the project after a text exchange. A feverish burst of creative energy kicked off by a beat sent over by Christensen, and King Pari was brought into existence. Eschewing perfection and embracing the squiggly edges of lo-fi production, the duo bring in sounds of funk, '80s electro, and R&B for a dose of \"stonersoul\" that pairs well with a sunny afternoon sitting by the pool.\n\nStrange Relations \u2014 \"There\u2019s nothing more punk than a heartfelt ballad,\" write the duo behind \nStrange Relations. After meeting in college in Philadelphia, Casey Sowa and Maro Helgeson moved to Minneapolis and started their band. When you listen, don\u2019t expect a whole lot of cushion \u2014 this is a bass and drums operation, no guitar in sight. Do expect to be reminded of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Sparks, and maybe even Bj\u00f6rk.\n\nLow Rats \u2014 Formed in Minneapolis in early 2019, Low Rats are a garage-punk rock-and-roll group with a landlocked surf rock undercurrent. The tunes are steeped in Nuggets, and their roots are planted in 80s punk. Low Rats' latest album, Year of the Rat MMXX, dropped in December of 2020 and shows the band successfully resisting the slowdown of quarantin \u2014 full of energetic and scuzzy shredding \u2014 a much needed reminder of the rowdy in-person shows that will soon return.\n\nTufawon \u2014 pronounced like \"two for one\" in reference to the artist\u2019s Dakota and Boricua roots \u2014 is a hip-hop artist, producer, and activist from South Minneapolis. With plans to release a track every week in 2021, Tufawon's ever-growing catalog pulls from his experiences growing up in Minnesota. His socially conscious lyrics connect deeply with his time as an activist: \"Wherever you find resistance, you're more than likely going to find hip-hop,\" Tufawon explained in a 2017 interview with The Current. \"Hip-hop goes hand in hand with resistance.\"\n\nThank you to Gardner Builders for its support of Sounds Like Home IX.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#thecurrent #soundslikehome", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLbuetlYMRw", "date_published": "2021-05-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
