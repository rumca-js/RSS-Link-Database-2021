We have some clues from JRR Tolkien himself: \"Galadriel would have proceeded in the policy now adopted by Sauron: they would have built up an empire with great and absolutely subservient generals and armies and engines of war, until they could challenge Sauron and destroy him by force.\"\n\nUsing my usual level of research, I put forth my best guess for what would transpire - including how it would affect the timeline, how Galadriel would go about amassing forces to challenge Sauron, and how she would keep the One Ring secret from a newly resurrected Gandalf the White. \n*Hit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings!*  \n\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
