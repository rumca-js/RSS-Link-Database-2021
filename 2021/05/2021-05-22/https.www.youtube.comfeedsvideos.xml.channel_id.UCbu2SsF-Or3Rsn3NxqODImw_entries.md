16 years later and Psychonauts remains a quintessential classic that is still absolutely worth your time, especially now that it's on Game Pass.

2005 was an eclectic and exciting year for games, with influential titles like God of War, Shadow of the Colossus, Splinter Cell, Resident Evil 4, and last, but not least, Psychonauts. Each one of these games hold a legacy today, but not all of them were a success upon their release. 16 years ago Psychonauts was released to critical acclaim, but was a commercial failure. Today, however, the game has reached cult status, and now has a sequel on the way.

Psychonauts was the debut title from Double Fine, a studio led by LucasArts veteran Tim Schafer -- the mastermind behind Grim Fandango and Full Throttle. While Psychonauts was not an initial success, it has steadily grown in sales over the years thanks to re-distribution on current gen consoles, giving the game a second wind in 2011. 

In 2019 Microsoft acquired Double Fine, and now most of its titles are available on Game Pass, with the most recent entry being Psychonauts. In this video, Kurt Indovina revisits Psychonauts 16 years later, and regales as to why it’s even a miracle that we’re getting a sequel in the first place.

## Remembering Perfect Dark - A Sci-Fi Fueled Goldeneye

When Perfect Dark released in 2000, it wasn't the sequel anyone had in mind for Goldeneye. Perfect Dark took Rare's FPS concept in a bold and interesting new direction introducing a brand new science fiction world. With a brand new Perfect Dark revealed to be in the works as of 2020, it's the ... dare I say, perfect time to look back.

Replaying Perfect Dark, I feel like FPS games just aren’t made like this anymore. And that’s both a positive thing and a shame at the same time. I think First Person Shooters have evolved the most of any genre since their advent with BattleZone, Doom, and Quake. Especially on consoles, where controls were always an issue and somehow, Rare made it work with the wonky N64 controller, even if it now feels incredibly dated. So - let’s take a look back at Perfect Dark.

As the game takes place in 2023, how crazy would it be if the brand new game released in 2023?
