are around a week\n\nPlaces where transmission of this variant is occurring have different characteristics to each other\n\nPlausible biological reasons as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible\n\nIn the areas where numbers of infections are increasing rapidly under the measures currently in place, \nan even faster increase can be expected if measures are relaxed (high confidence)\n\nIf this variant were to have a 40-50% transmission advantage nationally compared to B.1.1.7, \nindicate that it is likely that progressing with step 3 alone would lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations (similar to, or larger than, previous peaks)\n\nProgressing with both steps 3 and 4 at the earliest dates could lead to a much larger peak\n\nSAGE and immune escape\n\nMay be some reduction in protection given by vaccines or by naturally acquired immunity from past infection,\n\nthough data on this are still mixed. \n\nAny such reduction is likely to affect protection against infection more than protection against severe disease or death\n\nnot yet any clear evidence of any difference in disease severity following infection with this variant\n\n(rapid sequencing of hospitalised cases and infections post vaccination is important)\n\nJCVI continues to review the evidence on different vaccination strategies.", "link":
