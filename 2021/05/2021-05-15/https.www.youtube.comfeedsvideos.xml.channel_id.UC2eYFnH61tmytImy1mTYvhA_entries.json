Gedit provies me with all the tools and shortcuts I need, e.g. Ctrl+A selects all the text in the file. Ctrl+C copies all the text to the clipboard. Ctrl+V pastes the clipboard's text into the file. Ctrl+S autoamtically saves the file. I don't like the VIm way of doing it, which is \":wq\" Also when I want to open Vim I have to open a terminal first which is an inconveienenence for me in my opinion. But on Ubuntu I just need to press the Windows key and search for a program. Then I open Gedit. It's like magic! I dont need know much more then that. That's what I love about gedit, it's so simple and easy! I can also easily change the color schemes, but on the terminal it's kind of harder to do it. But everyone has different opinions so it's ok if u like Vim!\n\nMy website: https://lukesmith.xyz\nPlease donate: https://donate.lukesmith.xyz\nGet all my videos off YouTube: https://videos.lukesmith.xyz\nor Odysee: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@Luke:7\n\nBTC: bc1qw5w6pxsk3aj324tmqrhhpmpfprxcfxe6qhetuv\nXMR: 48jewbtxe4jU3MnzJFjTs3gVFWh2nRrAMWdUuUd7Ubo375LL4SjLTnMRKBrXburvEh38QSNLrJy3EateykVCypnm6gcT9bh\n\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.\nhttps://brave.com/luk005 Get the Brave browser.\nhttps://odysee.com/$/invite/@Luke:7 View my videos on Odysee and get a bonus for joining.\nhttps://www.coinex.com/register?refer_code=ndf87 Get crypto-rich on Coinex.
