Stallman didn't die so you could be more efficiently monitored and controlled by soydevs and PR departments.

I don't like Vim becuase i use gedit. Gedit provies me with all the tools and shortcuts I need, e.g. Ctrl+A selects all the text in the file. Ctrl+C copies all the text to the clipboard. Ctrl+V pastes the clipboard's text into the file. Ctrl+S autoamtically saves the file. I don't like the VIm way of doing it, which is ":wq" Also when I want to open Vim I have to open a terminal first which is an inconveienenence for me in my opinion. But on Ubuntu I just need to press the Windows key and search for a program. Then I open Gedit. It's like magic! I dont need know much more then that. That's what I love about gedit, it's so simple and easy! I can also easily change the color schemes, but on the terminal it's kind of harder to do it. But everyone has different opinions so it's ok if u like Vim!

You are severely wasting your life and time if you DON'T know vim. If you don't know it, you're locked into doing things the dumb way and don't even realize your full potential.
