These heroic hobbits would grow into not only be the tallest hobbits of all time, but also the most militarily accomplished.  They would hold great leadership roles in their post-war days living in The Shire.  Finally, in their last days, they would make one last trip to Rohan and Gondor.\n\nInterview with Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan: https://youtu.be/mUAQwVJHDwA\n\n\n*Hit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings!*  \n\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
