Matt Hancock 

I think it’s quite likely this will become the dominant variant. 

importance of people coming forward for testing

and being careful because this isn’t over yet

we have increasing confidence that the vaccine works against the variant

(Early Oxford University lab data)

the strategy is on track - it’s just the virus has just gained a bit of pace

and we’ve therefore all got to be that bit much more careful and cautious

Over 35s next week

Hospital in Bolton

vast majority of patients, eligible but unvaccinated

Five people who have had a single jab, hospitalised, Indian variant, Bolton, England

One (frail) patient who had received both

No deaths

Local lockdowns not ruled out

Covid symptom study

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEMjCbCYSmI

Is covid changing?

Asymptomatic rate higher after vaccine

Symptoms may be very mild

Fewer symptoms

Shorter symptomatic time

Think, less likely to develop long covid

Less transmission of the virus

More so after 2 doses

Symptoms after vaccination

No vaccine, 5 symptoms in first week

First dose, 2 to 4 symptoms

Booster doses, 0 to 1 symptom

Start of Moderna data

6,900 people have reported on Moderna vaccine

Profile more similar to Pfizer

Short limited side effects

Age differences in side effects

Data adjustments

80% of app users have been vaccinated

Has been adjusted

Cases up slightly in past week

Mostly mild due to younger age or post vaccination

UK risk over next 24 hours

1 in 16,000

1 in 32,000

1 in 46,000

Europe about one month behind UK in lowering trends

Taiwan

Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, Professor Anthony Harnden

Vaccines are almost certainly less effective at reducing transmission of the Indian variant

The vaccines may be less effective against mild disease

but we don't think they're less effective against severe disease

all the evidence so far suggests there is no evidence of increased severity of illness or that the variant evades the vaccine

SAGE, now confident it is more transmissible than existing variants

Not sure how much

Prof Chris Whitty

That's a really critical question to which we do not yet have the answer

SAGE, realistic possibility it could be 50%

Probably will become the dominant strain in the UK

Outbreak, south Glasgow

Wales, 11

R rate

England 0.8 – 1.1

Wales, 0.7 – 1

Scotland, 0.8 – 1.0

NI, 0.8 – 1.1

There are now multiple fast-growing clusters of this variant in the UK

Largest in the northwest of England

Observed doubling times are around a week

Places where transmission of this variant is occurring have different characteristics to each other

Plausible biological reasons as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible

In the areas where numbers of infections are increasing rapidly under the measures currently in place, 
an even faster increase can be expected if measures are relaxed (high confidence)

If this variant were to have a 40-50% transmission advantage nationally compared to B.1.1.7, 
indicate that it is likely that progressing with step 3 alone would lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations (similar to, or larger than, previous peaks)

Progressing with both steps 3 and 4 at the earliest dates could lead to a much larger peak

SAGE and immune escape

May be some reduction in protection given by vaccines or by naturally acquired immunity from past infection,

though data on this are still mixed. 

Any such reduction is likely to affect protection against infection more than protection against severe disease or death

not yet any clear evidence of any difference in disease severity following infection with this variant

(rapid sequencing of hospitalised cases and infections post vaccination is important)

JCVI continues to review the evidence on different vaccination strategies.
