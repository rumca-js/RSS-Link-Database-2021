This week on our Mass Effect lore series, we dive into the backstory of the Reapers, a mysterious group of ancient machines that travel to the Milky Way galaxy every 50,000 years to kill all sentient life.

Mass Effect is a series that grapples with existentialism--the idea that, with free will, a person can use the ability to think, feel, and act to determine their own fate. Interestingly, however, it does this on a scale so overwhelming that it often challenges the philosophy by diminishing the impact you think you can have. Its narrative drives home the idea that you are a single drop of water in a vast ocean, or--more appropriately--a dwindling star in a universe of hundred thousand million of them. That feeling of insignificance is best reinforced by the series' primary antagonist: the Reapers.

Resident Evil Village has fascinating villains who will attempt to rip Ethan's face off. Dave explores what we know and the lore behind Alvina Dimitrescu, Donna Beneviento and Angie, Salvatore Moreau, Karl Heisenberg, and of course, Mother Miranda. It's time for some Resident Evil Village Lore.

Early on in Resident Evil: Village, Ethan is thrown into the wolf’s den, and you get a glimpse of the Lords who await you. I was immediately intrigued by their design and wanted to know more - especially after waking up with a creepy doll in my face. So, here is the lore of Resident Evil: Village’s main villains.

It’s important to start with Miranda and the Cadou, as her tale will help explain the rest of the four lords.

Alcina Dimitrescu was the 181st subject who Miranda experimented on, and as Miranda herself notes, her Cadou Affinity was “Most favorable.”

With leaks and rumors flying around the anticipated release of Battlefield 6, such as massive destruction, extreme weather events, and massive player count, it's time to go back to Battlefield 3, 4, and Bad Company 2 to see how these mechanics have played out in the past and if they are good or bad ideas in a next-gen title. 

Battlefield 6 is confirmed to release sometime between October and December this year. It's scheduled to be revealed in June, and we'll likely get a more in-depth look during EA Play on July 22. There have been a number of leaks and rumors lately such as the next game having highly destructible cities, extreme weather events, giant rockets, Osprey aircraft, and a near-future setting that includes drones and Boston Dynamics robots. While we can't currently confirm any of this, what we can do is go back to older Battlefield titles set in modern times to see if these ideas could be good or bad for the series.
It's hard to believe that it's been seven years since the last DLC, Final Stand, dropped for a contemporary Battlefield. In this video, we're going back to Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and even Hardline to see what parts of those games could be built on for the next game and what ideas should not be included.

There have been more recent announcements from an investor call including the fact that Battlefield 6 will be on last-gen consoles as well as the current PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The investor call also included revelations such as the next-gen versions of the game potentially having higher player counts, more advanced physics, and more destruction. Battlefield 6 is currently being worked on by four studios including DICE, DICE LA, Criterion, and EA Gothenburg. Stay close to GameSpot for incoming announcements on the next Battlefield game.
