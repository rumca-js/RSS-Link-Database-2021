Here I simply show you how to get a Monero wallet and receive transactions. I recommend all internet Landchads to do exactly this even if you don't plan on buying crypto because it's a good way to have a little "tip jar" for the Monero, which is really the only cryptocurrency that's actually used as such. Use this as an excuse to get your feet wet in a new world.
