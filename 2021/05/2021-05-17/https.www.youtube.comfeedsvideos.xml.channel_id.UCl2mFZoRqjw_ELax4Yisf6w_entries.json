We want to show her that there is grassroots support for Right to Repair bill A7006 throughout New York. Her Albany office number is 518-455-5172 and her District office number is 718-820-0241. Her email address is RozicN@nyassembly.gov\n\nYou can also contact your assemblyperson and senator here: https://states.repair.org/states/newyork/ I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU CONTACT BOTH IF YOU ARE AN NY RESIDENT. \n\nThe last chair wondered why people didn't just use the manufacturer's repair service and said he buys a new one when his old item breaks, so he didn't see why this was an issue. Imagine: a politician, paid by YOUR tax dollars, saying you should buy a new one when the old one breaks, because he can. \n\nHe can afford to buy a new one, when the old one breaks. He got voted out of office soon thereafter, a fitting followup to his \"let them eat cake\" comment. \n\nThere is a chance to get this done this session. The biggest opposition is gone. Let's make it happen. I need your help to get it done. Overcome your cynicism for talking to politicians for a moment. If I can, so can you!\n\nTHANK YOU!!!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50cAYRe7mo0", "date_published": "2021-05-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w", "title": "NYC real estate prices are being ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED by non-disclosure agreements.", "description": "https://tinyurl.com/rossmatrix\nRemember, it's not lying; it's commercial real estate. https://official-rossmann-merch.creator-spring.com/listing/real-estate-in-nyc?product=658", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Trz65P1gnA", "date_published": "2021-05-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w", "title": "got 'em :(", "description": "https://tinyurl.com/rossmatrix\nI use this 360 cam program.
