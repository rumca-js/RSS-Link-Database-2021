They have MIDI CC1 mapped to a knob, which the Hermod accepts, records, and passes through as modulation CV\n* You can use the Digitakt LFOs to modulate CC1, or record this into the Hermod as a modulation lane, which will now be part of the sequence\n* This is a very flexible and fun way to play with modular!\n\nSquarp Hermod: http://bit.ly/pc_hermod\nTip-Top Z5000: http://bit.ly/pc_z5000\nNoise Engineering Cursus Iteritas: http://bit.ly/pc_cursus\n\n00:00 dark house\n07:00 aggressive breaks\n10:41 chemical downtempo\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching. My name is Jeremy, and this is Red Means Recording. I've been making music for a few decades now, and this channel is a place to make music and to talk about the tools and techniques to make music with. We'll use synths, drum machines, modular gear, and software. \n\nIf you'd like to support the channel, I have a Patreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nI have music as \"Jeremy Blake\" on all the major services: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nI have some merch here: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nAnd you can connect with me here: \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8trUttnyAgE", "date_published": "2021-05-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
