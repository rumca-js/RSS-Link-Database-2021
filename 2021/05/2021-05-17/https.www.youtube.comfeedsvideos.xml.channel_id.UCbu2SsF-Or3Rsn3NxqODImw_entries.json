From its genre defining breakthrough in 1996, to the co-op Hollywood action packed Resident Evil 6, the franchise has attempted a lot of different things over the years -- some more successful than others.\n\nOver its 25 years, Resident Evil cemented the survival horror genre, revolutionized the third person shooters with Resident Evil 4\u2019s influential perspective, and managed to bring survival horror back into the mainstream once again with Resident Evil 7. Village encapsulates all of that, and more, pushing the franchise into new heights while doubling down on everything from the series\u2019 past.\n\nIn the above video, Kurt Indovina ties every element back to where it was previously introduced in the franchise. From Lady Dimitrescu to Resident Evil 3\u2019s iconic Nemesis replicated with Lady Dimitrescu, to its convoluted lore with Mother Miranda, and its similarities to CODE: Veronica. While there\u2019s plenty of similarities to Resident Evil 4, some aren\u2019t as apparent as others, like the ghost dolls from House Beneviento, and its direct inspiration from RE4\u2019s unreleased prototype codenamed the \u201cHallucination\u201d version, which featured creepy porcelain dolls that protagonist Leon Kennedy had to fight.\n\nWatch the video to hear how Resident Evil Village managed to staple together 25 years of Resident Evil.\n\nCheck out our other Resident Evil content!\nResident Evil Village Ending Explained: https://youtu.be/uQ-zJhZczZk\nThe Complete Resident Evil Timeline Explained: https://youtu.be/QkPgowr-T9g\u00a0\nResident Evil Village Lore - The Lords: https://youtu.be/EL3nDFpCSyI", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-phrMMEqXkI", "date_published": "2021-05-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
