Let's use the Elektron Digitakt to sequence and modulate some Noise Engineering modules!

* Digitakt is playing back drums and samples on tracks 1-8
* Digitakt tracks 15 and 16 are set to send MIDI out on channels 15 and 16 to the Squarp Hermod
* The Hermod translates this data to CV and passes pitch and gate to the Noise Engineering Cursus and Manis Iteritas
* The Manis is passing through the Tip-Top z5000 fx unit for chorus, and the Cursus is going into the WMDSSF ADSRVCA for volume shaping
* Channels 9-14 on the Digitakt pass no note data. They have MIDI CC1 mapped to a knob, which the Hermod accepts, records, and passes through as modulation CV
* You can use the Digitakt LFOs to modulate CC1, or record this into the Hermod as a modulation lane, which will now be part of the sequence
* This is a very flexible and fun way to play with modular!
