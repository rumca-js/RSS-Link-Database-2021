Back in April 2019, the greatest stock trade in the history of the world was completed: MacKenzie Scott bought Amazon stock in 1993 - an entire year before the company was founded and sold in 2019, twenty-six years later for a staggering $35 billion in profit. But instead of buying and selling Amazon stock - it was through marrying Jeff Bezos (without a prenup) - and divorcing Jeff Bezos. 

Then there’s poor ol’ Elon - who didn’t go through just one pricey divorce - but three! The first was with Justine Musk. Elon had to pay at least $4 million dollars in legal and accounting fees, which comes out to $170,000 per month. 

Then came his second marriage with actress Talulah Riley. They divorced in 2012, leaving Riley with $4.2 million dollars. Then they made up, got married again and then divorced again a year later, leaving Riley with a much more respectable $16 million. 

Which brings us to Bill and Melinda Gates. Bill married Melinda on a Hawaiian Island around the same time as Bezos in 1994. Twenty-seven years later in 2021, they file for divorce and are still working out how much of the $130 billion dollar empire Melinda is gonna get. Bill has already given her $2.4 billion dollars worth of shares. 

Before you go calling all women gold diggers, unless you’re divorcing the ultra wealthy, usually neither the groom nor the bride comes out on top. Usually, in America, the real gold diggers that profit off of a divorce - are the divorce lawyers, the judges, the family courts.

Well, what most people don’t realize is that in America, marriage is not just a vow of love, but a financial contract.

You hire a divorce lawyer to protect yourself against your spouse taking your stuff. You pay maybe $600/hr, $700/hr, and maybe even more insane numbers. Why do people pay such high rates? Bc they’re desperate!

As a lawyer, you’re paid hourly, therefore, it’s in your best interest to keep the fighting going bc if your client’s divorce is settled, you lose your income stream.

The lawyers aren’t alone in this industry though, the other major players are the judges. And with great power - comes great opportunities to be bribed.

So if you do get married, maybe don’t follow in the steps of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk and get a prenup.
