Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAnamaria Sayre | May 27, 2021\nColombian reggaetonera Karol G floats between styles on this wistful Miami set with the breeziness of a pop star who knows no boundaries \u2013 or maybe it's the calculus of an artist who has built a career on subverting them. Her personal, unapologetic flourish has allowed her to top the Billboard charts of a genre with limited female participation, and even less superstardom.\n\nHer signature bichota energy is subtle, yet pervasive in her stripped-down Tiny Desk (home) concert. Flanked by an illuminated all-women band, Karol G's authentic command of the intimate moment and its intended audience is unmistakable. She's stepping down from atop the glossy sets and sparkly stages to share secrets \u2014 lessons learned during her sudden ascent about humility, grace and empowerment \u2014 with the millions of ni\u00f1itas who will watch this concert, enraptured by her effortless confidence and smooth Spanish bars.\n\nWithout a doubt, Karol G strikes a perfect balance here of vulnerability and star power, taking us on a journey through her many iterations. She deftly moves from a ballad-like rendition of urbano mash-up \"Cr\u00e9eme/A Ella\" to a soulful performance of trap corrido \"200 COPAS\" (her proclaimed favorite song at the moment) with Mexican Regional cari\u00f1o Danny Felix. Closing with a first-ever live performance of the dreamy duet \"CONTIGO VOY A MUERTE,\" she marks the end of the concert with a nod to her roots. Intertwined with fellow Colombiano Camilo, Karol G expresses gratitude and pride; she is the unguarded depiction of a superstar eternally enamorado with her fans and her country.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Cr\u00e9eme/A Ella\"\n\"200 COPAS\"\n\"CONTIGO VOY A MUERTE (feat.
