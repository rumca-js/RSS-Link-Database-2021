As a result, you lose a lot of the functionality of autopilot. Since it often takes a few weeks from the time you order the car to the time you take delivery, it is very possible you could've bought a model 3 or Y when they still had radar, but pick up a car that has no radar. \n\nWhen you go to take delivery, they will have you sign a waiver that you are ok with not having radar, which comes with decreased functionality - even though the car costs the SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. \n\nFeel free to do whatever you wish - but I think you should be informed before you make your decision. I am a total noob and would 100% fall for something like this if I were presented with some fine print shit to sign at time of delivery and be very pissed when I realized that I didn't get what I paid for. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/tesla-loses-us-designation-some-advanced-safety-features\n\ud83d\udd34 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-23/cars-are-about-to-get-a-lot-more-expensive-thanks-to-inflation-other-costs\n\ud83d\udd34 https://jalopnik.com/teslas-removing-radar-for-semi-automated-driving-on-mod-1846976679\n\ud83d\udd34 https://twitter.com/talesftf/status/1397799057234567169/photo/1\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This video was recorded with the following:\n\ud83d\udd35 Camera: https://amzn.to/3eO58my\n\ud83d\udd35 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2GoiSb0\n\ud83d\udd35 HDMI capture: https://amzn.to/3cMzhRq\n\ud83d\udd35 Audio interface: https://amzn.to/2SiCG1W", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROeTm1sxeFI", "date_published": "2021-05-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
