Tesla removed radar from the lower end models. As a result, you lose a lot of the functionality of autopilot. Since it often takes a few weeks from the time you order the car to the time you take delivery, it is very possible you could've bought a model 3 or Y when they still had radar, but pick up a car that has no radar. 

When you go to take delivery, they will have you sign a waiver that you are ok with not having radar, which comes with decreased functionality - even though the car costs the SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. 

Feel free to do whatever you wish - but I think you should be informed before you make your decision. I am a total noob and would 100% fall for something like this if I were presented with some fine print shit to sign at time of delivery and be very pissed when I realized that I didn't get what I paid for.
