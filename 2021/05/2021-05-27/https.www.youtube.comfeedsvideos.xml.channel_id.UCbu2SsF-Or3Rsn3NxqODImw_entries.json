Here\u2019s everything we know so far about the upcoming Far Cry 6.\u00a0\n\nFar Cry 6 is set to release October 7th, 2021 and Ubisoft revealed some new details about the game\u2019s extensive weapon and vehicle systems. In this video, you\u2019ll learn about the new weapon categories including the Regular, Resolver, and Supremos. According to the devs, there are 49 guns in the game that range from leftover revolutionary weapons like the SKS and M16 to over-the-top homebrew varieties like a minigun built from motorcycle parts, and a CD launcher that that plays Macarena. Far Cry 6 also sees the return of pets, two of which are an aggressive alligator named Guapo and a cute Weiner dog named Chorizo, who is lethal in its own way.\n\nThe island of Yara itself has been isolated for fifty years and has a number of biomes like swamps, towns, jungles, and cities with skyscrapers and underground areas. To travel around players can expect a variety of options including guerilla trails, horses, Mad-Max-style technicals, and even a tank. Flying over the island will be limited until Anti Aircraft batteries are destroyed. Players can also expect many of Far Cry\u2019s usual activities including taking over bases and engaging in side-activities with different characters.\u00a0\n\nAs we approach E3 2021 and a new Ubisoft Forward event in June, we expect to learn a lot more about the plot of Far Cry 6, the motivation for its main villain Anton Castillo, who is played by actor Giancarlo Esposito. We also hope to learn a lot more about how his son Diego may or may not succumb to the dictator and his brutal tactics.
