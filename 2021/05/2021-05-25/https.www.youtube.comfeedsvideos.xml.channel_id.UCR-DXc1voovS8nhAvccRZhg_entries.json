Long live IRC?", "description": "The past couple weeks have had quite the drama in the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) world. By far the largest IRC network, Freenode, has been embroiled in controversy surrounding the departure of a number of admins and volunteers.\n\nThe owner of Freenode since 2017, Andrew Lee, has taken some actions that have thrown more fuel on the fire, and the majority of major open source communities who have called Freenode home for many years\u2014decades, even\u2014have left for other networks, most notably Libera.Chat.\n\nHow will this impact IRC usage overall?
