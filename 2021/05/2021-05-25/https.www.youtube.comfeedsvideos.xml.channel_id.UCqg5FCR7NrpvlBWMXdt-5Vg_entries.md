Christopher Nolan's films are renowned for their use of practical effects and their dependency on internal rules and structures. However, these elements of Nolan's films exist at odds with their meditations on more existential themes. Like many of Nolan's movies, TENET is an exploration of the challenges in trying to understand something that past the limits of human comprehension. TENET is a movie about the importance of faith in the face of a chaotic and uncertain universe.
