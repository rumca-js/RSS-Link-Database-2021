From long-range shots to 360 no scopes, it\u2019s time to take a look at why sniper rifles often struggle to translate to video games.\n\nSniper rifles have a rocky history in video games like Call Of Duty, Battlefield, and other multiplayer shooters. The complex physics of real-world long-range shooting is fundamentally too difficult to translate to video games, leading developers to both simplify sniper rifles and also exaggerate their drawbacks to keep them balanced.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to look at what sniper rifles are, how they are used in games, the extreme compromises used to balance them, some things developers aren\u2019t trying to make easier, and what happens when they are forced onto small maps. We\u2019re also just going to marvel at the skill of some players who can quickscope and even do 360 no scopes.\u00a0\n\nIf you love multiplayer shooters, make sure to head over to GameSpot\u2019s YouTube page to watch our Firearms Expert Reacts series, our coverage of Call Of Duty: Cold War\u2019s mid-season 3 update that includes Rambo, and ongoing coverage up to the release of Battlefield 6.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz59NAn-fyU", "date_published": "2021-05-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
