Mary Lucia talks about the documentary on PBS American Masters about Amy Tan, the author, called "Unintended Memoir." Amy Tan is the author of "The Joy Luck Club," which was a massive book, recalling her Chinese American upbringing as a modern American, and going back to tell the stories of her mother and aunts and grandmothers. 

Tan has published so many more books since "The Joy Luck Club," and she is just a wildly imaginative woman and very thoughtful and intelligent. "Unintended Memoir" is truly a story about her life. It's directed by James Redford, and you can find it on PBS stations or on the PBS app.
