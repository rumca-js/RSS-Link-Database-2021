Disinformation around the COVID-19 pandemic, measures taken to contain it and vaccine roll-out campaigns continues to be significant. 

vaccine-related disinformation increased and contributed to spreading fear and mistrust in any type of vaccine.

since the beginning of 2021 state-sponsored disinformation also intensified, targeting in particular Western-developed vaccines.

Russia and China, in particular, continue to intensively promote their own state-produced vaccines around the world. 

is combined with disinformation and manipulation efforts to undermine trust in Western-made vaccines, EU institutions and Western/European vaccination strategies. 

Both Russia and China are using state-controlled media, networks of proxy media outlets and social media, including official diplomatic social media accounts, to achieve these goals.

Q, Katie Sanders

are you still confident that it developed naturally?

A, Dr Fauci

No actually 

I am not convinced about that

I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened

Certainly, the people who investigated it say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then infected individuals

but it could have been something else, and we need to find that out

greater clarity about the origins of this pandemic is necessary and feasible to achieve 

We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data. 

A proper investigation should be transparent, objective, data-driven, inclusive of broad expertise, subject to independent oversight

theories of accidental release remained viable
