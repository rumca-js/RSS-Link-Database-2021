It's directed by James Redford, and you can find it on PBS stations or on the PBS app.\n\nWatch more from Mary Lucia in the video above.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#amytan #marylucia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j17KgtVEd50", "date_published": "2021-05-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Robert Finley - two live performances (2018; 2017)", "description": "On Friday, May 21, 2021, Robert Finley released \"Sharecropper's Son,\" his third album and one described as career defining.
