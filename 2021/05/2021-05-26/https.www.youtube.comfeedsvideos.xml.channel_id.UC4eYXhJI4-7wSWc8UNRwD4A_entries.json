Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAnamaria Sayre | May 27, 2021\nColombian reggaetonera Karol G floats between styles on this wistful Miami set with the breeziness of a pop star who knows no boundaries \u2013 or maybe it's the calculus of an artist who has built a career on subverting them. Her personal, unapologetic flourish has allowed her to top the Billboard charts of a genre with limited female participation, and even less superstardom.\n\nHer signature bichota energy is subtle, yet pervasive in her stripped-down Tiny Desk (home) concert. Flanked by an illuminated all-women band, Karol G's authentic command of the intimate moment and its intended audience is unmistakable. She's stepping down from atop the glossy sets and sparkly stages to share secrets \u2014 lessons learned during her sudden ascent about humility, grace and empowerment \u2014 with the millions of ni\u00f1itas who will watch this concert, enraptured by her effortless confidence and smooth Spanish bars.\n\nWithout a doubt, Karol G strikes a perfect balance here of vulnerability and star power, taking us on a journey through her many iterations. She deftly moves from a ballad-like rendition of urbano mash-up \"Cr\u00e9eme/A Ella\" to a soulful performance of trap corrido \"200 COPAS\" (her proclaimed favorite song at the moment) with Mexican Regional cari\u00f1o Danny Felix. Closing with a first-ever live performance of the dreamy duet \"CONTIGO VOY A MUERTE,\" she marks the end of the concert with a nod to her roots. Intertwined with fellow Colombiano Camilo, Karol G expresses gratitude and pride; she is the unguarded depiction of a superstar eternally enamorado with her fans and her country.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Cr\u00e9eme/A Ella\"\n\"200 COPAS\"\n\"CONTIGO VOY A MUERTE (feat.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nLyndsey McKenna | May 26, 2021\nSince last year, many musicians have had to confront their own version of the \"if a tree falls in a forest\" thought experiment: If you release a new album but can't tour, will the music still resonate for listeners stuck at home? On their superb 2020 album, Skeletons, Brothers Osborne \u2014 a country duo that's long challenged the conventions of country and still managed to top the charts \u2014 intentionally turned up the volume to create a stadium-sized sound. The problem? \"We put it out and performed it nowhere,\" John Osborne told Morning Edition.\n\nFor their Tiny Desk (home) concert, brothers John and T.J. scale to fit the setting \u2013 John's wood-panelled Nashville living room furnished with plenty of guitars and a tiny desk featuring a Maryland flag mug \u2013 but refuse to dial down the intensity. Opening with the explosive instrumental track \"Muskrat Greene,\" Brothers Osborne and their collaborators use their set to showcase the very best of Skeletons. As on the record, they transition immediately into \"Dead Man's Curve,\" a track that's the ideal interplay between John's fiery guitar and T.J.'s singular vocal stylings.\n\n\"I hope it's good,\" T.J. confesses near the concert's conclusion. \"We really haven't been performing a lot for obvious reasons.\" If John and T.J. can create this incendiary of an experience from a living room, just imagine hearing the anthems \"I'm Not For Everyone\" and \"Hatin' Somebody\" surrounded by thousands of fellow fans this fall.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Muskrat Greene\"\n\"Dead Man's Curve\"\n\"I'm Not For Everyone\"\n\"Skeletons\"\n\"Hatin' Somebody\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJohn Osborne: electric guitar, vocals\nT.J.
