Her voice rarely rises above a whisper as she sings over impassioned Afrobeats during her three-song set \u2014 but when it does, it's a gritty, intimidating growl. Carmona got her start in 2013 when the Latin soul singer-songwriter released her first EP and opened for Beyonc\u00e9's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in Puerto Rico.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"When I Was Your Girl\"\n\"Ella Se Mueve\"\n\"Vibra\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCalma Carmona: vocals\nPedro \"PJ\" Gonz\u00e1lez: guitar\nAdri\u00e1n \"AJ\" Rodr\u00edguez: bass\nJ.

The album, much like the Brazillian singer-songwriters's Tiny Desk performance, is a respite from these times. Elements of jazz and blues are infused with African rhythms as Luna uses music to express her ongoing struggles for autonomy as a Black woman. She performs from her coastal hometown of Bahia in the city of Salvador, Brazil, where African culture flows in abundance. Luna is a powerhouse, entrancing and elegant, soulful and spiritual, as she uses her platform to discuss individual and systemic forms of anti-Blackness.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Len\u00e7ois\"\n\"Erro\"\n\"Choror\u00f4\"\nMUSICIANS\n\nLuedji Luna: vocals\nWeslei Rodrigo: bass\nSergio Machado: drums\nGabriel Gaiardo: keys\nVinicius Sampaio: guitar\nCREDITS\n\nVideo: Flow Creative Core, Aline Juliet, Kadu Borges, Dilson Laguna\nAudio: Andr\u00e9 Ramos\nScenographer: Juliana Laguna\nExecutive Producer: Gabriel Ramos\nAssistant Producer: Reginaldo Vilela\nTINY DESK TEAM\n\nProducer: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM_ARaGik3o", "date_published": "2021-05-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
