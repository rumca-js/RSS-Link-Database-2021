We look at the iconic weapon type\u2019s struggle with nerfs, buffs, and finding a purpose.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMultiplayer shooters like Call Of Duty and Battlefield have a large number of weapon classes including assault rifles, submachine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, and even rocket launchers. In-game weapons often channel the spirit of their real-world counterparts, such as SMGs being high rate-of-fire weapons that are great at close range but weak at a distance. One gun in particular has a lot of challenges translating to video games. The light machine gun is a weapon primarily designed to keep opponents\u2019 heads down and instill fear. With the ability to respawn and try again, players in multiplayer shooters are generally not afraid to stick their head out, leading developers to explore creative solutions for what role the LMG should serve.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to look at what a light machine gun is, why they often don\u2019t translate to games, types of suppression developers have tried, what happens when LMGs stray into other classes and get nerfed, how they fare in battle royale modes, and some creative implementations of the weapon. We\u2019ll show off some of your favorites such as the M60 from Battlefield Bad Company and the RPD from Modern Warfare 2. We\u2019re also going to explore why Lord Tachanka was the absolute worst character in Rainbow Six Siege until he was reworked recently.\n\nMake sure to head on over to GameSpot\u2019s YouTube page for ongoing coverage of Call Of Duty: Warzone seasons and announcements around the release of the next Battlefield game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUO3xBsO36c", "date_published": "2021-05-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "37 Minutes of Resident Evil Village PC Demo Gameplay", "description": "We try out the Resident Evil Village Demo on PC.

There's no shortage of lore in the series\u2014it's incredibly dense with it\u2014so if you're new to Mass Effect, here's a primer to get you started. Or, if you're a veteran fan, a way to refresh your memory before you play the remaster.\n\nIn the above video, Jordan Ram\u00e9e discusses the fascinating history of the ferocious Krogan: a species bred for war. From the unusual anatomy that makes them almost impossible to kill to their warmongering nature, the Krogan are regarded as the brutes of the galaxy, always spoiling for a fight.\n\nTheir nature made them very useful to the Citadel Council when faced with the Rachni, a species threatening to conquer the galaxy. Unfortunately, the Krogan ran rampant, conquering numerous planets and breeding faster than they could be killed. The solution: a genetic mutation called the Genophage, which was designed to cut birth rates among Krogan dramatically in order to keep them in check.\n\nThe Genophage plays a huge role throughout the Mass Effect trilogy and informs some of the biggest decisions the player has to make throughout the games.
