Cases, + 392,488 = 19,500,000

Deaths, + 3,689 = 215,542

Nevada, 7 cases of India variant, B.1.617

Six in Washoe County

One in Churchill County

Heather Kerwin, epidemiology program manager

Washoe County residents, did not appear to have travelled

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, B.1.617 not listed as VOI or VOC

Cambodia

Population, 15 million

Worst outbreak so far

All linked to B.1.1.7

Ban in inter-district travel

Mandatory masks

Night curfew 

Enforced lockdowns since 5th April

Red zones

All markets in Phnom Penh closed

Food often not delivered by government

First dose, 1.3 million

Longitudinal analysis shows durable and broad immune memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection with persisting antibody responses and memory B and T cells

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.19.21255739v1

Seattle and Atlanta

n = 254 COVID-19 patients

55% female, 45% male

Ages, 18-82 

Longitudinally from early infection and for eight months
found a predominant broad-based immune memory response

Spike binding and neutralizing antibodies exhibited a bi-phasic decay

With an extended half-life of more than 200 days

Suggesting the generation of longer-lived plasma cells

Sustained IgG+ memory B cell response

Bodes well for a rapid antibody response upon virus re-exposure

Virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were generated and maintained
Estimated half-life of 200 days

CD4+ T (helpers) cell response equally targeted several SARS-CoV-2 proteins

CD8+ T (cytotoxic) cell response preferentially targeted the nucleoprotein

Importance of including the nucleoprotein as a potential vaccine antigen

Follow up for next 3 years

Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the prepandemic period in Italy

Presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies

Blood samples of 959 asymptomatic individuals enrolled in a prospective lung cancer screening trial

Italy's first two cases of COVID-19 disease

January 30, 2020, two tourists from China in Rome

First laboratory-confirmed Italian COVID-19 case, Lombardy on February 20, 2020,

September 2019 to March 2020

SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies were detected in 111 of 959 (11.6%) individuals

IgM and some IgG

September 2019,  23/111

October,    27/111

November,   26/111

December,   11/111

January,    3/111

February,   21/111

Unexpected very early circulation of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals in Italy

At least one SARS-CoV-2–positive patient was detected in 13 regions

IgM antibodies were detected in 97 (10.1%) patients

IgG antibodies were found in 16 (1.7%)

All the patients were asymptomatic at the time of
blood sample collection.

First IgM detected 3rd September


Infection more widespread than believed

Therefore an overestimation of the mortality rate

Since November to December 2019

Many general practitioners began reporting severe respiratory symptoms in elderly
and frail people

Atypical bilateral bronchitis

(? organising pneumonia)

Attributed to aggressive forms of seasonal influenza.

Antibody Persistence through 6 Months after the Second Dose of mRNA-1273 Vaccine for Covid-19

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916?emp=marcom&utm_source=nejmlist&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=aomev2&utm_content=version-c

Moderna mRNA-1273 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 

Efficacy 94% in phase 3 trials

Durability of protection, 180 days after 2nd dose

Antibody activity remained high in all age groups at day 209

Results are consistent with convalescent patients with Covid-19 through 8 months after symptom onset 

Support the use of this vaccine in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic.
