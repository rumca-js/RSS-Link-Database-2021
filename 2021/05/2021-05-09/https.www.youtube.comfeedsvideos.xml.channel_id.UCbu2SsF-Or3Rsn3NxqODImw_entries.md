With Battlefield 6 around the corner, we take a look back at how destruction has evolved in the Battlefield franchise.

In a world where first person shooters are a dime a dozen, anyone who has played the original Battlefield games or grew up with later entries such as Battlefield 4 can tell you their favorite moments when interacting with the game’s use of destruction. What’s up all, I’m David, and destruction in Battlefield has to be one of my absolute favorite aspects of the franchise! From its first entry in Battlefield 1943 to the unreleased Battlefield 6, if there is one thing that the franchise will guarantee, it’s environmental destruction over the course of a match. Let’s take a look at how the series uses destruction and “levolution” and just what makes it so special. We’ll also take a quick moment to speculate on the rumors of what destruction in Battlefield 6 could look like. Now if you’re excited for Battlefield 6 make sure to like this video so we’ll know to prioritize coverage of the game.

This week our Mass Effect lore series takes a look at the Geth, once a subservient race of AI, forced to rebel, and their creators, the nomadic Quarians. 

Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is tantalisingly close, and whether it's your first time with the trilogy or you're a diehard fan, there's a lot of lore to digest. We've put together a series to catch you up to speed on the biggest and most important stories in the Mass Effect universe that happen before the first game, so you can jump into the Legendary Edition knowing all the whos, whats, and wheres in the Milky Way.

In the video above, Lucy takes you through the conflict between the Geth and the Quarians. At the start of Mass Effect, the Quarians are a nomadic tribe living on board a flotilla of ships, drifting from one place to the next, with no home. The Geth are threatening the peace of the galaxy, and are formidable foes for Shepard and their squad. But it wasn't always that way. What lead the Geth to turn on their creators, and what outcome does the Geth War have on the galaxy? Lucy delves into all this and more.

We have weekly Mass Effect lore videos up on the channel right now, so subscribe at youtube.com/GameSpot to get up to speed. Mass Effect: Legendary Edition launches on May 14 on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

There’s a lot to digest during the final hours of Resident Evil Village. So let’s get into the nitty gritty of all this, and explain exactly what went down, and the ripple effect it has on the rest of the series.

Resident Evil Village opens a huge can of moldy worms in its final hours that recontextualizes the entire franchise. It's also an ending that leaves many cliffhangers to explore in the future.

Ethan Winters has been through a lot since his trek through the bayou in Resident Evil 7, rescuing his missing wife Mia from the Baker household. As it turned out, Mia was working for a crime syndicate known as The Connections, which were responsible for looking after the bioweapon known as Eveline. It was Mia's job to be a caretaker for Eveline. Once Ethan and Mia escape the grasps of Eveline in the end of RE7, with the help of Chris Redfield, they're put into hiding in a European village so The Connections cannot find them, and during that time, Ethan and Mia start a family with their daughter Rose. All was well, that is until Chris Redfield shows up and murders Mia, and kidnaps Rose. But that's only the beginning of what this ending begins to explain.

In the above video, we dissect the motives behind Chris Redfield, and most importantly, the game's antagonist Mother Miranda, and the impact she has on the game's lore (which is very deep). We'll also piece together how Umbrella Corporations fits into Village, and the ripple effect that has on its other games, as well as future ones. Also, is Lady Dimitrescu actually a vampire? Watch the video to find out.
