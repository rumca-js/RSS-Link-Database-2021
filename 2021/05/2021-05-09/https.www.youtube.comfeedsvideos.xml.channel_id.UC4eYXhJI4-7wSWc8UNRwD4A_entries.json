Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | May 10, 2021\nAni DiFranco\u00a0has always done things her way, and for this Tiny Desk (home) concert, she\u2019s a one-woman team, filming and recording herself in the front hall of her New Orleans home and studio, Big Blue. The not-so-tiny desk you see in the hallway was her great grandfather\u2019s. Other personal items seen as we scan her home include a purple painting of a tree by her cousin Jim Mott and a portrait of a woman and ghostly girl by a painter named Renata. At the time of this recording, Ani was planning to move after more than 10 years at Big Blue, so this concert is likely one of the last performances to take place in that space.\n\nAni opened her set with \u201cEverest\u201d from the 1999 album,\u00a0Up Up Up Up Up Up,\u00a0a song that for me is about viewing life through different lenses and finding beauty. Next, she sings the title track to her 1995 album,\u00a0Not a Pretty Girl,\u00a0which shakes the shackles of stereotypes. Her final song for this (home) concert is from her 22nd album and her latest release,\u00a0Revolutionary Love.\u00a0The song brings compassion to troubled times by dismissing hatred -- or in her words, \u201cTo forgive but not forget.\u201d It\u2019s a message that shows the beauty and power of this artist, and her heart.\n\nSET LIST\n \u2022 \"Everest\"\n \u2022 \"Not a Pretty Girl\"\n \u2022 \"Revolutionary Love\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n \u2022 Ani DiFranco: vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\n \u2022 Video: Folkmonger Productions\n \u2022 Audio: Mike Napolitano\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n \u2022 Producer: Bob Boilen\n \u2022 Video Producer: Maia Stern\n \u2022 Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n \u2022 Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n \u2022 Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame\n \u2022 Executive Producer: Keith Jenkins\n \u2022 Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #anidifranco", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFS4_4Ji_-E", "date_published": "2021-05-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
