What do you do when you go from making north of $5,000 per scene, or $60,000 per month if you do just 3 scenes a week to a plebian $200 to maybe a thousand dollars a scene, where to even make a measly $30,000 a year

A platform called OnlyFans became a thing - which turned the industry completely upside down, cutting out almost all the middlemen, and putting the profits back in the hands of providers

This is the booming, genius, nutty economics of OnlyFans - a truly disruptive platform that merged the creator economy, with the you-know-what economy.

Instagram, along with YouTube, did something special that the world has never seen before. It allowed average everyday people to create a personal connection with their followers. To the point where you kinda feel like you’re “virtual friends” with your favorite YouTubers and Instagram influencers. OnlyFans was created as a natural bolt-on to Instagram’s free feed, as a subscription-only feed.

If standard YouTubers and Instagram influencers are kinda like your virtual friends, then you can think of OnlyFans models as kinda like your “virtual girlfriends”.
