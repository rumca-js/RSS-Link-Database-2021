respiratory tract infection\n\nEmerging evidence, vitamin D insufficiency is related to a higher risk of coronavirus infection and disease\n\nObjectives\n\nTo investigate the prospective association between habitual use of vitamin D supplements and risk of COVID- 19 infection\n\nAssociations according to levels of circulating and genetically predicted vitamin D\n\nMethods\n\nN = 8,297 adults\n\nRecords of COVID-19 test results from UK Biobank\n\n16 March 2020 to 29 June 2020\n\nResults\n\nOf the 8,297 adults, 1,374 (16.6%) tested positive\n\nVit D users, n = 363\n\nNon-vit D users,

1:1\n\nBlinded independent endpoint review committee\n\n\n\nParticipants\n\nN = 17,177 baseline seronegative participants\n\nUK, n = 8,948\n\nBrazil, n = 6,753\n\nSouth Africa, n = 1,476\n\nInfections

single standard dose\n\nFrom day 22 to day 90 = 76%\n\nProtection did not wane during this initial 3-month period\n\nAntibody levels were maintained during this 90-day period\n\nMinimal waning by day 90\n\nEfficacy with a longer prime-boost interval\n\nVE = 82.4% at 12+ weeks\n\nEfficacy with less than 6 week, prime-boost interval\n\nVE = 54.9%\n\nObservations supported by immunogenicity data\n\nBinding antibody responses more than 2-fold higher after an interval of 12 weeks or more\n\nCompared with and interval of less than 6 weeks\n\n(18-55 years)\n\nInterpretation\n\nUK single dose strategy, booster at 3 months\n\nis an effective strategy for reducing disease, \n\nand may be the optimal for rollout of a pandemic vaccine when supplies are limited in the short term\n\nIt is the dosing interval and not the dosing level which has a great impact on the efficacy of the vaccine\n\nLonger prime-boost intervals done with other vaccines such as influenza, Ebola and malaria.\n\nProfessor Andrew Pollard, Chief Investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial\nThese new data provide an important verification of the interim data that was used by more than 25 regulators including the MHRA and EMA to grant the vaccine emergency use authorisation\nIt also supports the policy recommendation made by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)\n for a 12-week prime-boost interval, as they look for the optimal approach to roll out, and reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose of the vaccine\n\nVaccinated people less contagious\n\nAnalyses of PCR positive swabs in UK\n\nVaccine may have substantial reducing effect on transmission of the virus\n\n67% reduction in positive swabs among those vaccinated", "link":
