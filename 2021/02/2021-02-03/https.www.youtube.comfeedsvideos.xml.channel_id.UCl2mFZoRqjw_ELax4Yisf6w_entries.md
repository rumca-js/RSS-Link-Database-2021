WSB devolved from a group that I actually looked to for advice in the past, to a cult-like mentality that ignores almost anything that doesn't support a hardline, never-sell narrative. I believe this is due to the exponential growth of the group combined with what seems to be a purge of the old moderation team. I watched them locate a stock that was at $4, and through legitimate analysis, point out why it may go to $400 - AND IT DID. Many refused to take the win. Last Wednesday, Thursday, & Friday, people who had the opportunity to make good on their win... didn't.
