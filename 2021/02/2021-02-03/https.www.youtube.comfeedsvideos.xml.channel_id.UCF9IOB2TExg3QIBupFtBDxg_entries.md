Habitual use of vitamin D supplements and risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection: a prospective study in UK Biobank (29th January, 2021)

https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcn/nqaa381/6123965

The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition

Background 

Vitamin D supplementation, lower risk of acute respiratory tract infection

Emerging evidence, vitamin D insufficiency is related to a higher risk of coronavirus infection and disease

Objectives

To investigate the prospective association between habitual use of vitamin D supplements and risk of COVID- 19 infection

Associations according to levels of circulating and genetically predicted vitamin D

Methods

N = 8,297 adults

Records of COVID-19 test results from UK Biobank

16 March 2020 to 29 June 2020

Results

Of the 8,297 adults, 1,374 (16.6%) tested positive

Vit D users, n = 363

Non-vit D users, n = 7,934

Unadjusted model

OR 0.78 (p = 0.105)

Adjustment for covariates

Age, sex, race, origin (outpatient or inpatient), blood-type, years of education, TDI, smoking, moderate drinking, physical activity, healthy diet score, use of any other supplements 

Inverse association emerged

Between habitual use of vitamin D supplements and risk of COVID-19 infection

OR, 0.66, (P = 0.038)

Habitual use of vitamin D supplements was significantly associated with a 34% lower risk of COVID-19 infection

No association with baseline blood vitamin D levels and risk of COVID-19 infection

Associations between the risk of COVID-19 infection and habitual use of other individual supplements

Vitamin D Deficiency and Outcome of COVID-19 Patients

Medical University Hospital Heidelberg, (September 2020)

Identification of modifiable prognostic factors may help to improve outcomes

N = 185, diagnosed and treated in Heidelberg

Median Vitamin D level was 16.6 ng/ml

Associations of vitamin D status with disease severity and survival

Vitamin D status assessed at first presentation

Deficient

25-hydroxyvitamin D (Calcifediol)
level less than 12 ng/mL ( less than 30 nM)

N = 41 (22%)

Median IL-6 levels at hospitalization were significantly higher 

70.5 versus 29.7 pg/mL

Insufficiency

Less than 20 ng/mL (less than 50 nM) 

N = 118 (64%)

Higher levels

N = 26

Median Vitamin D level was significantly lower in the inpatient versus the outpatient subgroup

Results

Median observation period of 66 days

93 (50%) patients required hospitalization

28 patients required ventilation

Including 16 deaths

Adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities

Deficiency was associated with higher risk of ventilation and death

Mechanical ventilation

HR 6.12

p less than 0.001

Death

HR 14.73

p less than 0.001

Other hazard ratios

Male, 1.69 2.5

Over 60, 3.2    7.7

Comorbidity, 2.7 5.3

Need for interventional studies

Cholecalciferol

Calcifediol

Active form of vitamin D3, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), calcitriol, is 
pluripotent hormone and important modulator of both innate and adaptive immunity

 Single Dose Administration, And The Influence Of The Timing Of The Booster Dose On Immunogenicity and Efficacy Of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) Vaccine

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3777268

Background

Approved for emergency use by MHRA

Two standard doses, 4 to 12 weeks

Pooled analysis of trials

Exploratory analyses, immunogenicity and efficacy of extended intervals

Priming and booster doses

Data after one dose

Methods

Phase III efficacy trials in the United Kingdom and Brazil

Phase I/II clinical trials in the UK and South Africa

Data cut-off, 7th December 2020

Over 18 years, randomised 1:1

Blinded independent endpoint review committee



Participants

N = 17,177 baseline seronegative participants

UK, n = 8,948

Brazil, n = 6,753

South Africa, n = 1,476

Infections after first dose

Positive infections, n = 619

Symptomatic infections, less than 14 days after dose, n = 332 (up by 201 from 131)






Primary analysis of overall vaccine efficacy

Including LD/SD and SD/SD groups, = 66.7% (57.4%,  74.0%)

Vaccine group

Hospitalisations = 0

Control group

Hospitalisations = 15






Hospitalisations after a single dose

Less than 22 days
2 in vaccination group, 7 in control group

More than 22 after first dose
0 in the vaccination group, 6 in the control group







Vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose

From day 22 to day 90 = 76%

Protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period

Antibody levels were maintained during this 90-day period

Minimal waning by day 90

Efficacy with a longer prime-boost interval

VE = 82.4% at 12+ weeks

Efficacy with less than 6 week, prime-boost interval

VE = 54.9%

Observations supported by immunogenicity data

Binding antibody responses more than 2-fold higher after an interval of 12 weeks or more

Compared with and interval of less than 6 weeks

(18-55 years)

Interpretation

UK single dose strategy, booster at 3 months

is an effective strategy for reducing disease, 

and may be the optimal for rollout of a pandemic vaccine when supplies are limited in the short term

It is the dosing interval and not the dosing level which has a great impact on the efficacy of the vaccine

Longer prime-boost intervals done with other vaccines such as influenza, Ebola and malaria.

Professor Andrew Pollard, Chief Investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial
These new data provide an important verification of the interim data that was used by more than 25 regulators including the MHRA and EMA to grant the vaccine emergency use authorisation
It also supports the policy recommendation made by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)
 for a 12-week prime-boost interval, as they look for the optimal approach to roll out, and reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose of the vaccine

Vaccinated people less contagious

Analyses of PCR positive swabs in UK

Vaccine may have substantial reducing effect on transmission of the virus

67% reduction in positive swabs among those vaccinated
