One year ago this week, rock band Temples visited our studio — one of just a handful of studio sessions we hosted in 2020 — to play some songs ahead of a sold-out show at the 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis. 

Lush arrangements and big-sounding guitars and keys give Temples a lot of room to create big sounds. "I think generally, we sort of know instinctively whether something should be lo-fi and echoey, or in your face and like a broken, fuzzy tape machine," Bagshaw said at the time. "It's one of those things where you follow your instinct, really."

Watch Temples perform three songs from their 2019 album, "Hot Motion."

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "The Howl"
4:26 "Holy Horses"
7:33 "You're Either On Something"

PERSONNEL
James Bagshaw – vocals, guitar

## Listen to Looch - spending quality time with John Lurie

Mary Lucia has a two-fer for you, thanks to musician, actor, painter and all-around interesting person John Lurie. HBO recently launched the series, "Painting with John," and two episodes in, Mary Lucia is completely charmed by it. And it reminds Mary of the earlier series from Lurie called "Fishing with John," in which Lurie goes on fishing trips with his friends, who include Dennis Hopper, Jim Jarmusch, Willem Dafoe and Tom Waits. "When somebody's that interesting and has a lot to say and offer, it's great," Mary says. "It's really charming."
