EQ and Compression are two of the frontline tools for getting a good mix, but they can be hard to wrap your head around. In this video, we take a look at the 3 initial offerings from the Focusrite and Sonible collaboration: FAST EQ, FAST Compressor, and FAST Reveal. How they work, how they teach, and how they can help you make better mix choices.
