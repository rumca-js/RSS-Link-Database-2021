September 1998, LTCM was out of options, everyone on Wall Street thought if they fell, the entire system would collapse. The hedge fund managers collected their sweet fees and profits this entire time, and when it came time to pay, they left the bag for the other banks to hold.\n\nSteve Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management. His name may sound familiar after the whole Gamestop mania. He walked away from one of the biggest insider trading scandals on Wall Street: In 2013, his original hedge fund, S.A.C. Capital Advisors plead guilty to insider trading\n\nGabriel Plotkin was one of the traders who received insider information. After S.A.C Capital pled guilty to insider trading and closed shop, Gabriel Plotkin would go on to create Melvin Capital, raising $1 billion, with a focus on short selling! After the Gamestop Short Squeeze, Melvin Capital lost 53%.\n\nKen Griffin founded Citadel, an American multinational hedge fund, the world\u2019s 9th largest hedge fund with over $34 billion under management and Citadel Securities, which is what\u2019s called a Market Maker. During the first half of 2020 alone, they doubled their profits to $4 billion in revenue thanks to increased trading and volatility. This makes Ken Griffin a powerful billionaire in the world of high finance.\n\nWhen you imagine a young, hyper successful, shark of an American Hedge Fund Billionaire - that\u2019s Chase Coleman. He was born into New York aristocracy and trained under a legendary hedge fund billionaire, Julian Robertson. At 25, his mentor handed him $25 million to start his own fund, Tiger Global Management.\n\nGeorge Soros became known as the man who broke the Bank of England and made a billion dollars in the process. In 1992, Soros started building his position against the British pound by borrowing pounds from British banks and hedge funds.\n\nYou know Jim Cramer? He used to be a hedge fund manager that was an expert at these dirty tactics, especially with short selling.
