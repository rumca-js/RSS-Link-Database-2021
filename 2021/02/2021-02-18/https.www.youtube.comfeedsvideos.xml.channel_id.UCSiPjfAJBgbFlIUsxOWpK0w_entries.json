Roy Orbison has a couple songs about dreaming, and his most popular one is called \"In Dreams.\" But between you and me...\"Dream\" is better. This is just...as good as it gets, I think. (So a fan just pointed out that this song is actually by Johnny Mercer. Whoops! That said, my cover is a cover of Roy Orbison's rendition. A cover of a cover :) But I wanted to at least credit the original songwriter here. Thanks for letting me know!)\n\nSave this song on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/2r3Yqkh\nFollow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/pomplamoosemusic\nBecome a patron of our music (to vote on the songs we cover and get merch and stuff like that): http://www.patreon.com/pomplamoose\n\nWords and music originally written by Johnny Mercer.\n\nCREDITS\n\nVocals, Acoustic Guitar: Nataly Dawn\nElectric Guitar:  Brian Green\nEngineer: Tim Sonnefeld \nAssistant Engineer: Trent Slatton\nMixing/Mastering: Caleb Parker\nDirector: George Sloan\nDP/Editor: Ricky Chavez\nCamera Operators: Merlin Showalter, Sammy Rothman, Ricky Chavez\n\nRecorded at Stagg Street Studio in Los Angeles.\n\n#Pomplamoose #IndieMusic #RoyOrbison #Dream\n\nLYRICS \n\nDream, when you're feeling blue\nDream, that's the thing to do\nJust watch the smoke rings rise in the air\nYou'll find your share of memories there\n\nSo dream, when the day is through\nDream, and they might come true\nThings never are as bad as they seem\nSo dream, dream dream\n\nDream, when the day is through\nDream, and they might come true\nThings never are as bad as they seem\nSo dream, dream dream", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEnWWfLzrTw", "date_published": "2021-02-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
