PSA: The chart in back says "HI THERE HELLO" and not "HIT HER" ðŸ¤¦ I went too hard on the blur effect and shouldn't have followed the traditional eye chart layout. That's my bad for trying to rush an easter egg in and not double-checking how it could be misread (especially on mobile.) I also misspelled HELLLO with three L's --- so yeah. This went great.
