Spektor moved to the United States as a grade-schooler. \"I came here with refugee status and as an immigrant,\" she told The Current's Jim McGuinn in 2017, \"so then you become part of this immigrant-refugee community, and you love America in this way that is different. There's a certain kind of way that a puppy that was born into a family loves the family, and there's a different way that a dog that's been sheltered and got rescued from the pound loves the family. I always feel like that \u2014 where I feel so much love and such a desire to protect the ideals of America.\"\n\nRegina Spektor visited our studio that year to perform a set of songs, including music from her 2016 album, \"Remember Us Into Life.\" That same year, Spektor performed on the American Public Media program \"Live From Here,\" in an episode recorded live at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle. Watch Regina Spektor's performances from that show.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Older and Taller\"\n3:32 \"Samson\"\n6:42 \"The Trapper and the Furrier\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nRegina Spektor \u2013 piano and vocals\nChris Thile \u2013 mandolin (on \"Older and Taller\")\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Ben Miller; American Public Media\nAudio: Sam Hudson\nProduction: Jeffy Hnilicka; Tom Campbell; American Public Media \n\nFIND MORE:\n2009 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2009/09/11/regina_spektor\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/03/26/regina-spektor-shares-an-expressive-set-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#reginaspektor", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3OBc8heqTQ", "date_published": "2021-02-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "The Hold Steady - Virtual Session", "description": "Jill Riley connects with Craig Finn and Franz Nicolay of The Hold Steady to hear a few live performances of tracks from their eighth studio album, Open Door Policy\u2014recorded at the Brooklyn Bowl.

One of the songs, \"The Bride's Dad,\" tells the story of something Leithauser and his wife witnessed at a friend's wedding in upstate New York five years prior. \"There was an uninvited, unwanted guest who turned out to be the bride's dad,\" Leithauser recalled. \"He got up on the stage and he gave this really awesome toast, that we loved, and he sang that song, 'Wild Mountain Thyme,' which I've always loved. He was sort of in tears when he was singing it, and I was so gripped \u2026 After he sang it, I was ready to burst out in applause, and then I realized we were the only ones who were charmed.\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"In a Black Out\"\n3:33 \"The Bride's Dad\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nHamilton Leithauser \u2013 guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark, Elijah Deaton-Berg\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2014 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/07/11/hamilton-leithauser-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/02/16/hamilton-leithauser-performs-a-solo-acoustic-set-at-the-current\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#hamiltonleithauser", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyu6wT3Mdec", "date_published": "2021-02-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
