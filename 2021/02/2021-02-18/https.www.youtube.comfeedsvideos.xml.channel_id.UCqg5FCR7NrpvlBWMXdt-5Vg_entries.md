When it comes to video games, it’s understandable that a lot of us have short attention spans. The general conversation tends to latch onto whichever new release is hot at the moment, discuss it in a whirlwind of opinions and emotions, and then quickly move on to whatever the next big thing might be. Because of this nonstop nature, it feels like some games just fall out of our public consciousness faster than they should, even when they sell millions of copies.
