There is no such thing as an \"under the table\" Bitcoin transaction and everything is eternally stored on the blockchain. Privacy coins like Monero give privacy to individuals, but even more importantly make minuscule taxation and regulation impossible in the way that Bitcoin is taxed. This is one of the reasons that I prefer Monero long-term. More cryptocurrency regulation means a greater importance of privacy coins like it.\n\nMy website: https://lukesmith.xyz\nPlease donate: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate\nGet all my videos off YouTube: https://videos.lukesmith.xyz\n\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.\nhttps://brave.com/luk005 Get the Brave browser.\nhttps://lbry.tv/$/invite/@Luke View my videos on LBRY.
