Happy birthday to Regina Spektor, born February 18 in Moscow. Spektor moved to the United States as a grade-schooler. "I came here with refugee status and as an immigrant," she told The Current's Jim McGuinn in 2017, "so then you become part of this immigrant-refugee community, and you love America in this way that is different. There's a certain kind of way that a puppy that was born into a family loves the family, and there's a different way that a dog that's been sheltered and got rescued from the pound loves the family. I always feel like that — where I feel so much love and such a desire to protect the ideals of America."

Regina Spektor visited our studio that year to perform a set of songs, including music from her 2016 album, "Remember Us Into Life." That same year, Spektor performed on the American Public Media program "Live From Here," in an episode recorded live at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle. Watch Regina Spektor's performances from that show.

## Hamilton Leithauser - two solo acoustic performances (2017)

Four years ago this week, Hamilton Leithauser was on tour, and he let his band sleep in while he visited The Current studio equipped with a nylon-string Spanish guitar to perform solo acoustic versions of heartstring-tugging tunes from "I Had a Dream That You Were Mine," his 2016 collaborative album with Rostam Batmanglij.

The solo versions of the songs, combined with the stories within them, lent Leithauser's in-studio set a sort of Bob Dylan vibe. One of the songs, "The Bride's Dad," tells the story of something Leithauser and his wife witnessed at a friend's wedding in upstate New York five years prior. "There was an uninvited, unwanted guest who turned out to be the bride's dad," Leithauser recalled. "He got up on the stage and he gave this really awesome toast, that we loved, and he sang that song, 'Wild Mountain Thyme,' which I've always loved. He was sort of in tears when he was singing it, and I was so gripped … After he sang it, I was ready to burst out in applause, and then I realized we were the only ones who were charmed."

SONGS PERFORMED
