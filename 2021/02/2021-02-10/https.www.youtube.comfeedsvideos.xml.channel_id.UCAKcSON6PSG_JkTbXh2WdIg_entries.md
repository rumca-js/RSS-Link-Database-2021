This week back in 2012, Zoo Animal performed in our studio. Zoo Animal is the music project headed by Holly Hansen — or perhaps more accurately, Zoo Animal is Holly Hansen. “When I started Zoo Animal, I thought of it as Cat Power,” Hansen told writer Cecilia Johnson in 2019. “When someone’s talking about Cat Power, they’re thinking about Chan Marshall. Cat Power’s just her name.”

Watch three performances by Zoo Animal recorded for The Current — including one performance from a Caravan du Nord show in Fergus Falls, Minn., from 2012.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Folded Hands" (2010)
1:58 "Black and Charred" (2012)
5:22 "Fyre" (2012, Caravan du Nord performance)

## Listen to Looch: a can't-miss documentary about Bob Marley
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zWI93WM-0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zWI93WM-0k)

There was a documentary made about Bob Marley a few years ago that's now available on Showtime, Hulu, Amazon Prime and YouTube to rent. It's simply called "Marley," and it is so amazing. It's beautiful. It's sad. But it's such an interesting look at somebody who was so much more than just a musician or the most famous musician to come from Jamaica.

Of course, the music is incredible. Marley was a poet. He was just one of those guys whom everyone describes as he just did everything 100 percent. 

Bob Marley — whose birthdate is February 6 — is such an icon, loved around the world, and this film was made with the support of the Marley family. It's directed by Kevin Macdonald, whose other films include "The Last King of Scotland" and "Whitney."
