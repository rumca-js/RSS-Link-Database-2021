Let’s take a look back at some of the most overpowered and infamous Akimbo guns that Call of Duty has ever offered.

For well over a decade, the Call of Duty games have featured the Akimbo system, letting you dual-wield weapons in order to absolutely litter your enemies with bullets and look very cool while doing it. Most of the time, this has worked as the designers intended, but there have been several instances where a weapon’s Akimbo form made it way too powerful. 

We rounded up some of the most broken Akimbo weapons in the history of Call of Duty--including that infamous lever-action shotgun. These weapons strike fear into the hearts of your enemies, especially if you run into them up close. 

Broken Akimbo weapons don’t seem to be going away, either, as we’ve seen them in nearly every entry in the series. This even includes a few weapons in the most recent game, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.
