Coordinated by Chinese officials

Mission to Wuhan, inconclusive

Chinese-WHO team

Coronavirus, most likely jumped from bats to an intermediary species

Virus could have been spreading around the world before it erupted in Wuhan in December 2019

WHO team reiterated that it is possible the virus was carried by frozen food

Emphatically ruled out a lab mishap, after talking to Wuhan lab

China's Global Times

Finally put an American conspiracy theory to rest

WHO visit showcased China's positive, scientific, cooperative attitude

Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control

Other locations in the world, particularly U.S. labs, must be investigated next

historically the United States … launched biological and chemical warfare

A WHO is now expected to move on to Southeast Asia, to explain origins

Peter Daszak, WHO delegation member

EcoHealth Alliance, coordinated U.S. grant funding to the WIV

Richard Ebright, microbiologist (Rutgers University)

Apparent conflict of interest
