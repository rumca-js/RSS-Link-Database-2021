She was celebrating who she was. I base a lot of my work around photographing women and trying to encourage self-acceptance, which is motivated by my own low confidence. I lived through the 90s and 00s heyday of gossip mags and size zero. So when I saw Nyome, who is confident in front of the camera and boldly herself as a plus-size black woman \u2013 a marginalised and censored group of people \u2013 I reached out because I really wanted to capture her.</p><p>She came to visit me in Cambridge in July, when we were recently out of the first lockdown. I shoot only with natural light, in a barn that is open to the elements along one side. I hang my backdrops in there, and the light enters from one direction only, like in studio photos. I prefer it because it creates the most beautiful, diffused light, with depth and a soft feel to it. I would never have thought it possible to create photos like this \u2013 you don\u2019t need a big fancy studio! Shooting out of a glorified shed is an ice-breaker, too. I have to move the bikes to one side and we\u2019re looking out into the garden with the dogs running about, which makes everyone relax and that has an impact on the photo.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/feb/10/model-instagram-apologise-nyome-nicholas-williams-alexandra-cameron-best-photograph\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/feb/10/model-instagram-apologise-nyome-nicholas-williams-alexandra-cameron-best-photograph", "date_published": "2021-02-10 16:35:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Hundreds of millions in green grants for English homes pulled despite delays", "description": "<p>95% of \u00a31.5bn set aside to improve houses unspent due to slowness in making grants and paying installers</p><p>The government\u2019s flagship programme for a green recovery is in turmoil after it was revealed that hundreds of millions of pounds are being withdrawn from its green homes grant programme.</p><p>Ninety-five per cent of the \u00a31.5bn pot provided for householders in England to make their homes less carbon intensive remains unspent due to long delays in giving out grants to householders and making payments to installers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/10/hundreds-of-millions-in-green-grants-for-english-homes-pulled-despite-delays\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/10/hundreds-of-millions-in-green-grants-for-english-homes-pulled-despite-delays", "date_published": "2021-02-10 15:10:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Climate action could save 'millions of lives' through clean air, diet and exercise", "description": "<p>Meeting Paris goals would bring health benefits aside from tackling global heating, research says</p><p>Thousands of lives lost to air pollution, inactivity and unhealthy diets could be saved each year if the UK takes the action needed to tackle climate change, researchers have said.</p><p>Across the world, millions of lives could be saved if countries raise ambitions on cutting emissions to limit global heating to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, as they have committed to in the global Paris climate accord.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/10/climate-action-could-save-millions-of-lives-through-clean-air-diet-and-exercise\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/10/climate-action-could-save-millions-of-lives-through-clean-air-diet-and-exercise", "date_published": "2021-02-10 12:53:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "From a vaccine manufacturer to an RAF clarinettist: meet four of the people working to vaccinate the nation", "description": "<p>Across the UK, people are coming together to help deliver the Covid-19 vaccine to those groups most at risk</p><p>When the first two Covid-19 vaccines were approved in the UK at the end of 2020, we were given a cautious glimmer of hope after almost a year into various lockdowns.
