Most of the time, this has worked as the designers intended, but there have been several instances where a weapon\u2019s Akimbo form made it way too powerful.\u00a0\n\nWe rounded up some of the most broken Akimbo weapons in the history of Call of Duty--including that infamous lever-action shotgun. These weapons strike fear into the hearts of your enemies, especially if you run into them up close.\u00a0\n\nBroken Akimbo weapons don\u2019t seem to be going away, either, as we\u2019ve seen them in nearly every entry in the series. This even includes a few weapons in the most recent game, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:26 - G18\n01:06 - Fennec\n01:53 - .44 Magnum\n02:31 - Saug 9mm\n03:05 - XMG\n03:54 - Model 1887\n04:41 - M93R\n05:17 - Rangers\n06:03 - HVR\n06:44 - FMG9\n07:33 - UMP45", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNfeRR6Vztk", "date_published": "2021-02-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Chivalry 2 - Beta Announce | Release Date | Dev Diary | Epic Games Store Spring Showcase", "description": "Check out this video on Chivalry 2 and its beta announcement coming to the Epic Games store featuring developer comments and reactions!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhzVwJEzot0", "date_published": "2021-02-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury Review", "description": "Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury packages one of the best recent Mario games with a delightfully odd new experience.\n\nNintendo's Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury will be available on Nintendo Switch on February 12, 2021.
