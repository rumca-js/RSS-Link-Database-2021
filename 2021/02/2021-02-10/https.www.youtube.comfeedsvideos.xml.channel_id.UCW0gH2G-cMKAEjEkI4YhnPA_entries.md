Morgoth Part 3! The epic conclusion to the tale of the original Dark Lord of Middle-earth!  In today's video, we pick up with Húrin, captured during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, as he and his family are cursed by Morgoth.  The Dark Lord presses his advantage, seeking to destroy the realms of Falas, Doriath, and the hidden city of Gondolin.  Eventually, Eärendil , the father of Elrond and Elros, comes to Aman to beg the valar for their intervention - resulting in the War of Wrath and the largest battle Middle-earth will ever see.
