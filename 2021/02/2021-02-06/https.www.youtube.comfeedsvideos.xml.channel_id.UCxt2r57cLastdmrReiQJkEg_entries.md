In this month's video, we're looking at cancel culture (or call-out culture or "public shaming" depending on your preference). In 2015, the pop-psychology writer Jon Ronson published a book called "So You've Been Publicly Shamed", which argued that the contemporary internet (Twitter most of all) had become an increasingly hostile place on which users would frequently gather together to ruin the lives of those with which they disagreed. Since then, this idea (which has since come to be referred to as "cancel culture") has gained popularity, with the media dedicating countless screen hours and column inches to worrying about the "online mob".

Concerns about cancel culture reached fever pitch in 2020. It was the year which both saw the publication of the "Harper's letter" and J.K. Rowling receiving backlash for doubling-down on her problematic rhetoric.

As ever, we're going to be taking the longer view, considering what these contemporary fears about woke "Twitter mobs" might inherit from historical fears about physical ones.
