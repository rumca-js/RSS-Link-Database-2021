No evidence for changes in symptoms from UK variant

1.76 million users between 28th September and 27th December 2020

Using longitudinal symptom and test reports, n = 36,920

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.21250680v1

First identified in December 2020 in the south east of England

Studied association between the regional proportion of B.1.1.7 and reported symptoms, disease course, rates of reinfection, and transmissibility 

Disease severity

No evidence of an association between B.1.1.7 and number of symptoms reported

No evidence of increased number of hospitalisations

Counter evidence

SAGE meeting paper, 21st January 

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/955239/NERVTAG_paper_on_variant_of_concern__VOC__B.1.1.7.pdf

There is a realistic possibility that VOC B.1.1.7 is associated with an increased risk of death compared to non-VOC viruses. 

Disease duration

No evidence for change

Reported symptoms

No difference in symptoms reported

No difference in symptom duration

No difference in proportion of asymptomatic case 


Claire Steves on symptoms

It’s important to emphasise the range of symptoms both the new and the old variant can cause, 

such as headaches and sore throat, 

in addition to the classic triad of cough, fever and loss of smell

Likely reinfection rate

Positive tests results from 36,509

304 reported two positive tests more than 90 days apart, 249 identified as reinfection

No difference in reinfection reporting rates across the different NHS regions

Around 0.7%

95% CI 0.6-0.8

No evidence that this was higher compared to older strains

Tim Spector on reinfection

It’s reassuring that reinfections are still really rare many months after previous infection, suggesting that both natural immunity and vaccines will be effective against this new strain

Increase in R(t)

By a factor of 1.35 

Regional and national lockdowns have reduced R(t) below 1 in regions with very high proportions of B.1.1.7

Tim Spector

This research highlights the unique value of the ZOE app in understanding the impact of new coronavirus variants across the population in a matter of weeks,

and we need our app users to help us maintain vigilance against further new strains as they emerge


SA VOC in UK

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55967767

About 100 cases in the UK

Oxford A/A vaccine offers limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by SA variant

AstraZeneca, not yet been able to properly establish if prevention of severe disease and hospitalisation

Current data mostly from young and healthy adults

AZ confident it will protect against serious cases

Similar neutralising antibodies still work


Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine

Working on a new vaccine designed to combat the South African variant

This year we expect to show that the new version of the vaccine will generate antibodies that recognise the new variant

It looks very much like it will be available for the autumn

We're already working on the first part of the manufacturing process in Oxford

that will be passed on to other members of the manufacturing supply chain as we go through the spring


Onset of protection

200,000 reports from vaccinated people

After 12 days, 53% reduction in new cases compared to non-vaccinated controls

First post trial data the vaccines are working after first shot

No protection at all for first 12 days

Spread of new variants

UK, SA, two Brazilian variants

UK variant, (Pathogenic Surveillance)

https://www.rivm.nl/en/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/research/pathogen-surveillance

Week of 11th to 17th January, 19.8% UK variant

Week of 27 January to 2 February, about two-thirds

South Africa variant

Found 23 times

Most had epidemiological links

Brazilian variants

P1 variant, 2 people who recently visited Brazil

P2 variant, 3 people, two with no travel history

Reproduction number on 15th January

Below 1 overall

Old variant, 0.86

UK variant, 1.28

It can therefore be deduced that the UK variant is more contagious


Current restrictions

Lockdown and curfew

CDC, loosen measures now, hospitals are at risk of being overrun by March

Cases down 70% since New Year peak 

February 5, 2021

Daily average UK symptomatic cases, + 20,360

Based on swab tests data from up to five days ago

Around one million weekly reporters

The proportion of newly symptomatic users who have positive swab tests

Data from 15,286 recent swab tests done between 17 to 31 January 2021.

Week before, + 28,645

Down 29%. 

Peak of 1st January, + 69,000

Down 70%

UK Prevalence

One in 170 people in the UK currently symptomatic
(ONS, W/E 30th January, 1 in 65)


Dorset, Bournemouth, Christchurch, Poole, 1 in 100

London, 1 in 102

Liverpool City Region, 1 in 122 

The UK R value is 0.9

England, 0.9, Wales, 0.9, Scotland, 0.9 

East Midlands, R = 1.0

Cases are coming down in all age groups


France (Anthony)

Just a short note today, awaiting this week’s government pow wow announcement as to whether 

France are actually going to do anything about the imminent growing problem of the 

UK Variant

Now growing 60% week on week

Now 14% of all cases.

Only 5 or 6% last week
 
Yet still they are avoiding lockdown as the country as usual is 50/50 split on it

Très bonne soiree


US, Reducing new infections

Natural infections + vaccinations 

Post-holiday surge is probably over

Reduced travel

Millions of individual and family behaviours

Gatherings down

Mask wearing normalised

Memorial Day in May

Any gatherings will cause contagious variants to spread

VOC driven increase in cases, April 

Herd immunity coming, but not yet

US, CDC data

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases

Past 7 days

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=sf_coronavirus

New daily reported cases, down 18.8%

New daily reported deaths, up 0.3%

CoViD related hospitalizations, down 14.1% (86,373)

Test positivity rate, 7.4%

Vaccine doses since 14th December, 38,326,000

Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation

University of Washington

Forecasts include vaccine distribution and the presence of the B.1.1.7

IF widespread transmission of the B.1.351 (South Africa VOC)

IF Mobility returning to pre-pandemic levels in the vaccinated

(67% reduction in positive swabs among those vaccinated, Oxford AZ, one dose)

Approximately 654,000 total deaths by May 1

Without transmission of B.1.351, deaths drop to 595,000 deaths by May 1

Resurgence, spring in some states, California and Florida

Keeping mobility low and maintaining social distancing, 30,000 less deaths

Christopher Murray, director of IHME

Getting vaccines out quickly is essential, 

and masks are still one of the best tools we have to keep transmission low

People will need to continue taking precautions even once they are vaccinated, 

Factors

Some states are not re-imposing social distancing mandates even when daily death rates are high

Herd immunity, unlikely to slow transmission in the coming months

Higher levels of immunity are needed with a more contagious variant

IHME’s forecasts predict only 38% of people in the US will be immune by May 1.

Worst-case scenario, third wave next winter

Governments and the public need to plan for the real prospect that COVID-19 must be managed on an ongoing basis

It’s critical to vaccinate as many people as possible

and to prepare for long-term behaviour change
