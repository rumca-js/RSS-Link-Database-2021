reported\n\nNo difference in symptom duration\n\nNo difference in proportion of asymptomatic case \n\n\nClaire Steves on symptoms\n\nIt\u2019s important to emphasise the range of symptoms both the new and the old variant can cause, \n\nsuch as headaches and sore throat, \n\nin addition to the classic triad of cough, fever and loss of smell\n\nLikely reinfection rate\n\nPositive tests results from 36,509\n\n304 reported two positive tests more than 90 days apart, 249 identified as reinfection\n\nNo difference in reinfection reporting rates across the different NHS regions\n\nAround 0.7%\n\n95% CI 0.6-0.8\n\nNo evidence that this was higher compared to older strains\n\nTim Spector on reinfection\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring that reinfections are still really rare many months after previous infection, suggesting that both natural immunity and vaccines will be effective against this new strain\n\nIncrease in R(t)\n\nBy a factor of 1.35 \n\nRegional and national lockdowns have reduced R(t) below 1 in regions with very high proportions of B.1.1.7\n\nTim Spector\n\nThis research highlights the unique value of the ZOE app in understanding the impact of new coronavirus variants across the population in a matter of weeks,\n\nand we need our app users to help us maintain vigilance against further new strains as they emerge\n\n\nSA VOC in

cases\n\nSimilar neutralising antibodies still work\n\n\nProf Sarah Gilbert, Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine\n\nWorking on a new vaccine designed to combat the South African variant\n\nThis year we expect to show that the new version of the vaccine will generate antibodies that recognise the new variant\n\nIt looks very much like it will be available for the autumn\n\nWe're already working on the first part of the manufacturing process in Oxford\n\nthat will be passed on to other members of the manufacturing supply chain as we go through the spring\n\n\nOnset of protection\n\n200,000 reports from
