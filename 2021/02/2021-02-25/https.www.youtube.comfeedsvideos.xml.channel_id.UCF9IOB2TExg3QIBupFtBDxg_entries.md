YPV result, 22 ng/ml

NHS result, 84.4 nmol/L = 33.76 ng/ml

Total vitamin D levels above 220 nmol/L are considered ‘High’ and increase the risk of vitamin D toxicity

220 nmol/L = 88 ng/ml

Primary school children are the lowest risk both to themselves and to society

Children are half to a third as likely to acquire the virus

When it comes to transmitting they are probably half as likely to transmit it as adults

That risk actually gets smaller as you go into younger age groups

I am not a great fan of young children wearing face masks

If I had to invest in a single activity to improve the environment both for the children and the adults, I'd be looking at improving the ventilation, 

unsealing windows that have been painted shut and kept shut for energy-saving reasons

That would be a much more effective way to reduce transmission in schools

BNT162b2 mRNA

Vaccine effectiveness in healthcare worker

Prospective cohort study of staff undergoing regular asymptomatic testing.

The SIREN study

N = 29,378

2 weekly intervals

Records symptoms, PCR and antibody test results

Therefore symptomatic and asymptomatic infections

Hazard ratios to compare time

Infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated groups


Findings, 5th February 2021

People who were antibody negative on recruitment

A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, effectiveness of 72%

21 days after first dose

Rising to 86% seven days after two doses

Conclusion

Vaccine effectively prevents both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working age adults

Cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B1.1.7

Consistent data

Israel, Norwich Medical School 

Pfizer COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine, after a single dose, ‘real-world’

At day 21

Vaccine effectiveness, 91%

After day 21

Remained at 90%

Expected to last form 9 weeks to 6 months

Vaccine effectiveness seems to be better at reducing severe disease that at reducing mild disease

Public health Scotland

Fourth week after first dose, reduced risk of hospitalisation

Pfizer, down 84% (n = 650,000) 

Oxford-AstraZeneca, down 94% (n = 490,000)

Combined reduction in over 80s

Vaccination associated with 81% reduction in hospitalisation risk in the fourth week
