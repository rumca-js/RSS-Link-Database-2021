See the differences between the current gen and previous gen versions of Outriders' prologue.

The demo for Outriders is now out, allowing you to play through the opening hours of developer People Can Fly's upcoming multiplayer-focused action RPG. You can play the demo on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC--the only system that doesn't support the demo but will play the game at launch is Stadia.

In the video above, we do a side-by-side comparison of the Outriders demo, playing it both on PS4 and PS5. We take a look at how well the game performs on the two systems, both in terms of graphical quality and loading times.

In Outriders, you play as an Outrider, a specialized combat scout charged with leading humanity's exploration across a new world after the destruction of Earth. Mutated by a freakish storm upon your arrival, you become an Altered--someone who can bend the elements to their will. You have the choice of commanding earth, fire, time, or technology. 

The demo for Outriders covers the opening chapter, which includes several campaign missions and optional side quests. Your progress in the demo will transfer over to the full game once it launches on April 1. Like that version, the Outriders' demo supports co-op, allowing you to team up with other players in three-person squads.

Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Season 2’s newest Zombies mode Outbreak is available to play (offline) a little ahead of schedule. Here's how escort and high-value target objectives work.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are entering Season 2 with a new battle pass that focuses on zombies. Based on recent trailers, zombies are expected to invade both the Dirty Bomb maps and Warzone. Currently, in Warzone, the developers are building unanswered mysteries such as a dark ship approaching the shore, and an inactive Trail Computer from Zombies has been found. 

In this video, we’re going to take on the newly released Outbreak mode which involves fighting the undead on a much larger scale than previous maps Die Maschine and Firebase Z. The new experience places squads of four in free-roam environments where they will take part in objective-based modes such as defend, escort, retrieve, eliminate, and holdout. Even though the maps are open to explore, players will still be able to extract or continue after each phase. Familiar staples such as the Crafting Table, support items, armor, and weapon upgrade machines, Pack-a-Punch, and Perk vending machines will all be present. Rewards for Outbreak include the new Refined and Flawless Aetherium Crystals, allowing players to upgrade skills to tier four and five. The previous cap was three. Zombies modes also typically involve secret areas, mysteries to solve, and Wonder Weapons. Over on Call Of Duty’s battle royale map, we still don’t know what is going to happen with the season pass listing Warzone’s event as “A dark wave approaches Verdansk.” Join us to find out.

Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and free-to-play Warzone are available for PS4 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Cold War Season 2 releases on February 25th.
