You can play the demo on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC--the only system that doesn't support the demo but will play the game at launch is Stadia.\n\nIn the video above, we do a side-by-side comparison of the Outriders demo, playing it both on PS4 and PS5. We take a look at how well the game performs on the two systems, both in terms of graphical quality and loading times.\n\nIn Outriders, you play as an Outrider, a specialized combat scout charged with leading humanity's exploration across a new world after the destruction of Earth. Mutated by a freakish storm upon your arrival, you become an Altered--someone who can bend the elements to their will. You have the choice of commanding earth, fire, time, or technology.\u00a0\n\nThe demo for Outriders covers the opening chapter, which includes several campaign missions and optional side quests. Your progress in the demo will transfer over to the full game once it launches on April 1. Like that version, the Outriders' demo supports co-op, allowing you to team up with other players in three-person squads.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jCxsNKOE20", "date_published": "2021-02-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl Reveal Trailer!", "description": "Check out the official reveal for Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl!

Here's how escort and high-value target objectives work.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are entering Season 2 with a new battle pass that focuses on zombies. Based on recent trailers, zombies are expected to invade both the Dirty Bomb maps and Warzone. Currently, in Warzone, the developers are building unanswered mysteries such as a dark ship approaching the shore, and an inactive Trail Computer from Zombies has been found.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to take on the newly released Outbreak mode which involves fighting the undead on a much larger scale than previous maps Die Maschine and Firebase Z. The new experience places squads of four in free-roam environments where they will take part in objective-based modes such as defend, escort, retrieve, eliminate, and holdout. Even though the maps are open to explore, players will still be able to extract or continue after each phase. Familiar staples such as the Crafting Table, support items, armor, and weapon upgrade machines, Pack-a-Punch, and Perk vending machines will all be present. Rewards for Outbreak include the new Refined and Flawless Aetherium Crystals, allowing players to upgrade skills to tier four and five. The previous cap was three. Zombies modes also typically involve secret areas, mysteries to solve, and Wonder Weapons. Over on Call Of Duty\u2019s battle royale map, we still don\u2019t know what is going to happen with the season pass listing Warzone\u2019s event as \u201cA dark wave approaches Verdansk.\u201d Join us to find out.\n\nCall Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and free-to-play Warzone are available for PS4 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
