\n\nFrance are actually going to do anything about the imminent growing problem of the \n\nUK Variant\n\nNow growing 60% week on week\n\nNow 14% of all cases.\n\nOnly 5 or 6% last week\n \nYet still they are avoiding lockdown as the country as usual is 50/50 split on it\n\nTr\u00e8s bonne soiree\n\n\nUS, Reducing new infections\n\nNatural infections + vaccinations \n\nPost-holiday surge is probably over\n\nReduced travel\n\nMillions of individual and family behaviours\n\nGatherings down\n\nMask wearing normalised\n\nMemorial Day in May\n\nAny gatherings will cause contagious variants to

the vaccinated\n\n(67% reduction in positive swabs among those vaccinated, Oxford AZ, one dose)\n\nApproximately 654,000 total deaths by May 1\n\nWithout transmission of B.1.351, deaths drop to 595,000 deaths by May 1\n\nResurgence, spring in some states, California and Florida\n\nKeeping mobility low and maintaining social distancing, 30,000 less deaths\n\nChristopher Murray, director of IHME\n\nGetting vaccines out quickly is essential, \n\nand masks are still one of the best tools we have to keep transmission low\n\nPeople will need to continue taking precautions even once they are vaccinated, \n\nFactors\n\nSome states are not re-imposing social distancing mandates even when daily death rates are high\n\nHerd immunity, unlikely to slow transmission in the coming months\n\nHigher levels of immunity are needed with a more contagious variant\n\nIHME\u2019s forecasts predict only 38% of people in the US will be immune by May 1.\n\nWorst-case scenario, third wave next winter\n\nGovernments and the public need to plan for the real prospect that COVID-19 must be managed on an ongoing basis\n\nIt\u2019s critical to vaccinate as many people as possible\n\nand to
