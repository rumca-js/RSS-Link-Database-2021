It was six years ago that the band The Last Revel first performed in our studio. Since that time, the Minneapolis-based "front porch Americana" band have undergone some lineup changes — and they even almost threw in the towel. But their most recent visit to our studio was in June 2019, and it was a jubilant session as The Last Revel played songs from their album, "Fool's Spring," which they recorded in Nashville.

Watch three songs from The Last Revel's June 2019 session.
