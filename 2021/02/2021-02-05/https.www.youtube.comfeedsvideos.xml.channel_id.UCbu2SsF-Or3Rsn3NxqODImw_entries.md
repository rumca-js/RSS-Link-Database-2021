Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the weaponry of Red Dead Redemption 2, including the iconic Colt Single Action revolver, the Winchester 1866 rifle, and the Browning Auto-5 shotgun.

Red Dead Redemption 2 saw Rockstar return to the frontiers of the Wild West for a prequel to the seminal Red Dead Redemption, and as a result, it includes a range of period weaponry from 1899 such as the Smith & Wesson Volcanic Pistol, the Remington Rolling Block Rifle, and the Norwegian 1894 Krag-Jørgensen rifle.

In the above video, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the guns of Red Dead Redemption 2 and compares them to their real-world counterparts..

Looking for a new wireless gaming mouse? Look no further, as we put the most high-end tech and peripherals up against the more budget-friendly options to see which device is most worth their price.

First we have the Razer Naga Pro, a modular wireless gaming mouse featuring three swappable side plates designed across different game genres, hyperspeed wireless technology, over 19 buttons, and a 20,000 DPI. All of this comes in at around $150 USD.
Secondly, on the more fiscally responsible side of these devices, we have the SteelSeries Rival 3 wireless, featuring a 400+ hour battery life, SteelSeries’ “pixel-perfect” TrueMove Air optical sensor, and an 18,000 DPI. This package is going to set you back a much more reasonable $50 USD.

But which of these fantastic mice are worth their price?

Skill-based matchmaking has become a huge problem in Call Of Duty so let’s explore if SBMM is as unfair as people think it is. 

A lot of Call Of Duty streamers are saying that skill-based matchmaking has been ruining their Warzone experience. Some of the issues are being grouped in with cheaters, sweaty matches, and unfair rounds. Players have also been thrown into bot lobbies with extremely low skilled players which isn’t fun for anyone. 

In this video, we talk about how players experience SBMM, why they feel the way they do, and why Activision probably won’t get rid of it. We also dive into what one expert, Josh Menke, who has worked on matchmaking in Halo and Call Of Duty, has said about fairness and player perception. We also get into how large skill gaps can drive players away from a game and the importance of good matchmaking. 

Call Of Duty: Warzone combines elements of Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold war which are available for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

Apex Legends had a transformative second year--four new characters, two new weapons, a third map, and more balancing adjustments than we can possibly list. But we can at least go over the big stuff.

In the video above, Jordan Ramée details Apex Legends' highs, lows, and biggest changes during the battle royale game's second year. That's everything major that occurred during Season 4: Assimilation, Season 5: Fortune's Favor, Season 6: Boosted, and Season 7: Ascension. 

During that time, Apex Legends saw the addition of playable characters Revenant, Loba, Rampart, and Horizon, as well as the Sentinel sniper rifle and the Volt submachine gun. How players both fought one another and managed their loot also changed as new items like Evo Shields, Mobile Respawn Beacons, and Replicators were added throughout the year.

It's a great time to jump back into Apex Legends as Season 8: Mayhem has begun. Season 8 kicks off Apex Legends' third year with a bang, adding playable character Fuse, the 30-30 Repeater, and quite a few welcome map changes to Kings Canyon.

## You Should Try Hitman With The Hud Off

Jean-Luc argues that Hitman can be a better experience if you disable some of its key HUD elements.

The joy of Hitman comes from a mastery of its levels. Learning their layouts, planning the perfect hit, or adapting to a changing situation. But what do you do once you’ve mastered Hitman? You make it harder for yourself.

In this video, Jean-Luc Seipke talks about how the experience of playing Hitman 3 can significantly change when you disable key HUD features such as Mission Story Guidance and Instincts Mode. Both are great tools for helping out players but Jean-Luc argues that without them you’re forced to act more cautiously and creatively, creating a more thrilling Hitman experience. And of course just for fun he also tries the game without any HUD just to see what it’s like.
