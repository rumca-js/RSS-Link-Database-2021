Cases down 70% since New Year peak 

February 5, 2021

Daily average UK symptomatic cases, + 20,360

Based on swab tests data from up to five days ago

Around one million weekly reporters

The proportion of newly symptomatic users who have positive swab tests

Data from 15,286 recent swab tests done between 17 to 31 January 2021.

Week before, + 28,645

Down 29%. 

Peak of 1st January, + 69,000

Down 70%

UK Prevalence

One in 170 people in the UK currently symptomatic
(ONS, W/E 30th January, 1 in 65)


Dorset, Bournemouth, Christchurch, Poole, 1 in 100

London, 1 in 102

Liverpool City Region, 1 in 122 

The UK R value is 0.9

England, 0.9, Wales, 0.9, Scotland, 0.9 

East Midlands, R = 1.0

Cases are coming down in all age groups


France (Anthony)

Just a short note today, awaiting this week’s government pow wow announcement as to whether 

France are actually going to do anything about the imminent growing problem of the 

UK Variant

Now growing 60% week on week

Now 14% of all cases.

Only 5 or 6% last week
 
Yet still they are avoiding lockdown as the country as usual is 50/50 split on it

Très bonne soiree


US, Reducing new infections

Natural infections + vaccinations 

Post-holiday surge is probably over

Reduced travel

Millions of individual and family behaviours

Gatherings down

Mask wearing normalised

Memorial Day in May

Any gatherings will cause contagious variants to spread

VOC driven increase in cases, April 

Herd immunity coming, but not yet

US, CDC data

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases

Past 7 days

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=sf_coronavirus

New daily reported cases, down 18.8%

New daily reported deaths, up 0.3%

CoViD related hospitalizations, down 14.1% (86,373)

Test positivity rate, 7.4%

Vaccine doses since 14th December, 38,326,000

Two doses, 8,020,000 (2.46%)

UK data

New COVID-19 forecasts show the possibility of a spring spike in deaths if variants spread widely, people let down their guard

Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation

University of Washington

Forecasts include vaccine distribution and the presence of the B.1.1.7

IF widespread transmission of the B.1.351 (South Africa VOC)

IF Mobility returning to pre-pandemic levels in the vaccinated

(67% reduction in positive swabs among those vaccinated, Oxford AZ, one dose)

Approximately 654,000 total deaths by May 1

Without transmission of B.1.351, deaths drop to 595,000 deaths by May 1

Resurgence, spring in some states, California and Florida

Keeping mobility low and maintaining social distancing, 30,000 less deaths

Christopher Murray, director of IHME

Getting vaccines out quickly is essential, 

and masks are still one of the best tools we have to keep transmission low

People will need to continue taking precautions even once they are vaccinated, 

Factors

Some states are not re-imposing social distancing mandates even when daily death rates are high

Herd immunity, unlikely to slow transmission in the coming months

Higher levels of immunity are needed with a more contagious variant

IHME’s forecasts predict only 38% of people in the US will be immune by May 1.

Worst-case scenario, third wave next winter

Governments and the public need to plan for the real prospect that COVID-19 must be managed on an ongoing basis

It’s critical to vaccinate as many people as possible

and to prepare for long-term behaviour change

Sputnik V (Gam-Covid-Vac)

 2 doses, 3 weeks apart

Muscle injection

Freezer storage

Developing an alternative formulation that can be refrigerated

Gamaleya Research Institute (Ministry of Health)

Combination of two adenoviruses called Ad5 and Ad26

August 11th President Putin announced approval

Before phase 3 trials had started

November, Russian government began offering Sputnik V within Russia

Widespread hesitancy

Phase 3, Russia, Belarus, UAE, Venezuela, India

Gamaleya Institute joined forces in December with the AstraZeneca

AstraZeneca / Gamaleya combination started Phase 1 trial on Dec. 24


Safety and efficacy of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine: an interim analysis of a randomised controlled phase 3 trial in Russia 

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00234-8/fulltext

Background

A heterologous recombinant adenovirus

Phase 2 results,

showed a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses

Interim analysis of this phase 3 trial 
Methods

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial

25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow

Participants at least 18 years, with negative PCR and IgG and IgM tests

Randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo

Two shots, 21 days apart

First dose, rAd26

Second dose, rAd5),

Both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S

Outcome recorded 21 days after second shot (vaccine or placebo)

Finding

Sept 7 to Nov 24, 2020

N = 21 977

Randomly assigned

Vaccine group, n = 16 501

Placebo group, n = 5476

N = 19 866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included

(2,144 participants older than 60 years, 1,611 in the vaccine group and 533 in the placebo group)

Primary outcome analysis

Included all participants who had received at least two doses at the time of database lock

Vaccine group, n = 14,964

16 (0·1%) confirmed COVID infections

No cases of moderate or severe COVID-19 confirmed at least 21 days after dose 1

Placebo group, n = 4,902

62 (1·3%) confirmed COVID infections

20 cases of moderate or severe COVID-19 confirmed at least 21 days after dose 1

Efficacy

91·6%

Vaccine efficacy was 91·8 in participants older than 60 years

Interim immunogenicity 

Vaccine group

RBD-specific IgG detected in 336 (98%) of 342 samples

Seroconversion rate of 98·25%

Higher levels of interferon-gamma

(secreted by activated T helper lymphocytes, T cytotoxic lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and NKs)

Significantly higher levels of IFN-γ secretion upon antigen restimulation

Placebo group

RBD-specific IgG was detected in 17 (15%) of 114 samples

Seroconversion rate of 14·91%

(p less than 0·0001 vs the vaccine group)

Adverse events

Grade 1

7485 [94·0%] of 7966 total events

Serous adverse events

Vaccine group


45 (0·3%) of 16, 427

Placebo group

23 (0·4%) of 5435

None were considered associated with vaccination

Four deaths were reported during the study

Vaccine group

Three (less than 0·1%) of 16 427

Placebo group

One (less than 0·1%) of 5435

None of which were considered related to the vaccine

Interpretation

This interim analysis of the phase 3 trial of Gam-COVID-Vac showed 91·6% efficacy against COVID-19 and was well tolerated in a large cohort
