We go through the entire Guilty Gear Strive Beta roster and perform a flashy combo with every single character.

Guilty Gear Strive Beta released for the public February 18th, giving players the chance to try out the famed fighting game before its release on April 6th, 2021. Notable characters such as Ky, Sol, May, and more make a return in Guilty Gear Strive.

We perform a multitude of combos, one for each character in the initial Guilty Gear Strive Beta roster. Using Roman Cancels, Overdrives, and interesting combo strings we push the combo system as far as we can. Our personal favorite's are Axl's and Ky's combo.

We have more on our site including the premiere of Ky Kikse's Dragon Install and a showcase of all the Overdrives in the Guilty Gear Strive Beta.

Watch Dogs: Legion Online has free roam, co-op, and endgame activities--here’s what you should be aware of before playing with friends. 

Watch Dogs: Legion Online brings a multiplayer component to Ubisoft's most recent open-world action-adventure game. In the online mode, players can recruit new characters, take on daily and weekly challenges, level their seasonal ranking, find collectibles such as new masks, and generally cause mayhem with friends. 

In this video, we talk about our hands-on experience playing free roam, solo and co-op missions, world events, and endgame activities. We talk over which activities are best for casual players versus coordinated teams that will need to be on mic and able to tackle complex mechanics. We also cover some of the difficulty challenges solo players might face with activities requiring simultaneous actions or fail states that kick players back several checkpoints. 

Watch Dogs: Legion is the third game in the series and is available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Google Stadia, and PC.

In celebration of Zelda's 35th anniversary we thought now would be a good time to look back at some of the best trailers and commercials from Zelda's history.

Zelda is officially 35 years old, dating back to the original Legend of Zelda’s launch on February 21, 1986. When a series has been around for that long there’s bound to be different advertising styles. From rap commercials in the 80’s to found footage ripoffs in the 2000’s there are a lot of approaches the Zelda series took when advertising over the decades.

In this video we’ve selected the best of them all, and at least 1 from each mainline game. This includes trailers and commercials, and those aren’t limited to just US or Japan. Some are comedic, some are epic, and some are just downright memorable.

In terms of what Nintendo is doing for the 35th anniversary of Zelda, it recently revealed that Skyward Sword HD will be making its way to the Switch 10 years after its original Wii release. It also revealed that more information about Breath of the Wild’s sequel will be revealed later this year.
