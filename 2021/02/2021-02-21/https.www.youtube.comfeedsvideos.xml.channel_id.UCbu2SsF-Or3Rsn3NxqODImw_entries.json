Notable characters such as Ky, Sol, May, and more make a return in Guilty Gear Strive.\n\nWe perform a multitude of combos, one for each character in the initial Guilty Gear Strive Beta roster. Using Roman Cancels, Overdrives, and interesting combo strings we push the combo system as far as we can. Our personal favorite's are Axl's and Ky's combo.\n\nWe have more on our site including the premiere of Ky Kikse's Dragon Install and a showcase of all the Overdrives in the Guilty Gear Strive Beta.\n\nTimestamps\n0:00 - Chipp Zanuff\n0:16 - Axl Low\n0:29 - May\n0:42 - Potemkin\n1:01 - Millia Rage\n1:16 - Zato-1\n1:28 - Ky Kikse\n1:42 - Sol Badguy\n1:58 - Faust\n2:14 - Ramlethal Valentine\n2:28 - Leo Whitefang\n2:43 - Giovanna\n2:57 - Nagoriyuki", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmmynGWgZEg", "date_published": "2021-02-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "OUTBREAK Trailer | Season Two | Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War & Warzone", "description": "Check out the all new OUTBREAK Trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War  & Warzone!

In the online mode, players can recruit new characters, take on daily and weekly challenges, level their seasonal ranking, find collectibles such as new masks, and generally cause mayhem with friends.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we talk about our hands-on experience playing free roam, solo and co-op missions, world events, and endgame activities. We talk over which activities are best for casual players versus coordinated teams that will need to be on mic and able to tackle complex mechanics. We also cover some of the difficulty challenges solo players might face with activities requiring simultaneous actions or fail states that kick players back several checkpoints.\u00a0\n\nWatch Dogs: Legion is the third game in the series and is available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Google Stadia, and PC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um4GFiKSjro", "date_published": "2021-02-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Best Zelda Commercials & Trailers (1986 - 2021)", "description": "In celebration of Zelda's 35th anniversary we thought now would be a good time to look back at some of the best trailers and commercials from Zelda's history.\n\nZelda is officially 35 years old, dating back to the original Legend of Zelda\u2019s launch on February 21, 1986. When a series has been around for that long there\u2019s bound to be different advertising styles. From rap commercials in the 80\u2019s to found footage ripoffs in the 2000\u2019s there are a lot of approaches the Zelda series took when advertising over the decades.\n\nIn this video we\u2019ve selected the best of them all, and at least 1 from each mainline game. This includes trailers and commercials, and those aren\u2019t limited to just US or Japan. Some are comedic, some are epic, and some are just downright memorable.\n\nIn terms of what Nintendo is doing for the 35th anniversary of Zelda, it recently revealed that Skyward Sword HD will be making its way to the Switch 10 years after its original Wii release. It also revealed that more information about Breath of the Wild\u2019s sequel will be revealed later this year.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:13 - The Legend of Zelda\n01:13 - Zelda II: The Adventure of Link\n01:43 - A Link to the Past\n02:53 - Link's Awakening\n03:54 - Ocarina of Time\n05:29 - Majora's Mask\n07:47 - Oracle of Seasons/Ages\n08:17 - Four Swords\n08:47 - The Wind Waker\n09:47 - Four Swords Adventures\n10:17 - The Minish Cap\n10:47 - Twilight Princess\n11:45 - Phantom Hourglass\n12:00 - Spirit Tracks\n12:57 - Skyward Sword\n14:13 - A Link Between Worlds\n14:44 - Tri Force Heroes\n15:24 - Breath of the Wild\n19:09 - Breath of the Wild Sequel\n20:28 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfv_bLvq-c", "date_published": "2021-02-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Rainbow Six's New Operator Flores Has An Explosive Drone", "description": "Flores is the latest operator to join Team Rainbow.
