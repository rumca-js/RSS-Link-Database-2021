Let me know in the comments what you think would happen if Smaug the Terrible survived later into the Third Age!\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings!  \n\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\u200b\n\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
