BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine in a Nationwide Mass Vaccination Setting

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765?query=featured_home

METHOD

Vaccinations, December 20, 2020, to February 1, 2021

Matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio

According to demographic and clinical characteristics

N = 596,618 (in each group)

DOCUMENTED INFECTIONS, 10,561 

Symptomatic infections, 5,996 (57%)

Requiring hospitalisation, 369

Severe cases of Covid-19, 229

Deaths, 41

RESULTS

Vaccine effectiveness at days 14 through 20 after the first dose

Vaccine effectiveness at 7 or more days after the second dose

Documented infection

46% and 92%

Symptomatic Covid-19

57% and 94% 

Hospitalization 

74% and 87% 

Last hospitalisation in the vaccinated group at 32 days

Severe disease

62% and 92% 

Last severe case in the vaccinated group at 30 days


Effectiveness in preventing death

72% for days 14 through 20 after the first dose 

Deaths after 44 days

Vaccinated group, 9 

Unvaccinated group, 32 

Last death in the vaccinated group at 30 days

CONCLUSIONS

Consistent with a gradual daily increase in vaccine effectiveness

This study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective for a wide range of Covid-19â€“related outcomes, a finding consistent with that of the randomized trial.
