This week on The Escapist Show, Nick and Jack interview Jörg Friedrich, the former Lead Level Designer on Spec Ops: The Line. With the recent re-announcement of Six Days in Fallujah, we wanted to talk to Jörg about how a game like Spec Ops would be received if it was announced today, the hastiness of the controversy around Six Days and the challenges of making games about war.
