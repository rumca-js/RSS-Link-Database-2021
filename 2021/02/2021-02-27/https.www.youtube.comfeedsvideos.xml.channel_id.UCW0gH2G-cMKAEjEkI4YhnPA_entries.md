"They will help one another!" With Gandalf's warning of a Smaug-Sauron alliance as a starting point, and using my usual weekly level of research, I've created a plausible scenario that sees Smaug survive, how Sauron could persuade the dragon to help, and the massive destruction that would result.  There's some solid leads Tolkien gives us, as well as some guesses of my own. Let me know in the comments what you think would happen if Smaug the Terrible survived later into the Third Age!
