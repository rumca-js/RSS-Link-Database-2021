Directed by Chaplin, it was the fifth and last film made at Essanay's Niles, California studio. The Tramp marked the beginning of The Tramp character most known today, even though Chaplin played the character in earlier films. This film marked the first departure from his more slapstick character in the earlier films, with a sad ending and showing he cared for others, rather than just himself. The film co-stars Edna Purviance as the farmer's daughter and Ernest Van Pelt as Edna's father. The outdoor scenes were filmed on location near Niles.\n\nWikipedia:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tramp_(film%29\n\nIMDB:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006177/\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
