The original Macintosh released in 1984 changed the world. It was the first computer to bring a GUI, mouse, and windowing system to the mass market. Sure, machines from Xerox and others existed beforeâ€”in classic Apple fashion, nothing they created was novel. But it was polished, it was targeted at "normal people" rather than tech enthusiasts that had previously dominated the home computer sales market and it was designed "right." It wasn't resorted to the basement dweller's lair, rather at the centerpiece of the home. As one might expect, accessories for the device became very numerous and in 1984, the MacTable was released. Partial drawing table, partial computer desk, partial... well, who knows what the heck it was for? Designed by famous industrial designer Jacob Jensen of Bang & Olufsen fame, it isn't just your average desk. Let's take a look at it in 2021. #Macintosh #RetroTech #IndustrialDesign
