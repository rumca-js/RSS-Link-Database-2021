Oxford University extends COVID-19 vaccine study to children

Safety and immune responses in children and young adults

Ages, 6 to 17 years

Single-blind, randomised phase II trial

N =  300 volunteers

Vaccine group, n = 240

Control group, n = 60, meningitis vaccine

Safe and gives a sore arm

Andrew Pollard

Professor of Paediatric Infection and Immunity, and Chief Investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial

While most children are relatively unaffected by coronavirus and are unlikely to become unwell with the infection, 

it is important to establish the safety and immune response to the vaccine in children and young people as some children may benefit from vaccination. 

These new trials will extend our understanding of control of SARS-CoV2 to younger age groups

Starting trials for younger children this spring

Pfizer

Moderna

Janssen

Effect of calcifediol treatment and best available therapy versus best available therapy on intensive care unit admission and mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19: A pilot randomized clinical study (October 2020)

50 patients treated with calcifediol

One required admission to ICU (2%)

Randomly assigned

Calcifediol treatment group n = 551

Day one, 532 ug (21,000 iu)

Days, 3, 7, 15, 30, 266 ug (10,640 iu)

No adverse effects reported

Required ICU, 30 (5.4%) 

Deaths, 36 (6.5%)

Death RR = 0.36

64% reduced chance of death

Control group n = 379

Required ICU, 80 (21.1%), p less than 0.0001

Deaths, 57 (15%), p = 0.001

Interpretation

In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, calcifediol treatment at the time of hospitalization significantly reduced ICU admission and mortality.

Early calcifediol after admission

Prior to ARDS development, is critical for mortality reduction

Initiation of calcifediol during ICU admission did not modify patient survival
