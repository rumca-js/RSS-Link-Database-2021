Two years ago this week, the Cactus Blossoms visited The Current studio to play songs from their then-forthcoming record, "Easy Way." The band certainly didn't take the easy way when making the album. "This time around, we produced it ourselves and went down that rabbit hole," the Cactus Blossoms' Jack Torrey told Bill DeVille. "Now that it's done; we're really glad. It took us a while to make it."

Watch two songs from "Easy Way" — and as an added bonus, enjoy "Powder Blue" from the Cactus Blossoms' studio session from February 2016.
