When a series has been around for that long there\u2019s bound to be different advertising styles. From rap commercials in the 80\u2019s to found footage ripoffs in the 2000\u2019s there are a lot of approaches the Zelda series took when advertising over the decades.\n\nIn this video we\u2019ve selected the best of them all, and at least 1 from each mainline game. This includes trailers and commercials, and those aren\u2019t limited to just US or Japan. Some are comedic, some are epic, and some are just downright memorable.\n\nIn terms of what Nintendo is doing for the 35th anniversary of Zelda, it recently revealed that Skyward Sword HD will be making its way to the Switch 10 years after its original Wii release. It also revealed that more information about Breath of the Wild\u2019s sequel will be revealed later this year.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:13 - The Legend of Zelda\n01:13 - Zelda II: The Adventure of Link\n01:43 - A Link to the Past\n02:53 - Link's Awakening\n03:54 - Ocarina of Time\n05:29 - Majora's Mask\n07:47 - Oracle of Seasons/Ages\n08:17 - Four Swords\n08:47 - The Wind Waker\n09:47 - Four Swords Adventures\n10:17 - The Minish Cap\n10:47 - Twilight Princess\n11:45 - Phantom Hourglass\n12:00 - Spirit Tracks\n12:57 - Skyward Sword\n14:13 - A Link Between Worlds\n14:44 - Tri Force Heroes\n15:24 - Breath of the Wild\n19:09 - Breath of the Wild Sequel\n20:28 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfv_bLvq-c", "date_published": "2021-02-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Rainbow Six's New Operator Flores Has An Explosive Drone", "description": "Flores is the latest operator to join Team Rainbow.
