Four years ago this week, The Current got a great treat when Craig Finn visited our studio to perform some songs from his then-forthcoming solo record, "We All Want the Same Things."

Finn is originally from Minnesota, and he is known for songs that contain plenty of geographical and cultural references to the North Star State, but Finn has made New York his home for more than a decade. "I like a lot of alone time," he said. "I can think better if I'm surrounded by chaos but I'm not having to deal with anyone. It also makes New York City a really good place to live."

That said, returning to Minnesota is always nourishing for Finn, particularly when he gets to play at in the First Avenue Mainroom. "You know it's a sure thing — it's going to be great," Finn says. "First Avenue … is my favorite place to play in the world."

This week, Mary Lucia talks about a new documentary, 'Rock Camp: The Movie,' that's streaming now. 'Rock Camp' has a look at the series of events created by David Fishof to give everyday people a chance to jam with their music heroes. "It just features a lot of regular people who just want to rock," Mary says, "and it's dentists and chiropractors and accountants and mothers and people that didn't aspire maybe to have music as a career, but would take an opportunity to play with Paul Stanley seriously."
