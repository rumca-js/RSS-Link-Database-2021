Coming from Velan Studios, the game is a tactical team-based arena brawler that takes the concept of dodgeball and amps it up by several degrees. Described as a \"dodge-brawler\" by the developers, Knockout City puts you in the role of a newcomer to the big city who joins a gang and has to defend their new territory from rivals looking to take over. These engagements take place on several dodgeball arenas across the city, set in construction sites, rooftops of skyscrapers, and even on the busy streets of downtown.\n\nWe had the chance to get some hands-on time with Knockout City's upcoming closed beta, which will occur on February 20th through the 21st. In the beta, players will be able to customize their \"dodge-brawler\" and join other crew members to face off against rivals in the Team KO match type, which is Knockout City's take on the classic 3v3 team deathmatch mode. In this gameplay video, you can see all the different types of moves, team cross-ups, and tricks you can pull on your enemies to score a hit. \n\nComing to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch on May 21st, Knockout City is shaping up to be a fun and accessible take on classic multiplayer combat. We'll have more on Knockout City coming up as we approach its launch in the months ahead.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hckauYFPYQ", "date_published": "2021-02-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mario Golf Super Rush | Nintendo Direct", "description": "A little birdie told us Mario Golf is coming to Nintendo Switch for a brand new tournament!

Blending strategic deck-building with class-based action-RPG combat, Magic: Legends incorporates the many tenets of high-fantasy action into a new game coming from developers Cryptic Studios and Perfect Worlds.\n\nJust ahead of its open beta launching on March 23 for PC, the developers offered insight into the different approach Magic: Legends' takes to collecting loot, and how it aims to make the grind stress-free for players. In this video, Cryptic Studios design lead Adam Hetenyi explains how the new gear system came to be. Following the round of alpha tests, the developers responded to fan feedback and incorporated a new loot and gear system to complement the existing deck-building and action-RPG combat.\n\n\"Through our closed alpha test in 2020, we gathered a lot of player feedback that [noted] while our spell and artifact systems were an interesting approach to player progression in the Magic multiverse, these features couldn't fully replace a gear system in an action-RPG,\" stated Hetenyi. \"So we took another pass at our itemization to develop a gear system that makes defeating enemies and completing missions that much more rewarding, without avoiding overbearing loot drops and inventory management.\"\n\nBefore this update, Magic: Legends leaned heavily into its suite of cards that added new skills and modified the abilities for each class, along with a set of relics that added buffs and changes as well. The inclusion of a new gear system adds in a layer of customization and refinement for each of these playable characters. In addition to the deck-building system, you can now add six different gear types to your character, which amplifies their stats, skills, and attributes. While the loot doesn't flow as common as in other action-RPG games, Magic: Legends players will be able to acquire these pieces of loot from completing quests or by slaying elite foes tied to key missions.\n\nFor more on Magic: Legends, be sure to check back with GameSpot for more updates.
