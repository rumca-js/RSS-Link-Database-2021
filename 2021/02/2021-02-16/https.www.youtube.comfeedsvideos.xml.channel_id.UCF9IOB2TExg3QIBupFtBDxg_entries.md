December 14, 2020, to February 7, 2021

Over 41 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines administered in the United States

VAERS received 1,170 reports of death (0.003%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine 

CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified

CDC requests medical records to further assess reports

A review of available clinical information

Death certificates

Autopsy reports

Medical records

Revealed no link with vaccination

CDC and FDA will continue to investigate reports of adverse events, including deaths, reported to VAERS.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html

COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.

Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines, and these vaccines will undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.

CDC recommends you get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you are eligible.

CDC, FDA, and other federal partners will continue to monitor the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines

Coronavirus vaccine â€“ weekly summary of yellow card reporting

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#analysis-of-data

Vaccination is the single most effective way to reduce deaths and severe illness from COVID-19.
 
The number and nature of suspected adverse reactions reported so far are not unusual in comparison to other types of routinely used vaccines

The overall safety experience with both vaccines is so far as expected from the clinical trials

Based on current experience, the expected benefits of both COVID-19 vaccines in preventing COVID-19 and its serious complications far outweigh any known side effects

As with all vaccines and medicines, the safety of COVID-19 vaccines is being continuously monitored

Events with a fatal outcome

Based on age-stratified all-cause mortality in England and Wales

Several thousand deaths are expected to have occurred, 

naturally, 

within 7 days

of the many millions of doses of vaccines administered so far
