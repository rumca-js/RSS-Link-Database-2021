Libre Office 7.1 was released, and it comes with a lot of interesting changes. The biggest one, in my opinion, is a first run dialog that will let users pick the interface they want to use.

If you have tons of games and you'd like to ensure that your saved games are safe, there is now a new tool called Ludusavi, or Ludusavi, however you decide to pronounce it.

WIne 6.2 was released. This new version brings an updated mono engine, up to version 6.0, with directX support, and support has been added to NTDLL debugger APIs. On Mac OS, the Xbox controller should also behave better. 51 bugs have been fixed in that release, including for Earth 2160, Shadow Warrior 2, Inside, Multiple Adobe Creative Cloud products, Serious Sam, Hitman Absolution or World of Tanks.

But not yet, it seems, as Proton 5.13-6, still based on Wine 5.13, has been released. It embarks fixes from Proton Experimental, including for Cyberpunk 2077, Yakuza Like a Dragon, Subnautica, or Doom 2016. It seems like Nioh 2 is now playable, and No Man's Sky should now support VR back again. Players of Deep ROck Galactic will have their voice chat back, and PS 5 controllers are now better supported.
