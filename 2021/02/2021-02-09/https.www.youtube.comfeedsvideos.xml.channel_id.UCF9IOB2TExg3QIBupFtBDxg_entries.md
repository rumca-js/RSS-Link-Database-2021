Coordinated by Chinese officials

Mission to Wuhan, inconclusive

Chinese-WHO team

Coronavirus, most likely jumped from bats to an intermediary species

Virus could have been spreading around the world before it erupted in Wuhan in December 2019

WHO team reiterated that it is possible the virus was carried by frozen food

Emphatically ruled out a lab mishap, after talking to Wuhan lab

China's Global Times

Finally put an American conspiracy theory to rest

WHO visit showcased China's positive, scientific, cooperative attitude

Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control

Other locations in the world, particularly U.S. labs, must be investigated next

historically the United States … launched biological and chemical warfare

A WHO is now expected to move on to Southeast Asia, to explain origins

Peter Daszak, WHO delegation member

EcoHealth Alliance, coordinated U.S. grant funding to the WIV

Richard Ebright, microbiologist (Rutgers University)

Apparent conflict of interest

moved quickly to make available all its databases of genetic sequences and strains

provided lab notes, 

records and private interviews with research, 

waste removal and janitorial staff

None of that happened or was even requested

Resurgence of COVID-19 in Manaus, Brazil, despite high seroprevalence

European and Asian countries

Second wave, consistent with many remaining susceptible

Manaus, Brazil

Blood donors, 76% had been infected by October 2020

Also, estimated attack rates in Amazon Basin, 70% 

Estimated SARS-CoV-2 attack rate in Manaus, above theoretical herd immunity threshold of 67%

(based on a reproduction number of 3)

But January 2021

Manaus hospital admissions, 3,431

(552 in Dec 1–19, 2020)

May to November, relaxation of control measures, low admissions for 7 months

There are at least four non-mutually exclusive possible explanations for the resurgence of COVID-19 in Manaus. 

Why a resurgence of cases?

First factor, first wave overestimated

Attack rate could have been overestimated during the first wave

June, seroprevalence, 52·5%

Second factor, waning immunity

Waning of IgG antibody titres observed in blood donors 

Most of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in Manaus occurred 7–8 months before resurgence in January, 2021

(No observed behaviour change in Manaus, reduced population mobility)

If resurgence in Manaus is due to waning, similar resurgence everywhere



Third factor, antigenic escape

New SARS-CoV-2 lineages

Circulating in Brazil, B.1.1.7 and P.1

P.1 detected in Manaus on Jan 12, 2021

P.1 lineage, accrued ten unique spike protein mutations,

Including E484K 

P.2 lineage also detected Manaus

P.2 independently accrued the spike E484K mutation

In-vitro evidence that E484K mutation reduces neutralisation by polyclonal antibodies in convalescent sera

Antigenic escape

Fourth factor, increased transmissibility

SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the second wave might have higher inherent transmissibility

Eg. Relative prevalence of P.1 lineage, up to 42% by  December, 2020

P.1 lineage

Shares several independently acquired mutations

B.1.1.7 (N501)

B.1.325 (K417N/T, E484K, N501Y)

Conclusions

Variants need to be quickly investigated

Genetic, immunological, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics

Serological and genomic surveillance in Manaus is a priority

Determining vaccine is also crucial
Rapid sharing of lineage-specific frequencies underlying reinfection
