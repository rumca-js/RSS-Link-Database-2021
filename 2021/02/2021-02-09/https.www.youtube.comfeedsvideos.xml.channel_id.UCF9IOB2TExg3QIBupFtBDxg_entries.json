Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo,\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases and Parasitises and Institute of Tropical Medicine of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, \n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00183-5/fulltext\n\nEuropean and Asian countries\n\nSecond wave, consistent with many remaining susceptible\n\nManaus, Brazil\n\nBlood donors, 76% had been infected by October 2020\n\nAlso, estimated attack rates in Amazon Basin, 70% \n\nEstimated SARS-CoV-2 attack rate in Manaus, above theoretical herd immunity threshold of 67%\n\n(based on a reproduction number of 3)\n\nBut January 2021\n\nManaus hospital admissions, 3,431\n\n(552 in Dec 1\u201319, 2020)\n\nMay to November, relaxation of control measures, low admissions for 7 months\n\nThere are at least four non-mutually exclusive possible explanations for the resurgence of COVID-19 in Manaus. \n\nWhy a resurgence of cases?\n\nFirst factor, first wave overestimated\n\nAttack rate could have been overestimated during the first wave\n\nJune, seroprevalence, 52\u00b75%\n\nSecond factor, waning immunity\n\nWaning of IgG antibody titres observed in blood donors \n\nMost of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in Manaus occurred 7\u20138 months before resurgence in January, 2021\n\n(No observed behaviour change in Manaus, reduced population mobility)\n\nIf resurgence in Manaus is due to waning, similar resurgence everywhere\n\n\n\nThird factor, antigenic escape\n\nNew SARS-CoV-2 lineages\n\nCirculating in Brazil, B.1.1.7 and P.1\n\nP.1 detected in Manaus on Jan 12, 2021\n\nP.1 lineage, accrued ten unique spike protein mutations,\n\nIncluding E484K \n\nP.2 lineage also detected Manaus\n\nP.2 independently accrued the spike E484K mutation\n\nIn-vitro evidence that E484K mutation reduces neutralisation by polyclonal antibodies in convalescent sera\n\nAntigenic escape\n\nFourth factor, increased transmissibility\n\nSARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the second wave might have higher inherent transmissibility\n\nEg. Relative prevalence of P.1 lineage, up to 42% by  December, 2020\n\nP.1 lineage\n\nShares several independently acquired mutations\n\nB.1.1.7 (N501)\n\nB.1.325 (K417N/T, E484K, N501Y)\n\nConclusions\n\nVariants need to be quickly investigated\n\nGenetic, immunological, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics\n\nSerological and genomic surveillance in Manaus is a priority\n\nDetermining vaccine is also crucial\nRapid sharing of lineage-specific frequencies underlying reinfection", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnnLZAMH_ho", "date_published": "2021-02-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
