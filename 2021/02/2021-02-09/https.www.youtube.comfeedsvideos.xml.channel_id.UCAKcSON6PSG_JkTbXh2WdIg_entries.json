It's simply called \"Marley,\" and it is so amazing. It's beautiful. It's sad. But it's such an interesting look at somebody who was so much more than just a musician or the most famous musician to come from Jamaica.\n\nOf course, the music is incredible. Marley was a poet. He was just one of those guys whom everyone describes as he just did everything 100 percent. \n\nBob Marley \u2014 whose birthdate is February 6 \u2014 is such an icon, loved around the world, and this film was made with the support of the Marley family. It's directed by Kevin Macdonald, whose other films include \"The Last King of Scotland\" and \"Whitney.\"\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#bobmarley #marylucia #marleyfilm", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zWI93WM-0k", "date_published": "2021-02-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
