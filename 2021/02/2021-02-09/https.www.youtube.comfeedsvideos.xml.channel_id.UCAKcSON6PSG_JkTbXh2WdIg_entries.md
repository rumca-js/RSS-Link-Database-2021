There was a documentary made about Bob Marley a few years ago that's now available on Showtime, Hulu, Amazon Prime and YouTube to rent. It's simply called "Marley," and it is so amazing. It's beautiful. It's sad. But it's such an interesting look at somebody who was so much more than just a musician or the most famous musician to come from Jamaica.

Of course, the music is incredible. Marley was a poet. He was just one of those guys whom everyone describes as he just did everything 100 percent. 

Bob Marley — whose birthdate is February 6 — is such an icon, loved around the world, and this film was made with the support of the Marley family. It's directed by Kevin Macdonald, whose other films include "The Last King of Scotland" and "Whitney."
