So he launched a new subreddit, one called \u201cWallStreetBets\u201d\n\nA new startup was founded in Silicon Valley: a baby named Robinhood. At first, it was just an app that allowed you to track stocks, no buying or selling.\n\nGameStop (GME) releases a poor earnings report, cancels dividend payments to people who own the stock, analysts downgrade the stock\n\nMicheal Burry, the investor that shorted the housing bubble and was portrayed by Steve Carell in The Big Short, announces that he owns 3% of GameStop. Micheal Burry and Reddit user DFV, started this whole trend based on fundamental analysis\n\nRobinhood launches a new feature that lets you buy fractional shares.\n\nGameStop $GME hits a low of $2.57.\n\nThe billionaire founder of the successful pet ecommerce company, Chewy.com, buys a 9% stake in GameStop.\n\nA member of Wall Street Bets writes a stock analysis on why GameStop could be a winner. GameStop was the most shorted stock on the stock market at the time: with around 120% of their stocks shorted\nSince so many people were shorting GME stock, this Reddit user theorized that once the market realizes that Gamestop is not all that bad and more good news comes out, the price will rise, forcing the short sellers to exit their positions, which will drive the price higher, which will cause a short squeeze\n\nRyan Cohen and GameStop reach an agreement on the board of directors. Because they have so much experience in eCommerce, Ryan Cohen is viewed as the savior of GameStop.\n\nInstitutional investors and hedge funds that thought GameStop was for sure going to perish, shorting the stock, pushing it downward\nAnd there were up against the degenerates on Wall Street Bets buying the stock and buying call options for the stock - pushing it upward\n\nOther meme stocks roar like AMC stock. The Reddit traders recruit some unlikely allies: quant funds and other hedge funds that saw an opportunity to get on the right side of the battle\n\nMelvin Capital gets bailed out. \n\n-----------------------\nTesk, No Spirit, Sitting Duck - Driftaway https://chll.to/db8f6020 \nNo Spirit - Something Warm https://chll.to/88148ea2 \n\nThis video is in partnership with Stereo.\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
