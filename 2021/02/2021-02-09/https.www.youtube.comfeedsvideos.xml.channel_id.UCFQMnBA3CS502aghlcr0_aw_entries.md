My idea for this interview was a post-mortem on GameStop. It was many people's first exposure to the market, and a rare moment of retail traders winning BIG. But it also could be a good catalyst for learning risk management, fundamentals and more basic finance principles. Today my guest is Patrick Boyle. 
Patrick Boyle is a fund manager, academic, and author. Boyle is the Founder of Palomar Capital Management, a UK-based hedge fund.

this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.
