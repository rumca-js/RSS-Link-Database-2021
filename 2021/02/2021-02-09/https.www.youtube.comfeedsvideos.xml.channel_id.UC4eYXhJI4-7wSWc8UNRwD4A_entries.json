Shot in vivid black and white, the concert includes songs from throughout her career framed by her thoughts on the importance and influence of James Baldwin: \"He deserves flowers every day. Most of all because he was willing to discuss things that were painful, hard to look at, hard to see, hard to accept.\"\n\nThat description also applies to Ndegeocello's inventive and challenging work on display here. She opens with \"Step Into the Projects\" from her 1993 debut album, Plantation Lullabies, transformed from its original funky groove into a stark spoken word piece. \"Price of the Ticket,\" with her longtime guitarist Chris Bruce, is from Ndegeocello's recent project, Chapter & Verse: The Gospel of James Baldwin, \"a 21st century ritual toolkit for justice\" inspired by Baldwin's The Fire Next Time.\n\nShe moves next from these songs about communal life to two that dig into internal turmoil. \"Forget My Name\" from Comet Come To Me (2014) is stripped down from its original reggae arrangement and lays bare the haunting imagery in the lyrics. \"Fool of Me,\" from her acclaimed album Bitter (1999), ends the set with just vocals and guitar. This is one of the most intimate, focused and intense Tiny Desk concerts you'll find.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Step Into the Projects\"\n\"Price of the Ticket\"\n\"Forget My Name\"\n\"Fool of Me\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMeshell Ndegeocello: vocals, bass\nChris Bruce: guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Chris Bruce, Meshell Ndegeocello and Morley Kamen\nAudio: Chris Bruce and Meshell Ndegeocello\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nArt Director: CJ Riculan\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7db2X9RA2Y", "date_published": "2021-02-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "GIV\u0112ON: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week.

We hope you enjoy.\n\nSidney Madden | February 9, 2021\n\"Just bear with me while I just enjoy this and soak in it,\" GIV\u0112ON admits with a laugh. Switching between the demeanors of a seasoned, nonchalant crooner and a giddy-grinned newbie, the fast-rising R&B star makes a point to show his humility during his long-awaited debut at Tiny Desk.\n\nAccompanied by a minimal, masked-up band and only one background vocalist (a fellow Pisces at that), the baby-face baritone fills the set with resonance and light. He radiates gratitude with every note. Against a blue, moody backsplash of projected music video stills, GIV\u0112ON notes the divine timing of this performance. \"Any moment to do this would be special,\" he says between songs, \"but I think Black History Month ... just celebrating Black culture for this month, I'm really excited to get to do this on this platform.\"\n\nThrough the throes of the pandemic, GIV\u0112ON has remained remarkably busy. In a span of eight months, the Long Beach, Calif. newcomer has released two solid EPs, the Grammy-nominated Take Time and When It's All Said And Done. (The latter included one of our favorite songs of 2020, \"Still Your Best.\") For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he borrows from each project to arrange a tantalizing 14-minute sampler \u2014 showing off just enough to get you to do your Googles and discover more.\n\nMuch like the moment he's trying to savor, GIV\u0112ON's strength as a singer-songwriter is his ability to make his listener feel suspended in time. As fans quickly discovered on his breakthrough \"Chicago Freestyle\" feature last year, the peaks and valleys of GIV\u0112ON's tone and the satisfying patterns of his runs don't just serenade; They immerse, they engulf. GIV\u0112ON's star rising during a time of such sustained uncertainty is no accident, either. Between vulnerable storytelling and clear vocals, GIV\u0112ON's work provides so many with what they're craving right now: intimacy and consistency.\n\nSET LIST\n\"THE BEACH\"\n\"LIKE I WANT YOU\"\n\"Stuck On You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nGIV\u0112ON: vocals\nDeondre Ellis: keys\nIvan Chatman: bass\nAndre Montgomery: drums\nJames Murray: guitar\nRaVaughn Brown: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Jan Lim, Mitchell Schultz, Will Houlihan\nProducer: Zack Warren\nDirector: Eric Longden\nAudio: Jeremy Gray, Reggie Jones, Al Richardson\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nArt Director: CJ Riculan\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle Smith\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3MiwuLntA", "date_published": "2021-02-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
