Modern Warfare executed on an extensive year-long content plan that included new weapons, special events, and experimental modes. That all ended around the time Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War launched and took over the season pass, buried Modern Warfare in Warzone\u2019s launcher, dumped around 30 weapons into Warzone, created balance issues, and gave Modern Warfare players rewards for a game they might not own. Recent investor calls by both Activision and EA have confirmed new Call of Duty and Battlefield games targeted to release in late 2021. Not only that, but Battlefield 6 is being worked on by DICE LA, now run by Vince Zampella, an original Call of Duty developer.\n\nIn this video, Aaron and Richie talk about what was so groundbreaking about Modern Warfare, why Battlefield fans loved it, and what made them leave Battlefield in the first place. This video also looks at the studios rumored to be developing both games and what advantages they might have over each other.\u00a0\n\nThe next Call of Duty and Battlefield titles are targeted to release in 2021. Battlefield 6 will have a reveal this spring. No further information has been announced on the next Call Of Duty game, however, initial trailers often drop in April or May.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QaV-IqIvhg", "date_published": "2021-02-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Valheim First-Person Mod Gameplay", "description": "Ever wanted to play Valheim in first-person? Well, this mod from Nexus Mods user kailen37 lets you do just that.\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/44?tab=description\n\nValheim is an incredibly popular survival sim set in the Viking era. While most players are continuing to come craft and build to ensure survival, others have focused on creative ways to push the bounds of the game by developing special mods that can alter the experience in some surprising ways. One such mod--posted on the NexusMods by user kailen37--changes the camera to a third-person view, similar to games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\n\nIn this video, GameSpot video producer Dave Jewitt took some time to play with kailen37's first-person mod in order to see how much the game changes. While the game itself was designed for the third-person perspective, the altered POV is surprisingly playable, and even adds a sense of immersion that benefits the game in a noticeable way. As Dave noted, it adds a greater sense of atmosphere to Valheim's world, potentially making for a more immersive experience for those trying to survive in the dangerous land.\n\nWith the growing popularity of Valheim, the developers have stated they will continue supporting the game for the long haul. Perhaps in the game's future we'll see official support for first-person gameplay, but until then, check out this clever mod that adds a fresh perspective to the game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72m7fcrJ1cg", "date_published": "2021-02-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Guilty Gear Strive Beta - Crazy Combos For EVERY Character", "description": "We go through the entire Guilty Gear Strive Beta roster and perform a flashy combo with every single character.\n\nGuilty Gear Strive Beta released for the public February 18th, giving players the chance to try out the famed fighting game before its release on April 6th, 2021.
