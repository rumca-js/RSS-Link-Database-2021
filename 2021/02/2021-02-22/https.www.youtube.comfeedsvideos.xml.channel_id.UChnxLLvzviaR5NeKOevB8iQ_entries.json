[{"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChnxLLvzviaR5NeKOevB8iQ", "title": "Determinism (Midtempo Modular with Vocals)", "description": "Determinism is the doctrine that all events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will. Some philosophers have taken determinism to imply that individual human beings have no free will and cannot be held morally responsible for their actions. In the setting of making music in modular, I use this term to denote music that has been created with every event specifically crafted, as opposed to probabilism or generative in which a set of parameters are created and the music is born more from chance. The rack used in this setup relies heavily on deterministic events, sometimes to its detriment.\n\nThe opening noise sound is MI Warps, being fed the alt out of Plaits and the sine out of the Dixie II+. Plaits is doing chords. Piston Honda is doing basses and the big ugly swell sound. It's running through the SSF Stereo Dipole and is being modulated with the Zadar. The Stereo Dipole is also being modulated with Zadar. A mult multiplies the gate signal from Hermod for the Piston Honda to the main VCA envelope, and to all four channels of the Zadar.\n\nRings is in 2-OP FM mode and is playing a sort of electronic piano line throughout. It's signal is split between the Intellijel Rainmaker and the TipTop z5000.\n\nPico Voice is being fed into the Harvestman 1982 filter. I'm modulating the filter with a signal from the ADE-32. The ADE-32 is getting weird clocks from the KeyStep Pro, so that it doesn't always stay in the same static rhythm. Another channel of the ADE-32 is going to modulate the After Later Monsoon, which is getting a split signal from the Pico Voice and Dixie2. The Dixie is doing the long synth sound in the breakdown section.\n\nI didn't like the breakdown that much, so in Ableton I used an autofilter and reverb to diffuse it and give the vocals more space.\n\nThe drums are from the VPME QD and the Squarp Rample. They're being sequenced by the Varigate. All melodic stuff is being sequenced by the Squarp Hermod.\n\nVocals were recorded after the modular performance. One pass through the Perform-VE, and another into Ableton and processed in the DAW.\n\nSound Modules: \nPiston Honda MKIII:  https://reverb.grsm.io/pistonhonda\nPlaits: https://reverb.grsm.io/plaits\nRings\nDixie 2+\nPico Voice: https://reverb.grsm.io/espico\n\nDrums are: \nSquarp Rample: https://reverb.grsm.io/rample\nQD Quad Drum Module: https://reverb.grsm.io/vpmeqd\n\nSequencing:\nArturia Keystep Pro: https://reverb.grsm.io/keysteppro\nSquarp Hermod: https://reverb.grsm.io/hermod\nMaleko Varigate 8+: https://reverb.grsm.io/varigate8\nBusy Circuits Pam's New Workout: https://reverb.grsm.io/pams\nIntelijel Tetrapad: https://reverb.grsm.io/tetrapad\nAbstract Data ADE-32: https://reverb.grsm.io/ade32\n\nEffects: \n\nAfter Later Monsoon: https://reverb.grsm.io/almonsoon\nTipTop Audio z5000: https://reverb.grsm.io/z5000\nIntellijel Rainmaker\n\nOther stuff\nHappy Nerding VCF: https://reverb.grsm.io/hnvcf\nHappy Nerding PanMix (and Jr.): https://reverb.grsm.io/hnpanmix \nIntellijel Quad VCA: https://reverb.grsm.io/intquadvca\nNano Machines Quart: https://reverb.grsm.io/quart\nXOAC Zadar\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching. My name is Jeremy, and this is Red Means Recording. I've been making music for a few decades now, and this channel is a place to make music and to talk about the tools and techniques to make music with. We'll use synths, drum machines, modular gear, and software. \n\nIf you'd like to support the channel, I have a Patreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nI have music as \"Jeremy Blake\" on all the major services: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nI have some merch here: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nAnd you can connect with me here: \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rooYpEQHD3k", "date_published": "2021-02-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
