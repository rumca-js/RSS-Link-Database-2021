SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern in the United States—Challenges and Opportunities

JAMA, 17th February, 2021

Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPH1; Henry T. Walke, MD, MPH1; Anthony S. Fauci, MD2

January 10, 2020, the first genomic sequence isolated in Wuhan

As of February 3, 2021, 468,000 sequences uploaded to public domain

3 specific viral lineages reflecting VOCs, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.

B.1.1.7 lineage

September 2020, first detected, UK, December 2020

In at least 80 countries

In at least 33 US states 

B.1.1.7, potential, reverse the present downward trend in new infections

Highlighted the risk of domestic and international travel

February 3, 2021, B.1.1.7 variant in the US is now approaching 1%, with prevalence in some states exceeding 2%

B.1.351 lineage

October 2020, South Africa, December 2020

In at least 41 countries

South Carolina and Maryland

Demonstrated reduced response to previous ‘wild type’ antibodies

Lymphocyte response may well be the same

P.1 lineage

December 2020, travellers from Brazil

Minnesota 

Zambia

B.1.351 variant

Early December to 22 of 23 samples (96%) sequenced

December 2020 to early January 2021

16-fold increase in COVID-19 incidence

The possibility of a similar experience in the US is a real threat

First

Level of community transmission must be aggressively decreased
consistent use of face masks, 

physical distancing, 

restrictions on high-risk and high-capacity settings, 

frequent hand washing, 

delaying travel, 

widespread diagnostic testing and screening to swiftly identify and isolate infectious individuals, 

particularly those who are asymptomatic, and quarantine contacts


Second

Increased genome sequence surveillance

Third

CDC’s 750 samples per week, to more than 6000

Fourth

Accelerate SARS-CoV-2 vaccination nationally and globally

CDC is leading a comprehensive suite of studies to assess the actual effectiveness of these vaccines

Looking out for breakthrough infections



Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine 

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577

NEJM, (December 31st)

A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 94.8% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older

After 1 dose, efficacy = 52.4%

NEJM, (17th February)

But if you take data after 2 weeks …. 

https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMc2036242?articleTools=true

One Pfizer dose, vaccine efficacy of 92.6% (based on FDA data)

One Moderna dose, vaccine efficacy of 92.1% (based on FDA data)

Uncertainty about duration of protection with a single dose

Administration of a second dose within 1 month, little added benefit in the short term

Leaving high risk groups completely unprotected

Postponement of the second dose is a matter of national security that, 

if ignored, will certainly result in thousands of Covid-19–related hospitalizations and deaths this winter in the United States

hospitalizations and deaths that would have been prevented with a first dose of vaccine.

Public health Scotland

Dataset covering Scottish population of 5.4 million

A unique reference number for every individual

Link datasets, construct electronic cohort

1.2m individuals (22% of the population)

Safe haven data

Fourth week after first dose, reduced risk of hospitalisation

8 December to 15 February

1.14 million vaccines doses

21% per cent of population

Pfizer, down 84% (n = 650,000) 

Oxford-AstraZeneca, down 94% (n = 490,000)

Combined reduction in over 80s

Vaccination associated with 81% reduction in hospitalisation risk in the fourth week

UK easing

England, schools reopen 8 March

Six from 2 households outside

Care home residents, one regular visitor

Outside area trave, 29th March

Five week gaps

Four conditions

Vaccine programme continues to go to plan

Vaccines reducing hospitalisations and deaths

Infection rates do not risk a surge in hospital admissions

New variants do not fundamentally change the risk of lifting restrictions

Four tests are currently being met

Rapid drop in cases slows down

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/rapid-drop-in-cases-slows-down

February 19, 2021

Peak of 69,000 daily new cases around the 1st January

Based on data from 14,875 antigen tests

Cases now down by 80%

Current prevalence,1 in 294 people in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID

UK R value is 0.9

England, 0.9

Wales, 1.0

Scotland, 1.0 

Highest risk areas in the UK
