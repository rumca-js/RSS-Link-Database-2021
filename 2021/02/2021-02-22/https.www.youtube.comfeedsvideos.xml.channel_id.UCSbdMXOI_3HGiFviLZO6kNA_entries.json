Your number one resource for the entire week's worth of VR news. Sony drops a huge announcement this morning for a brand new VR system for the PS5 soming within the next few years. Not much is known, but here is everything we know so far! By the way I should also mention that this thumbnail is certainly NOT what the new PSVR looks like, this is just a concept render that I found on google and spruced up a little bit. A ton of other stuff happened this week as well including new full body trackers from Manus and a couple other enterprise headset updates as well. \n#tuesdaynewsday #VR #PSVR\n\nMy links-\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://youtu.be/Xp-p5RGoGpM\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nJoin my discord for good times\nhttps://discord.gg/thrill\nPatreon link:Join\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\nGAMERSUPPS Discount Code: THRILL\nhttp://gamersupps.gg/?afmc=thrill\nRidge Wallet\nridge.com/THRILL + 10% of\n\n\n\nsources-\nhttps://www.engadget.com/apple-vr-ar-headset-rumors-141606384.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIjyi3Xo7Ra5qcxZ0zdo9StAlf9A56jGR7XliGbSDpGd2RnMjWrZ9crdZGOkW_pL6FjU7q5VtRAZH_316AGJzudhZeGk22wuYTpuZezqQ-fOzLlcz0e28k_IoyULG6455DFUFTlNBW9-A_VSN0wpm3V7IBHXEBMMKIAYGEbFgpJm\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/jvc-enterprise-xr-120-fov-5k-resolution/\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/lynx-reveals-first-through-the-lens-footage-of-r-1-mr-headset/\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/leak-samsung-ar-glasses-smart-concept/\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/manus-pro-steamvr-tracker/\nhttps://vrscout.com/news/manus-pro-tracker-pro-tracking-steamvr/\nhttps://www.manus-vr.com/steamvr-tracker\nhttps://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/23/introducing-the-next-generation-of-vr-on-playstation/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/VR_memes/comments/ljzx9v/oh_childbless_your_sweet_little_heart/\n\n\n\nBen Langs Wingman in VR-\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/what-i-learned-from-building-an-iconic-weapon-from-apex-legends-in-vr/\n\nMusic- Outro Protostar: Overdrive Instrumental", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHo8fOGup0", "date_published": "2021-02-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
