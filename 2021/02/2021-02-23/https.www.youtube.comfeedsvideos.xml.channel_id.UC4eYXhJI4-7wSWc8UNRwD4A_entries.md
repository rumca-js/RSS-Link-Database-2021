Nigerian Afrobeats star Davido comes to us from his estate in Lagos with an intimate four-song performance that takes us on a mini-retrospective of his career. He and his band create a sultry vibe with a unique rendition of "Gobe," his smash 2013 single, to open the set.

Davido has long expressed pride in his father's success. He titled his 2012 debut album Omo Baba Olowo, meaning "son of a rich man" in the Yoruba language. In his (home) concert, Davido cites his father as his inspiration in a sweet and tender moment: "A Nigerian American like myself that studied in the States...I went to an HBCU, you know... My dad went to one as well and my dad used to work at Burger King. ... To become what he's become today as a Black man starting off in America has been very, very inspiring to me."

In collaboration with the Alternate Sound band, Davido strips back "Aye," a hit from 2014, with an unfettered rendition showcasing his natural voice devoid of any vocal effects. And the result sounds fantastic.

Like all touring artists, the pandemic forced Davido to spend extended time at his home instead of traveling the world. The last year allowed him to re-center himself in his motherland and inspired his 2020 release, A Better Time. Rounding out this Tiny Desk (home) concert, he concludes with "Jowo," a single from the album that of conjures hope for better times ahead.

"Freedom is what we feel when we perform. And freedom is what the world is in need of right now. In this pandemic it feels like we all need a sense of freedom." Sampa Tembo is in Lusaka, Zambia, her landlocked African home country. She's better known as Sampa The Great, an understated title. In her Tiny Desk (home) concert, the poet, rapper and singer-songwriter delivers evidence that it's more like Sampa the Greatest.

Her set is rich with earth's abundances. She performs "Rhymes To The East," "Mwana," "Freedom" and "Final Form" — the latter three off 2019's The Return — surrounded by life. Warmth pours in from exuberant trilling, zealous drums and her seven-piece band's loose movements. Dressed in warm oranges and muted browns and wearing a crown resembling red clay, Sampa is Mother Earth herself.

Initially raised in Botswana, Sampa moved to Australia as a young adult and established herself in Sydney's hip-hop scene. There, she released two mixtapes, 2015's The Great Mixtape and 2017's award-winning Birds and the BEE9, all the while generating buzz. She had been based in Melbourne for the last four years, but the next chapter of her musical journey will find her at home in Zambia.

As displayed in her Tiny Desk, Sampa's artistic strength comes from the ease with which she cultivates connectivity. Music becomes a mode of generative healing that she shares with her bandmates, some of Lusaka's best musicians, collaborators and audience. It's the type of energy people need in this moment: precious and infinite.
