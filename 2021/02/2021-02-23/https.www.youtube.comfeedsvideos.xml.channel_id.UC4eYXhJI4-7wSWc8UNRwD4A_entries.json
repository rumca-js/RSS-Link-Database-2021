We hope you enjoy.\n\nAbby O'Neill | February 24, 2021\nNigerian Afrobeats star Davido comes to us from his estate in Lagos with an intimate four-song performance that takes us on a mini-retrospective of his career. He and his band create a sultry vibe with a unique rendition of \"Gobe,\" his smash 2013 single, to open the set.\n\nDavido has long expressed pride in his father's success. He titled his 2012 debut album Omo Baba Olowo, meaning \"son of a rich man\" in the Yoruba language. In his (home) concert, Davido cites his father as his inspiration in a sweet and tender moment: \"A Nigerian American like myself that studied in the States...I went to an HBCU, you know... My dad went to one as well and my dad used to work at Burger King. ... To become what he's become today as a Black man starting off in America has been very, very inspiring to me.\"\n\nIn collaboration with the Alternate Sound band, Davido strips back \"Aye,\" a hit from 2014, with an unfettered rendition showcasing his natural voice devoid of any vocal effects. And the result sounds fantastic.\n\nLike all touring artists, the pandemic forced Davido to spend extended time at his home instead of traveling the world. The last year allowed him to re-center himself in his motherland and inspired his 2020 release, A Better Time. Rounding out this Tiny Desk (home) concert, he concludes with \"Jowo,\" a single from the album that of conjures hope for better times ahead.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Gobe\"\n\"Aye\"\n\"Risky\"\n\"Jowo\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nDavido: vocals\nGospel Obi: keyboard\nStanley Unogu: drums\nKenneth Ogueji: bass\nOrowo \"Roy\" Ubiene: keys\nBassey Kenneth: vocals\nSylvia Asuquo: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Legacy Films\nAudio: Kelvin Pro Audio\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nArt Director: CJ Riculan\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSS4FiOY8P0", "date_published": "2021-02-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Sampa The Great: Tiny Desk (Home) Concerts", "description": "NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week.

In this pandemic it feels like we all need a sense of freedom.\" Sampa Tembo is in Lusaka, Zambia, her landlocked African home country. She's better known as Sampa The Great, an understated title. In her Tiny Desk (home) concert, the poet, rapper and singer-songwriter delivers evidence that it's more like Sampa the Greatest.\n\nHer set is rich with earth's abundances. She performs \"Rhymes To The East,\" \"Mwana,\" \"Freedom\" and \"Final Form\" \u2014 the latter three off 2019's The Return \u2014 surrounded by life. Warmth pours in from exuberant trilling, zealous drums and her seven-piece band's loose movements. Dressed in warm oranges and muted browns and wearing a crown resembling red clay, Sampa is Mother Earth herself.\n\nInitially raised in Botswana, Sampa moved to Australia as a young adult and established herself in Sydney's hip-hop scene. There, she released two mixtapes, 2015's The Great Mixtape and 2017's award-winning Birds and the BEE9, all the while generating buzz. She had been based in Melbourne for the last four years, but the next chapter of her musical journey will find her at home in Zambia.\n\nAs displayed in her Tiny Desk, Sampa's artistic strength comes from the ease with which she cultivates connectivity. Music becomes a mode of generative healing that she shares with her bandmates, some of Lusaka's best musicians, collaborators and audience. It's the type of energy people need in this moment: precious and infinite.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Rhymes To The East\"\n\"Mwana\"\n\"Freedom\"\n\"Final Form\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nSampa The Great: vocals\nLazarus \"Lalo\" Zulu: keys\nKasonde \"Tek1\" Sunkutu: drums\nMapalo \"Mapskeys\" Mapalo: bass\nSamuel Masta: guitar\nMwanje Tembo: vocals\nTio Nason: vocals\nJoy Tusankine Namwila: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Carl Pires, The Nativez Media, Geo Musiwa, Isaac Tuba, Andrew Zulu\nAudio: Ben Kalulu, Andrei Eremin\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nArt Director: CJ Riculan\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svxhRbzGpMU", "date_published": "2021-02-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
