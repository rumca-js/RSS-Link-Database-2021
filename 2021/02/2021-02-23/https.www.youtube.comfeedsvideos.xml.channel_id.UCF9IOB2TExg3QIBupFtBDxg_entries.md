UK reopens

UK, 17.7 million doses of vaccine

Boris Johnson

cautious but irreversible

Decisions, data not dates

Minimum of 5 weeks apart

Time required for review of effects

no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world

Step One

England, From 8 March

All schools and colleges will open

Twice weekly testing, with masks in secondary schools

Outside, with 2 people, tea, picnic

England, From 29 March

Outdoor gatherings, six people or two households

Including private gardens

Outdoor sports allowed

Step Two

From 12 April

Pubs and restaurants open for outdoor drinking and eating

Non-essential retail opens, hairdressers and some public buildings like libraries 

Outdoor settings like alcohol takeaways, beer gardens, zoos and theme parks

Indoor leisure like swimming pools and gyms

Self-contained holiday accommodation, and camp sites

Still no indoor mixing between different households

Review of international leisure travel, announced by 12 April at the earliest

Funerals, up to 30 people, weddings up to 15 guests

Step Three

From 17 May, at the earliest

If the data allows

Outdoor, up to 30 people

Two households can mix indoors

Pubs and restaurants, eating inside, rule of six

Cinemas, museums, hotels, open

Up to 10,000 spectators outdoor

consider the potential role of Covid status certification

Step Four

From 21 June

Potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed

Nightclubs

Restrictions on weddings and funerals will also be abolished

Lancet 19th February

Military coup, Feb 1, 2021

Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM)

Clinical services have drastically diminished, leading to a health system suddenly in crisis.

Decades of underinvestment in public sector

Private and charity hospitals used, but limited

Busy public emergency departments

Were performing screening, testing, and early critical care for COVID-19

Immunisation programme had commenced
Death in inevitable, but tragic if it could have been avoided.


Mass public rallies and protests

Public compliance and goodwill for isolation

Myanmar risks profound health system collapse

Global isolation and sanctions

North Korea

Germany, Belgium, Dominican Republic, Estonia, France, UK, US, Japan

stripped of nearly all their human rights, including the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association, movement, and religion or belief

appalling and gets worse by the day

Prioritizing its nuclear weapons program over the needs of its people

longstanding, systematic, widespread and gross violations of human rights, serious threat, to international security

isolation from the international community is inevitably worsening the impacts of the pandemic on the North Korean population

Dr. Choi Jung Hun, defected in 2012

The health care system is very weak. 

They don't want to show that to the world. 

North Korea is a museum of viruses

Kim Jong Un

Not a single coronavirus case on North Korean soil

SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern in the United States—Challenges and Opportunities

JAMA, 17th February, 2021

Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPH1; Henry T. Walke, MD, MPH1; Anthony S. Fauci, MD2

January 10, 2020, the first genomic sequence isolated in Wuhan

As of February 3, 2021, 468,000 sequences uploaded to public domain

3 specific viral lineages reflecting VOCs, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.

B.1.1.7 lineage

September 2020, first detected, UK, December 2020

In at least 80 countries

In at least 33 US states 

B.1.1.7, potential, reverse the present downward trend in new infections

Highlighted the risk of domestic and international travel

February 3, 2021, B.1.1.7 variant in the US is now approaching 1%, with prevalence in some states exceeding 2%

B.1.351 lineage

October 2020, South Africa, December 2020

In at least 41 countries

South Carolina and Maryland

Demonstrated reduced response to previous ‘wild type’ antibodies

Lymphocyte response may well be the same

P.1 lineage

December 2020, travellers from Brazil

Minnesota 

Zambia

B.1.351 variant

Early December to 22 of 23 samples (96%) sequenced

December 2020 to early January 2021

16-fold increase in COVID-19 incidence

The possibility of a similar experience in the US is a real threat

First

Level of community transmission must be aggressively decreased
consistent use of face masks, 

physical distancing, 

restrictions on high-risk and high-capacity settings, 

frequent hand washing, 

delaying travel, 

widespread diagnostic testing and screening to swiftly identify and isolate infectious individuals, 

particularly those who are asymptomatic, and quarantine contacts


Second

Increased genome sequence surveillance

Third

CDC’s 750 samples per week, to more than 6000

Fourth

Accelerate SARS-CoV-2 vaccination nationally and globally

CDC is leading a comprehensive suite of studies to assess the actual effectiveness of these vaccines

Looking out for breakthrough infections



Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine 

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577

NEJM, (December 31st)

A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 94.8% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older

After 1 dose, efficacy = 52.4%

NEJM, (17th February)

But if you take data after 2 weeks …. 

https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMc2036242?articleTools=true

One Pfizer dose, vaccine efficacy of 92.6% (based on FDA data)

One Moderna dose, vaccine efficacy of 92.1% (based on FDA data)

Uncertainty about duration of protection with a single dose

Administration of a second dose within 1 month, little added benefit in the short term

Leaving high risk groups completely unprotected

Postponement of the second dose is a matter of national security that, 

if ignored, will certainly result in thousands of Covid-19–related hospitalizations and deaths this winter in the United States

hospitalizations and deaths that would have been prevented with a first dose of vaccine.
