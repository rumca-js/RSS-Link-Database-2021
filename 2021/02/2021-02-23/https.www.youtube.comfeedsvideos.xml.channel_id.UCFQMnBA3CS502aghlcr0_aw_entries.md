this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.

Millionaire High School Dropout Drives Lambo To Flex On Their Old Classmates

BTW I have no problem with High School Dropouts in general. life happens, it's fine. You're not better or worse b/c of your education, but to flex your wealth on your old high school is cringe at a level hard to explain.
