The game was released five years after the last home console entry, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and we wouldn\u2019t get the next home console release, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for almost six years--though we did get some other Zelda games along the way like A Link Between Worlds, so it wasn\u2019t completely empty.\n\nThe Wii is an SD console with games outputting at 480p, so despite the PS3 and Xbox 360 being around and HD being a thing in 2011, Skyward Sword was only ever seen in SD before now. You\u2019ll also notice in this comparison video that the Switch version is running a lot more smoothly in comparison to the original Wii version. On Wii, Skyward Sword runs at 30fps while the Switch version looks to be running at 60fps.\u00a0\n\nThe Wind Waker and Twilight Princess both got the HD treatment back on Wii U, so it was only a matter of time for Skyward Sword to get the same treatment. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD releases on Nintendo Switch on July 16 with newly added button controls as the original version only had motion controls.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxZTQ4CKa1k", "date_published": "2021-02-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call Of Duty Should Be Afraid Of Battlefield Again", "description": "Modern Warfare 2019 attracted lapsed Battlefield players but now with the problematic integration and takeover of Call Of Duty by Cold War, it\u2019s time to see if the door is open for Battlefield 6 to take the big team battle crown back.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nModern Warfare 2019 attracted lapsed Battlefield players by breaking from Call Of Duty\u2019s formula using mil-sim-inspired weapon handling, big team battle modes, and Warzone. Modern Warfare executed on an extensive year-long content plan that included new weapons, special events, and experimental modes. That all ended around the time Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War launched and took over the season pass, buried Modern Warfare in Warzone\u2019s launcher, dumped around 30 weapons into Warzone, created balance issues, and gave Modern Warfare players rewards for a game they might not own. Recent investor calls by both Activision and EA have confirmed new Call of Duty and Battlefield games targeted to release in late 2021. Not only that, but Battlefield 6 is being worked on by DICE LA, now run by Vince Zampella, an original Call of Duty developer.\n\nIn this video, Aaron and Richie talk about what was so groundbreaking about Modern Warfare, why Battlefield fans loved it, and what made them leave Battlefield in the first place. This video also looks at the studios rumored to be developing both games and what advantages they might have over each other.\u00a0\n\nThe next Call of Duty and Battlefield titles are targeted to release in 2021. Battlefield 6 will have a reveal this spring. No further information has been announced on the next Call Of Duty game, however, initial trailers often drop in April or May.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QaV-IqIvhg", "date_published": "2021-02-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Valheim First-Person Mod Gameplay", "description": "Ever wanted to play Valheim in first-person? Well, this mod from Nexus Mods user kailen37 lets you do just that.\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/44?tab=description\n\nValheim is an incredibly popular survival sim set in the Viking era. While most players are continuing to come craft and build to ensure survival, others have focused on creative ways to push the bounds of the game by developing special mods that can alter the experience in some surprising ways. One such mod--posted on the NexusMods by user kailen37--changes the camera to a third-person view, similar to games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\n\nIn this video, GameSpot video producer Dave Jewitt took some time to play with kailen37's first-person mod in order to see how much the game changes. While the game itself was designed for the third-person perspective, the altered POV is surprisingly playable, and even adds a sense of immersion that benefits the game in a noticeable way. As Dave noted, it adds a greater sense of atmosphere to Valheim's world, potentially making for a more immersive experience for those trying to survive in the dangerous land.\n\nWith the growing popularity of Valheim, the developers have stated they will continue supporting the game for the long haul. Perhaps in the game's future we'll see official support for first-person gameplay, but until then, check out this clever mod that adds a fresh perspective to the game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72m7fcrJ1cg", "date_published": "2021-02-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
