The 2010 documentary, "Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child," is now available for streaming on several platforms. The documentary, directed by Tamra Davis and released by Arthouse Films/Cinedigm, covers the life of the New York visual artist who, it has been said, had an audience that "wasn't born yet."

"This film is amazing," Mary says. "Through interviews through watching him paint, listening to jazz — to bebop, specifically — you get such a close look into one of my favorite artists in the world."
