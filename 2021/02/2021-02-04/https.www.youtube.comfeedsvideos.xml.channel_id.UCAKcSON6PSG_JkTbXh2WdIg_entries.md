It was six years ago that the band The Last Revel first performed in our studio. Since that time, the Minneapolis-based "front porch Americana" band have undergone some lineup changes — and they even almost threw in the towel. But their most recent visit to our studio was in June 2019, and it was a jubilant session as The Last Revel played songs from their album, "Fool's Spring," which they recorded in Nashville.

Watch three songs from The Last Revel's June 2019 session.

## Temples - three songs at The Current (2020)

One year ago this week, rock band Temples visited our studio — one of just a handful of studio sessions we hosted in 2020 — to play some songs ahead of a sold-out show at the 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis. 

Lush arrangements and big-sounding guitars and keys give Temples a lot of room to create big sounds. "I think generally, we sort of know instinctively whether something should be lo-fi and echoey, or in your face and like a broken, fuzzy tape machine," Bagshaw said at the time. "It's one of those things where you follow your instinct, really."

Watch Temples perform three songs from their 2019 album, "Hot Motion."

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "The Howl"
4:26 "Holy Horses"
7:33 "You're Either On Something"

PERSONNEL
James Bagshaw – vocals, guitar
Rens Ottink – drums
Adam Smith – guitar, keyboards 
Tom Walmsley – bass
