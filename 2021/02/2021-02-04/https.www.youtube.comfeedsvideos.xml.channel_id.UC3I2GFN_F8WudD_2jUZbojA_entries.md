http://KEXP.ORG presents a rebroadcast of BEARAXE performing during Shelter Fest 2020. 

Shelter Fest Seattle (https://www.shelterfestseattle.com/) is a community-driven, live-streamed benefit music festival providing direct support to Black artists and restaurant owners in the greater Seattle area during the pandemic.

While COVID-19 and the statewide shelter-in-place mandate disproportionately impact the arts and food service industries, Black artists and restaurant owners are some of the hardest hit. With the lack of support from the government, we believe that mutual aid and joint community efforts are some of the most critical ways we can show up for our community.
