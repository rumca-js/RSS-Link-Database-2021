Sputnik V (Gam-Covid-Vac)

 2 doses, 3 weeks apart

Muscle injection

Freezer storage

Developing an alternative formulation that can be refrigerated

Gamaleya Research Institute (Ministry of Health)

Combination of two adenoviruses called Ad5 and Ad26

August 11th President Putin announced approval

Before phase 3 trials had started

November, Russian government began offering Sputnik V within Russia

Widespread hesitancy

Phase 3, Russia, Belarus, UAE, Venezuela, India

Background

A heterologous recombinant adenovirus

Phase 2 results,

showed a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses

Interim analysis of this phase 3 trial 
Methods

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial

25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow

Participants at least 18 years, with negative PCR and IgG and IgM tests

Randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo

Two shots, 21 days apart

First dose, rAd26

Second dose, rAd5),

Both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S

Outcome recorded 21 days after second shot (vaccine or placebo)

Finding

Sept 7 to Nov 24, 2020

N = 21 977

Randomly assigned

Vaccine group, n = 16 501

Placebo group, n = 5476

N = 19 866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included

(2,144 participants older than 60 years, 1,611 in the vaccine group and 533 in the placebo group)

Primary outcome analysis

Included all participants who had received at least two doses at the time of database lock

Vaccine group, n = 14,964

16 (0·1%) confirmed COVID infections

No cases of moderate or severe COVID-19 confirmed at least 21 days after dose 1

Placebo group, n = 4,902

62 (1·3%) confirmed COVID infections

20 cases of moderate or severe COVID-19 confirmed at least 21 days after dose 1

Efficacy

91·6%

Vaccine efficacy was 91·8 in participants older than 60 years

Interim immunogenicity 

Vaccine group

RBD-specific IgG detected in 336 (98%) of 342 samples

Seroconversion rate of 98·25%

Higher levels of interferon-gamma

(secreted by activated T helper lymphocytes, T cytotoxic lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and NKs)

Significantly higher levels of IFN-γ secretion upon antigen restimulation

Placebo group

RBD-specific IgG was detected in 17 (15%) of 114 samples

Seroconversion rate of 14·91%

(p less than 0·0001 vs the vaccine group)

Adverse events

Grade 1

7485 [94·0%] of 7966 total events

Serous adverse events

Vaccine group


45 (0·3%) of 16, 427

Placebo group

23 (0·4%) of 5435

None were considered associated with vaccination

Four deaths were reported during the study

Vaccine group

Three (less than 0·1%) of 16 427

Placebo group

One (less than 0·1%) of 5435

None of which were considered related to the vaccine

Interpretation

This interim analysis of the phase 3 trial of Gam-COVID-Vac showed 91·6% efficacy against COVID-19 and was well tolerated in a large cohort

Habitual use of vitamin D supplements and risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection: a prospective study in UK Biobank (29th January, 2021)

https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcn/nqaa381/6123965

The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition

Background 

Vitamin D supplementation, lower risk of acute respiratory tract infection

Emerging evidence, vitamin D insufficiency is related to a higher risk of coronavirus infection and disease

Objectives

To investigate the prospective association between habitual use of vitamin D supplements and risk of COVID- 19 infection

Associations according to levels of circulating and genetically predicted vitamin D

Methods

N = 8,297 adults

Records of COVID-19 test results from UK Biobank

16 March 2020 to 29 June 2020

Results

Of the 8,297 adults, 1,374 (16.6%) tested positive

Vit D users, n = 363

Non-vit D users, n = 7,934

Unadjusted model

OR 0.78 (p = 0.105)

Adjustment for covariates

Age, sex, race, origin (outpatient or inpatient), blood-type, years of education, TDI, smoking, moderate drinking, physical activity, healthy diet score, use of any other supplements 

Inverse association emerged

Between habitual use of vitamin D supplements and risk of COVID-19 infection

OR, 0.66, (P = 0.038)

Habitual use of vitamin D supplements was significantly associated with a 34% lower risk of COVID-19 infection

No association with baseline blood vitamin D levels and risk of COVID-19 infection

Associations between the risk of COVID-19 infection and habitual use of other individual supplements

Vitamin D Deficiency and Outcome of COVID-19 Patients

Medical University Hospital Heidelberg, (September 2020)

https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/9/2757

Identification of modifiable prognostic factors may help to improve outcomes

N = 185, diagnosed and treated in Heidelberg

Median Vitamin D level was 16.6 ng/ml

Associations of vitamin D status with disease severity and survival

Vitamin D status assessed at first presentation

Deficient

25-hydroxyvitamin D (Calcifediol)
level less than 12 ng/mL ( less than 30 nM)

N = 41 (22%)

Median IL-6 levels at hospitalization were significantly higher 

70.5 versus 29.7 pg/mL

Insufficiency

Less than 20 ng/mL (less than 50 nM) 

N = 118 (64%)

Higher levels

N = 26

Median Vitamin D level was significantly lower in the inpatient versus the outpatient subgroup

Results

Median observation period of 66 days

93 (50%) patients required hospitalization

28 patients required ventilation

Including 16 deaths

Adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities

Deficiency was associated with higher risk of ventilation and death

Mechanical ventilation

HR 6.12

p less than 0.001

Death

HR 14.73

p less than 0.001

Other hazard ratios

Male, 1.69 2.5

Over 60, 3.2    7.7

Comorbidity, 2.7 5.3

Need for interventional studies

Cholecalciferol

Calcifediol

Active form of vitamin D3, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), calcitriol, is 
pluripotent hormone and important modulator of both innate and adaptive immunity
