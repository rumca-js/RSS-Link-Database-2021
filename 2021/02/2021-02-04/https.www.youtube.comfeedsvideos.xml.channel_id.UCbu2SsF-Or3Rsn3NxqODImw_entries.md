Looking for a new wireless gaming mouse? Look no further, as we put the most high-end tech and peripherals up against the more budget-friendly options to see which device is most worth their price.

First we have the Razer Naga Pro, a modular wireless gaming mouse featuring three swappable side plates designed across different game genres, hyperspeed wireless technology, over 19 buttons, and a 20,000 DPI. All of this comes in at around $150 USD.
Secondly, on the more fiscally responsible side of these devices, we have the SteelSeries Rival 3 wireless, featuring a 400+ hour battery life, SteelSeries’ “pixel-perfect” TrueMove Air optical sensor, and an 18,000 DPI. This package is going to set you back a much more reasonable $50 USD.

But which of these fantastic mice are worth their price?

Skill-based matchmaking has become a huge problem in Call Of Duty so let’s explore if SBMM is as unfair as people think it is. 

A lot of Call Of Duty streamers are saying that skill-based matchmaking has been ruining their Warzone experience. Some of the issues are being grouped in with cheaters, sweaty matches, and unfair rounds. Players have also been thrown into bot lobbies with extremely low skilled players which isn’t fun for anyone. 

In this video, we talk about how players experience SBMM, why they feel the way they do, and why Activision probably won’t get rid of it. We also dive into what one expert, Josh Menke, who has worked on matchmaking in Halo and Call Of Duty, has said about fairness and player perception. We also get into how large skill gaps can drive players away from a game and the importance of good matchmaking. 

Call Of Duty: Warzone combines elements of Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold war which are available for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

Apex Legends had a transformative second year--four new characters, two new weapons, a third map, and more balancing adjustments than we can possibly list. But we can at least go over the big stuff.

In the video above, Jordan Ramée details Apex Legends' highs, lows, and biggest changes during the battle royale game's second year. That's everything major that occurred during Season 4: Assimilation, Season 5: Fortune's Favor, Season 6: Boosted, and Season 7: Ascension. 

During that time, Apex Legends saw the addition of playable characters Revenant, Loba, Rampart, and Horizon, as well as the Sentinel sniper rifle and the Volt submachine gun. How players both fought one another and managed their loot also changed as new items like Evo Shields, Mobile Respawn Beacons, and Replicators were added throughout the year.

It's a great time to jump back into Apex Legends as Season 8: Mayhem has begun. Season 8 kicks off Apex Legends' third year with a bang, adding playable character Fuse, the 30-30 Repeater, and quite a few welcome map changes to Kings Canyon.

Jean-Luc argues that Hitman can be a better experience if you disable some of its key HUD elements.

The joy of Hitman comes from a mastery of its levels. Learning their layouts, planning the perfect hit, or adapting to a changing situation. But what do you do once you’ve mastered Hitman? You make it harder for yourself.

In this video, Jean-Luc Seipke talks about how the experience of playing Hitman 3 can significantly change when you disable key HUD features such as Mission Story Guidance and Instincts Mode. Both are great tools for helping out players but Jean-Luc argues that without them you’re forced to act more cautiously and creatively, creating a more thrilling Hitman experience. And of course just for fun he also tries the game without any HUD just to see what it’s like.

## God Of War PS5 vs PS4 Pro - Loading Times & Gameplay Comparison

God of War (2018) is a gorgeous game, but with the latest PS5 patch it looks even better. Here's a side by side comparison of the PS5 and PS4 Pro versions.

God of War is a great game--one of our favorites of 2018. It's a pretty good-looking exclusive for PlayStation 4 as well, so we figured that checking out the game on PS5 following the release of its new gen console upgrades was in order.

In the video above, we play through God of War on both PS4 Pro and PS5. We also do a side-by-side comparison of the game's load times on the two different consoles, providing a clear view of just how much faster the game loads on PS5.

And speaking of loading, did you know that developer Sony Santa Monica had to pull off some exceptionally clever tricks in order to make that scene as awe-inspiring and cool-looking as it did? If you've played God of War, you know exactly which scene we're talking about. On the first episode of Audio Logs, game director Cory Barlog offers his insight into how God of War's most memorable scene was ultimately created.

If you haven't yet played God of War, you probably want to skip that episode of Audio Logs until you do. The game is definitely worth your time--as seen in GameSpot's God of War review, which reads: "In many ways God of War is what the series has always been. It's a spectacular action game with epic set pieces, big-budget production values, and hard-hitting combat that grows more feverish and impressive as you progress. What may surprise you is how mature its storytelling has become. Like Kratos, God of War recalls the past while acknowledging the need to improve. Everything new it does is for the better, and everything it holds onto benefits as a result. Kratos is no longer a predictable brute. God of War is no longer an old-fashioned action series. With this reboot, it confidently walks a new path that will hopefully lead to more exciting adventures to come."
