European and Asian countries

Second wave, consistent with many remaining susceptible

Manaus, Brazil

Blood donors, 76% had been infected by October 2020

Also, estimated attack rates in Amazon Basin, 70% 

Estimated SARS-CoV-2 attack rate in Manaus, above theoretical herd immunity threshold of 67%

(based on a reproduction number of 3)

But January 2021

Manaus hospital admissions, 3,431

(552 in Dec 1–19, 2020)

May to November, relaxation of control measures, low admissions for 7 months

There are at least four non-mutually exclusive possible explanations for the resurgence of COVID-19 in Manaus. 

Why a resurgence of cases?

First factor, first wave overestimated

Attack rate could have been overestimated during the first wave

June, seroprevalence, 52·5%

Second factor, waning immunity

Waning of IgG antibody titres observed in blood donors 

Most of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in Manaus occurred 7–8 months before resurgence in January, 2021

(No observed behaviour change in Manaus, reduced population mobility)

If resurgence in Manaus is due to waning, similar resurgence everywhere



Third factor, antigenic escape

New SARS-CoV-2 lineages

Circulating in Brazil, B.1.1.7 and P.1

P.1 detected in Manaus on Jan 12, 2021

P.1 lineage, accrued ten unique spike protein mutations,

Including E484K 

P.2 lineage also detected Manaus

P.2 independently accrued the spike E484K mutation

In-vitro evidence that E484K mutation reduces neutralisation by polyclonal antibodies in convalescent sera

Antigenic escape

Fourth factor, increased transmissibility

SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the second wave might have higher inherent transmissibility

Eg. Relative prevalence of P.1 lineage, up to 42% by  December, 2020

P.1 lineage

Shares several independently acquired mutations

B.1.1.7 (N501)

B.1.325 (K417N/T, E484K, N501Y)

Conclusions

Variants need to be quickly investigated

Genetic, immunological, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics

Serological and genomic surveillance in Manaus is a priority

Determining vaccine is also crucial
Rapid sharing of lineage-specific frequencies underlying reinfection

## US possible resurgence, SA possible mistake

Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States

California, 7 February 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.06.21251159v1

B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, has gained a strong foothold across the world

Detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere

Doubling rate of a little over a week

Increased transmission rate of 35-45%

Several independent introductions

From late November 2020

Onward community transmission, 40 states

U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant

Requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality

B117 is becoming dominant in Florida

Quarantine for 14 days

https://www.wits.ac.za/covid19/covid19-news/latest/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trial-results.html

One million doses arrived

Minimal protection against SA variant

Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, rollout paused

Variant became dominant in November

No significant protection against illness, but all the cases of disease were mild or moderate

Vaccinated people will probably still allow ongoing transmission

As has been recently reported in those with prior infection

The study

Witwatersrand and Oxford

N = 2,000

Examined adults between 18 and 64

Seven sites in South Africa

Last summer and fall

B.1.351 (92% of all current cases in SA)

Eeek mutation, E484K

E = Glutamate

K = Lysine

N501Y as well

Three US states, Virginia

SA variant in the UK

https://news.sky.com/story/uk-covid-news-latest-updates-on-coronavirus-lockdown-and-vaccine-12212131

Cases, 147


Vaccine group

19 cases of covid-19 caused by the variant

Mild disease was defined as at least one symptom of COVID-19


Placebo group

20 cases

Suggests 10% effective

Or 22%

Participants in the trial were young and healthy

Median age 31

Therefore, severe disease protection unknown

Novavax and Johnson & Johnson, 50 to 60%

Janssen, (J and J) protected against moderate to severe disease

Might need to move from hoped for herd immunity to individual severe disease protection

Vaccine after effects
