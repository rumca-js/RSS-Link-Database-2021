An excerpt from the new FRONTLINE documentary "Iraq's Assassins" looks at al-Hashimi's murder. Officially, the Iraqi government said the case is still under investigation.

“Who are the people behind his killing?” correspondent Ramita Navai asks an intelligence officer involved in the case,  who agreed to talk, as long as FRONTLINE concealed his identity.

“Mercenaries hired by one of the powerful militias in Iraq as retribution for Hisham talking about them to the media … Kata’ib Hezbollah,” says the officer.
