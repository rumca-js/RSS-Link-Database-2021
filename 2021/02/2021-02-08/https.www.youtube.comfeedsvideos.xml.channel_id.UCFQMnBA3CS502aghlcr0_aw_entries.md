this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.

StoryFire recently "almost shut down" and got suddenly saved... I want to talk about this, since I believe in the storyfire vision but hate the way the founders are treating the company like a youtube drama. We also talk about Jesse Tyler Ridgway from McJuggernuggets, creator of the psycho series.

This is the worst and most poorly thought out bitcoin scam I've ever seen, and that's saying a LOT. My only reasoning is that Jay Mazini must really not care anymore.
