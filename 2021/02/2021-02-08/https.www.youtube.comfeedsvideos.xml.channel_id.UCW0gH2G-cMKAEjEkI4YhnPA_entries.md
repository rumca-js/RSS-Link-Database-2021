As we celebrate 150,000 subscribers, I just received my Silver (or is it Mithril?) Play Button in the mail!  I decided to record opening it for the first time to share with all of my wonderful subscribers!  Thank you so much for watching, liking, sharing, and of course subscribing here on Nerd of the Rings!!

(Sorry about not having good audio - in my sleep-deprived state after the 24hr livestream, I forgot to hit the record button on my recorder.)
