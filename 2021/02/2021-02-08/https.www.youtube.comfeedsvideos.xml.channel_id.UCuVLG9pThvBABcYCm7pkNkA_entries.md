Okay, first of all, welcome to the channel. We're happy too see General Motors pivoting to electric vehicles after making countless bad decisions for the environment including torpedoing clean air legislation and funding climate denial. That being said, I sincerely hope GM is on the right path here. Original Commercial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdsPvbSpB2Y
