With the lack of support from the government, we believe that mutual aid and joint community efforts are some of the most critical ways we can show up for our community.\n\nSupport the Seattle Artists Relief Fund through this video or visit https://www.shelterfestseattle.com", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWQpqM9TFfo", "date_published": "2021-02-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC3I2GFN_F8WudD_2jUZbojA", "title": "Arlo Parks - Full Performance (Live on KEXP at Home)", "description": "http://KEXP.ORG presents Arlo Parks performing live, recorded exclusively for KEXP. \n\n Songs:\nIntro\nPaperbacks\nCola\nGreen Eyes\nEugene\nBlack Dog\nCaroline\nHurt\nSophie\n\nSession Recorded at Unwound Studios, London\nDirected by Vince Lee and Adrian Lee - Apollo Films\nMixing by Mike Hill \n\nBand:\nAlex Blake (guitar)\nSam Harding (bass)\nJames Fernandez (drums)\n\nhttps://www.arloparksofficial.com\n\ufffchttp://kexp.org", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQHmIt9OVGU", "date_published": "2021-02-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
