And it just looks so good. But you don't need to just take our word for it, you can check it out for yourself.\n\nIn the video above, we showcase how Control on PS4 compares with Control: Ultimate Edition on PS5. We first test the game's loading speeds, putting Control on both base PS4 and PS4 Pro up against the Ultimate Edition on PS5. After that, we dive into some side-by-side gameplay comparisons. Don't worry, if you've yet to play Control, you won't find any major spoilers here. We just go through the first 20 minutes of the game's campaign.\n\nIn GameSpot's Control review, Peter Brown writes, \"It's not often that a game invades my thoughts the way Control has. I'm at the point where I want to consume every last thing it has to offer. And if I'm honest, it also makes me want to go back and replay Remedy's past games, too. Sure, it's a faulty metroidvania in some respects, but there are so many exceptional qualities afoot that Control handily deflects any momentary ire.\"\n\nOn top of that, Phil Hornshaw adds that the Ultimate Edition, with \"its graphical add-ons, the stability and performance enhancements, and the inclusion of all of Control's DLC,\" is \"the best way to experience Control--and the PS5's haptics really add an extra layer of intensity to a game that already feels great to play.\" \n\nControl is available for Xbox One, PS4, Luna, PC, and Switch, while the Ultimate Edition is available for Xbox Series X|S and PS5.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P1vx-6Dx98", "date_published": "2021-02-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Inside \"Firebase Z\" \u2013 Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Zombies", "description": "The Dark Aether story continues with \u201cFirebase Z\u201d in Black Ops Cold War Zombies on February 4th.

We recently attended a presentation with Bioware and, boy, are they making a lot of tweaks. \n\nIn the above video, Lucy has put together an exhaustive list of everything they're tweaking, changing, enhancing, and improving in the Legendary Edition. Most important among these is perhaps the sweeping changes to the original Mass Effect. It's a classic but, compared to Mass Effect 2 and 3, it is showing and feeling its age the most. \n\nLucy also breaks down just what is going to happen to Galactic Readiness without Mass Effect 3's multiplayer, and what will become of our beloved elevator rides thanks to quicker load times on current consoles and PC. \n\nMass Effect Legendary Edition will launch on May 14 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam and Origin. It's also forward compatible with Xbox Series and PlayStation 5.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdwafYDlXtU", "date_published": "2021-02-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
