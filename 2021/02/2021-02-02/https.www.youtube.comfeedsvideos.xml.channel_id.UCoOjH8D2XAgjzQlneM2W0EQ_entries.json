Is Cathie Wood the next Warren Buffet of disruptive tech or just lucky?\n\nCathie\u2019s career started with a degree in Finance and Economics  in 1981. She started as an Assistant Economist, then spent the next 40 years climbing the ranks of high finance, eventually managing over $5 billion dollars in assets as the Chief Investment Officer at AllianceBernstein. \n\nIn 2014, she registered the ARK Investment Management LLC with the SEC.\n\nCathie and ARK\u2019s entire investing strategy centers around throwing money into what she calls Innovation Platforms with three things: 1. Costs start high but as more of the product is produced, the price goes down until it reaches a point of critical mass. 2. These Innovation Platforms cut across the economy, different sectors, and spread across the world, like electricity. And 3. They end up helping people create even more innovation.\n\nCathie argues that this era is going to be the biggest, fastest period of growth humanity has ever seen.\n\nHer company\u2019s popular products are their actively managed ETFs. The ETFs they currently have are the ARK Innovation ETF, Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF, Next Generation Internet ETF, Genomic Revolution ETF, the Fintech Innovation ETF, and soon, a space exploration ETF. She\u2019s expecting to have low 20% returns for the next few years and an entire doubling over the next 5 years.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to open up a hedge fund or a VC firm and offer rich people access to private investments that they wouldn\u2019t normally be able to invest in. \n\nThe Innovation Fund Business Model. Step 1: you want to inspire people by tapping into that religious, sacred aspect of their psychology. Step 2: Invest in overhyped companies that anyone else can buy so you kinda just ride the wave. Step 3: Collect huge fees compared to other passively managed ETFs.  This is nothing new, and it\u2019s kinda like what Wall Street was doing during the dotcom and telecom bubble of the 90\u2019s.\n----------------------\n\nMusic by Erang : https://erang.bandcamp.com \nShopan - There and Back https://chll.to/3d949b09 \nNo Spirit - Reliving https://chll.to/d61278d4 \n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
