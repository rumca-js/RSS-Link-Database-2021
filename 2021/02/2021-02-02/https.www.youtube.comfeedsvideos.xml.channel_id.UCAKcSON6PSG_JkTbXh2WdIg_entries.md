Mary Lucia has a two-fer for you, thanks to musician, actor, painter and all-around interesting person John Lurie. HBO recently launched the series, "Painting with John," and two episodes in, Mary Lucia is completely charmed by it. And it reminds Mary of the earlier series from Lurie called "Fishing with John," in which Lurie goes on fishing trips with his friends, who include Dennis Hopper, Jim Jarmusch, Willem Dafoe and Tom Waits. "When somebody's that interesting and has a lot to say and offer, it's great," Mary says. "It's really charming."

## X - three songs at Rock the Garden 2019

February 1 is the birthday of Exene Cervenka, frontwoman of the iconic Los Angeles punk band, X.

It's wild to think that more than 40 years have passed since the legendary X first roared out of the Los Angeles punk scene — and even wilder that this pioneering group are still performing together today. Their impact on the music industry is massive — both of their first two albums are on the Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time — and founding members John Doe and Exene Cervenka have gone on to pursue successful solo careers, with John racking up quite the list of film and television credits as well. But there's nothing quite like seeing the four members of X on stage together.

Watch three songs performed live by X at Rock the Garden 2019; these three songs come from X's albums "Los Angeles," "More Fun in the New World" and "Under the Big Black Sun," respectively. 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Your Phone's Off the Hook, But You're Not"
2:31 "True Love"
4:59 "The Hungry Wolf"

PERSONNEL
Exene Cervenka – vocals
DJ Bonebrake – drums
John Doe – bass 
Billy Zoom – guitar
