August\n\nSpread of variant B.1.1.7\n\nIncreased transmission behaviour\n\nDaily case decline, vaccination increases, = behaviors to increased transmission\n\nInfections are expected to increase after mid-March at least for 4-6 weeks\n\nCases, decline until mid-March, then increase to over 200,000 again by early April\n\nStress on hospital capacity in some states\n\nDeaths not increasing due to vaccination\n\nDeaths by 1st June\n\nVaccinations, 145 million adults (preventing 114,000 deaths)\n\nDeaths, 616,000\n\nDaily deaths should continue to decline\n\nMask wearing, 76% (always wore a mask when leaving home)\n\nUniversal mask coverage (95%) = 34,000 fewer cumulative deaths\n\nUnknown protection of previous infection to VOC B.1.351\n\nCurrent situation \n\n18% of people in the US have been infected as of February 8\n\n59 million\n\nCumulative infection rates greater than 25%: North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and New York\n\nSouth Africa uses Johnson & Johnson\n\nUnused, 1 million
