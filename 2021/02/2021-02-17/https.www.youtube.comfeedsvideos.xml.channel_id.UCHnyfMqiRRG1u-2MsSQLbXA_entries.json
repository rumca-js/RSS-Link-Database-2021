It is a wonderful robot, made out of steel and wire \u2014 but will future robots look like Perseverance? There is an emerging field of  research on \"soft robots\", where the machines are flexible. These soft robots have many advantages over traditional robots \u2014 they're safer, lighter, more flexible and can change their shape and size.\n\nNASA is investigating the use of soft robots for space missions. For future visits to Enceladus or Europa, a lander could cut a hole in the ice and then insert a compliant robot through the hole. This robot could then grow and change shape on the other side.\n\nReferences:\nN. S. Usevitch, Z. M. Hammond, M. Schwager, A. M. Okamura, E. W. Hawkes, S.
