One of the songs, \"The Bride's Dad,\" tells the story of something Leithauser and his wife witnessed at a friend's wedding in upstate New York five years prior. \"There was an uninvited, unwanted guest who turned out to be the bride's dad,\" Leithauser recalled. \"He got up on the stage and he gave this really awesome toast, that we loved, and he sang that song, 'Wild Mountain Thyme,' which I've always loved. He was sort of in tears when he was singing it, and I was so gripped \u2026 After he sang it, I was ready to burst out in applause, and then I realized we were the only ones who were charmed.\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"In a Black Out\"\n3:33 \"The Bride's Dad\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nHamilton Leithauser \u2013 guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark, Elijah Deaton-Berg\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2014 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/07/11/hamilton-leithauser-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/02/16/hamilton-leithauser-performs-a-solo-acoustic-set-at-the-current\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#hamiltonleithauser", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyu6wT3Mdec", "date_published": "2021-02-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Craig Finn - two songs at The Current (2017)", "description": "Four years ago this week, The Current got a great treat when Craig Finn visited our studio to perform some songs from his then-forthcoming solo record, \"We All Want the Same Things.\"\n\nFinn is originally from Minnesota, and he is known for songs that contain plenty of geographical and cultural references to the North Star State, but Finn has made New York his home for more than a decade. \"I like a lot of alone time,\" he said. \"I can think better if I'm surrounded by chaos but I'm not having to deal with anyone.
