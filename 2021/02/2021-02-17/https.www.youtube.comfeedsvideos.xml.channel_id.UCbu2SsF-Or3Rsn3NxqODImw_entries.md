Destiny 1's first strike, The Devils' Lair, has been added to Destiny 2 and we compare it to the original to see if there are any notable differences. Destiny 1 is running on PS4 Pro and Destiny 2 is running on PS5.

 

The old is new again, as Bungie just introduced Destiny 1’s first strike, The Devil’s Lair, into Destiny 2. But what kinds of differences can you expect in terms of improvements?

 

In a new video, we take a look at the strike in its original form in Destiny 1 and compare it to how it looks in Destiny 2. As you’ll see, there are some differences you may want to be aware of. Check out the full video to get a closer look at the new version of The Devil’s Lair and soak in the nostalgia of seeing the original Destiny strike inside Bungie’s sequel.

 

Expect a lot more Destiny 2 coverage from GameSpot now and in the future, as we’ll have lots more to share and cover on the Season of the Chosen.

Here are the most action-packed gameplay moments from our time with Knockout City's closed beta, an all-new dodgeball inspired multiplayer game.

Knockout City is EA's take on what a high-energy and high-flying take on dodgeball would be in the far future. Coming from Velan Studios, the game is a tactical team-based arena brawler that takes the concept of dodgeball and amps it up by several degrees. Described as a "dodge-brawler" by the developers, Knockout City puts you in the role of a newcomer to the big city who joins a gang and has to defend their new territory from rivals looking to take over. These engagements take place on several dodgeball arenas across the city, set in construction sites, rooftops of skyscrapers, and even on the busy streets of downtown.

We had the chance to get some hands-on time with Knockout City's upcoming closed beta, which will occur on February 20th through the 21st. In the beta, players will be able to customize their "dodge-brawler" and join other crew members to face off against rivals in the Team KO match type, which is Knockout City's take on the classic 3v3 team deathmatch mode. In this gameplay video, you can see all the different types of moves, team cross-ups, and tricks you can pull on your enemies to score a hit. 

Coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch on May 21st, Knockout City is shaping up to be a fun and accessible take on classic multiplayer combat. We'll have more on Knockout City coming up as we approach its launch in the months ahead.
