Gardenview out now, listen on Spotify (https://sptfy.com/gardenview) or wherever you listen to music.

 This song is a masterpiece. Roy Orbison has a couple songs about dreaming, and his most popular one is called "In Dreams." But between you and me..."Dream" is better. This is just...as good as it gets, I think. (So a fan just pointed out that this song is actually by Johnny Mercer. Whoops! That said, my cover is a cover of Roy Orbison's rendition. A cover of a cover :) But I wanted to at least credit the original songwriter here. Thanks for letting me know!)

LYRICS 

Dream, when you're feeling blue
Dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream, when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream dream

Dream, when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream dream
