Coming from Velan Studios, the game is a tactical team-based arena brawler that takes the concept of dodgeball and amps it up by several degrees. Described as a \"dodge-brawler\" by the developers, Knockout City puts you in the role of a newcomer to the big city who joins a gang and has to defend their new territory from rivals looking to take over. These engagements take place on several dodgeball arenas across the city, set in construction sites, rooftops of skyscrapers, and even on the busy streets of downtown.\n\nWe had the chance to get some hands-on time with Knockout City's upcoming closed beta, which will occur on February 20th through the 21st. In the beta, players will be able to customize their \"dodge-brawler\" and join other crew members to face off against rivals in the Team KO match type, which is Knockout City's take on the classic 3v3 team deathmatch mode. In this gameplay video, you can see all the different types of moves, team cross-ups, and tricks you can pull on your enemies to score a hit. \n\nComing to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch on May 21st, Knockout City is shaping up to be a fun and accessible take on classic multiplayer combat. We'll have more on Knockout City coming up as we approach its launch in the months ahead.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hckauYFPYQ", "date_published": "2021-02-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mario Golf Super Rush | Nintendo Direct", "description": "A little birdie told us Mario Golf is coming to Nintendo Switch for a brand new tournament!
