It has a looper per channel, can be influenced by CV input to transpose any channel or all of them, and has a chaos input that will scramble the parameters for each channel based on a customizable entropy amount. It's as wild as you want it to be. Let's check it out. https://www.clank.eu/chaos\nNo-talking demo performances: https://youtu.be/Uh4pZ3KcqlE\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching. My name is Jeremy, and this is Red Means Recording. I've been making music for a few decades now, and this channel is a place to make music and to talk about the tools and techniques to make music with. We'll use synths, drum machines, modular gear, and software. \n\nIf you'd like to support the channel, I have a Patreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nI have music as \"Jeremy Blake\" on all the major services: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nI have some merch here: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nAnd you can connect with me here: \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzaNlou6vp4", "date_published": "2021-02-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
