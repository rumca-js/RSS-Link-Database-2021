Michel Fortin used to be known to be as "The Copy Doctor". He ran a copywriters board of tens of thousands of people... but he shut it all down. 

Why? He realized the industry had become unethical and could no longer be  apart of it.  He's lost friends over this, but says ethics are far more important. 

He now does SEO and you can find him at his blog: https://michelfortin.com/

NOTE: this episode was filmed back in Oct/Nov and it just took a while to get out, that's why the background is different.

this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.
