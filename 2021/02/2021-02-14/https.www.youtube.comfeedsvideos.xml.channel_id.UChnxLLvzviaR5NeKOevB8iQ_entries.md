Chaos by Clank is a 6 channel random gate and voltage generator that can be constrained to all sorts of musical timings and scales. It has a looper per channel, can be influenced by CV input to transpose any channel or all of them, and has a chaos input that will scramble the parameters for each channel based on a customizable entropy amount. It's as wild as you want it to be. Let's check it out. https://www.clank.eu/chaos
