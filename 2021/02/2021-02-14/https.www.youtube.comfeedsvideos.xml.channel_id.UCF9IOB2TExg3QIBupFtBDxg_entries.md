Safety and immune responses in children and young adults

Ages, 6 to 17 years

Single-blind, randomised phase II trial

N =  300 volunteers

Vaccine group, n = 240

Control group, n = 60, meningitis vaccine

Safe and gives a sore arm

Andrew Pollard

Professor of Paediatric Infection and Immunity, and Chief Investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial

While most children are relatively unaffected by coronavirus and are unlikely to become unwell with the infection, 

it is important to establish the safety and immune response to the vaccine in children and young people as some children may benefit from vaccination. 

These new trials will extend our understanding of control of SARS-CoV2 to younger age groups

Starting trials for younger children this spring

Pfizer

Moderna

Janssen
