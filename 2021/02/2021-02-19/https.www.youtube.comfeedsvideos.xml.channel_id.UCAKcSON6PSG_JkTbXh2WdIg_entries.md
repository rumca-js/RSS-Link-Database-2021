Two years ago this week, the Cactus Blossoms visited The Current studio to play songs from their then-forthcoming record, "Easy Way." The band certainly didn't take the easy way when making the album. "This time around, we produced it ourselves and went down that rabbit hole," the Cactus Blossoms' Jack Torrey told Bill DeVille. "Now that it's done; we're really glad. It took us a while to make it."

Watch two songs from "Easy Way" — and as an added bonus, enjoy "Powder Blue" from the Cactus Blossoms' studio session from February 2016.

## Regina Spektor   three live performances 2017

Happy birthday to Regina Spektor, born February 18 in Moscow. Spektor moved to the United States as a grade-schooler. "I came here with refugee status and as an immigrant," she told The Current's Jim McGuinn in 2017, "so then you become part of this immigrant-refugee community, and you love America in this way that is different. There's a certain kind of way that a puppy that was born into a family loves the family, and there's a different way that a dog that's been sheltered and got rescued from the pound loves the family. I always feel like that — where I feel so much love and such a desire to protect the ideals of America."

Regina Spektor visited our studio that year to perform a set of songs, including music from her 2016 album, "Remember Us Into Life." That same year, Spektor performed on the American Public Media program "Live From Here," in an episode recorded live at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle. Watch Regina Spektor's performances from that show.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Older and Taller"
3:32 "Samson"
6:42 "The Trapper and the Furrier"

PERSONNEL
Regina Spektor – piano and vocals
Chris Thile – mandolin (on "Older and Taller")
