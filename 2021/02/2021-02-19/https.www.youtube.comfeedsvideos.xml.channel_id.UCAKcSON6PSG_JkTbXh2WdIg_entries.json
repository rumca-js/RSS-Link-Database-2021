Spektor moved to the United States as a grade-schooler. \"I came here with refugee status and as an immigrant,\" she told The Current's Jim McGuinn in 2017, \"so then you become part of this immigrant-refugee community, and you love America in this way that is different. There's a certain kind of way that a puppy that was born into a family loves the family, and there's a different way that a dog that's been sheltered and got rescued from the pound loves the family. I always feel like that \u2014 where I feel so much love and such a desire to protect the ideals of America.\"\n\nRegina Spektor visited our studio that year to perform a set of songs, including music from her 2016 album, \"Remember Us Into Life.\" That same year, Spektor performed on the American Public Media program \"Live From Here,\" in an episode recorded live at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle.
