Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States

California, 7 February 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.06.21251159v1

B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, has gained a strong foothold across the world

Detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere

Doubling rate of a little over a week

Increased transmission rate of 35-45%

Several independent introductions

From late November 2020

Onward community transmission, 40 states

U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant

Requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality

B117 is becoming dominant in Florida

https://www.wits.ac.za/covid19/covid19-news/latest/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trial-results.html

One million doses arrived

Minimal protection against SA variant

Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, rollout paused

Variant became dominant in November

No significant protection against illness, but all the cases of disease were mild or moderate

Vaccinated people will probably still allow ongoing transmission

As has been recently reported in those with prior infection

The study

Witwatersrand and Oxford

N = 2,000

Examined adults between 18 and 64

Seven sites in South Africa

Last summer and fall

B.1.351 (92% of all current cases in SA)

Eeek mutation, E484K

E = Glutamate

K = Lysine

N501Y as well

Three US states, Virginia

SA variant in the UK

https://news.sky.com/story/uk-covid-news-latest-updates-on-coronavirus-lockdown-and-vaccine-12212131

Cases, 147


Vaccine group

19 cases of covid-19 caused by the variant

Mild disease was defined as at least one symptom of COVID-19


Placebo group

20 cases

Suggests 10% effective

Or 22%

Participants in the trial were young and healthy

Median age 31

Therefore, severe disease protection unknown

Novavax and Johnson & Johnson, 50 to 60%

Janssen, (J and J) protected against moderate to severe disease

Might need to move from hoped for herd immunity to individual severe disease protection

Vaccine after effects

February 4, 2021

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-vaccine-pfizer-effects


Likelihood of experience one or more mild systemic after effects

N = 280,000

From a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dose

Data comes from a sub-sample, n = 40,000

Largest study group outside of trials

Up to 4th January, many HCWs

Not previously infected, 19%

Previously infected, 33%

Systemic after effects, Pfizer/BioNTech

Fatigue 9%

Headache 8%

Chills or shivers 4%

Most mild systemic after effects appeared in the first two days

Only 3% of people have any after effects beyond three days

Local effects, pain or swelling

After the first dose, 37%

After the second dose, 45%

At least one systemic effect (within 7 days)

After the first dose, 14%

After the second dose, 22%

Men, 13%

Women, 19%

Under 55s, 21%

Over 55s, 14%

Same study, vaccine hesitancy

Over one million app users

Yes, 95% 

Unsure or unwilling, 5%

Main three reasons given by hesitant contributors

Long term side effects, 50.2%

Lack of knowledge, 37.2%

Concerns about potential adverse reactions, 30.9%

## New variant, same symptoms

No evidence for changes in symptoms from UK variant

1.76 million users between 28th September and 27th December 2020

Using longitudinal symptom and test reports, n = 36,920

Northern Ireland, unknown

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/no-evidence-for-changes-in-symptoms-from-new-coronavirus-variant

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.21250680v1

First identified in December 2020 in the south east of England

Studied association between the regional proportion of B.1.1.7 and reported symptoms, disease course, rates of reinfection, and transmissibility 

Disease severity

No evidence of an association between B.1.1.7 and number of symptoms reported

No evidence of increased number of hospitalisations

Counter evidence

SAGE meeting paper, 21st January 

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/955239/NERVTAG_paper_on_variant_of_concern__VOC__B.1.1.7.pdf

There is a realistic possibility that VOC B.1.1.7 is associated with an increased risk of death compared to non-VOC viruses. 

Disease duration

No evidence for change

Reported symptoms

No difference in symptoms reported

No difference in symptom duration

No difference in proportion of asymptomatic case 


Claire Steves on symptoms

It’s important to emphasise the range of symptoms both the new and the old variant can cause, 

such as headaches and sore throat, 

in addition to the classic triad of cough, fever and loss of smell

Likely reinfection rate

Positive tests results from 36,509

304 reported two positive tests more than 90 days apart, 249 identified as reinfection

No difference in reinfection reporting rates across the different NHS regions

Around 0.7%

95% CI 0.6-0.8

No evidence that this was higher compared to older strains

Tim Spector on reinfection

It’s reassuring that reinfections are still really rare many months after previous infection, suggesting that both natural immunity and vaccines will be effective against this new strain

Increase in R(t)

By a factor of 1.35 

Regional and national lockdowns have reduced R(t) below 1 in regions with very high proportions of B.1.1.7

Tim Spector

This research highlights the unique value of the ZOE app in understanding the impact of new coronavirus variants across the population in a matter of weeks,

and we need our app users to help us maintain vigilance against further new strains as they emerge


SA VOC in UK

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55967767

About 100 cases in the UK

Oxford A/A vaccine offers limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by SA variant

AstraZeneca, not yet been able to properly establish if prevention of severe disease and hospitalisation

Current data mostly from young and healthy adults

AZ confident it will protect against serious cases

Similar neutralising antibodies still work


Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine

Working on a new vaccine designed to combat the South African variant

This year we expect to show that the new version of the vaccine will generate antibodies that recognise the new variant

It looks very much like it will be available for the autumn

We're already working on the first part of the manufacturing process in Oxford

that will be passed on to other members of the manufacturing supply chain as we go through the spring


Onset of protection

200,000 reports from vaccinated people

After 12 days, 53% reduction in new cases compared to non-vaccinated controls

First post trial data the vaccines are working after first shot

No protection at all for first 12 days

Toon, Netherlands

Spread of new variants

UK, SA, two Brazilian variants

UK variant, (Pathogenic Surveillance)

https://www.rivm.nl/en/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/research/pathogen-surveillance

Week of 11th to 17th January, 19.8% UK variant

Week of 27 January to 2 February, about two-thirds

South Africa variant

Found 23 times

Most had epidemiological links

Brazilian variants

P1 variant, 2 people who recently visited Brazil

P2 variant, 3 people, two with no travel history

Reproduction number on 15th January

Below 1 overall

Old variant, 0.86

UK variant, 1.28

It can therefore be deduced that the UK variant is more contagious


Current restrictions

https://www.rivm.nl/en/news/new-variants-disrupt-plans (Dutch CDC)

Lockdown and curfew

CDC, loosen measures now, hospitals are at risk of being overrun by March
