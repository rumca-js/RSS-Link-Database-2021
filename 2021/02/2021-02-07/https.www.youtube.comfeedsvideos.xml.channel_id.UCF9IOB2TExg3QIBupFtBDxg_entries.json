CI 0.6-0.8\n\nNo evidence that this was higher compared to older strains\n\nTim Spector on reinfection\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring that reinfections are still really rare many months after previous infection, suggesting that both natural immunity and vaccines will be effective against this new strain\n\nIncrease in R(t)\n\nBy a factor of 1.35 \n\nRegional and national lockdowns have reduced R(t)
