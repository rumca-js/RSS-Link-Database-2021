Tom Fox sampled a Janet Jackson song for the intro of this video, and then made all the music for the rest of the video. He's really good and can make music for your videos too: https://tfbeats.com/

Big shout out to Shannon Holland, who originally analyzed all the news articles on this matter. Her work on this guided my analysis big time. Go read her study: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07491409.2009.10162384
