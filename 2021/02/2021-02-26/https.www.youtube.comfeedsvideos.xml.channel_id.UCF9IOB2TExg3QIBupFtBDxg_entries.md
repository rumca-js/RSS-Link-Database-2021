Professor Calum Semple, (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies)

Primary school children are the lowest risk both to themselves and to society

Children are half to a third as likely to acquire the virus

When it comes to transmitting they are probably half as likely to transmit it as adults

That risk actually gets smaller as you go into younger age groups

I am not a great fan of young children wearing face masks

If I had to invest in a single activity to improve the environment both for the children and the adults, I'd be looking at improving the ventilation, 

unsealing windows that have been painted shut and kept shut for energy-saving reasons

That would be a much more effective way to reduce transmission in schools
