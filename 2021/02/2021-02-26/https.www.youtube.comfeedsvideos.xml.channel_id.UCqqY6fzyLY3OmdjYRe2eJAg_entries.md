LYRICS

been on the run
to feel you
wandered far and wide
cause you are the sun
i need to
lit the fire inside

and forevermore
you know i'm
longing to be near
like never before
gonna show you
there's nothing left to fear

gonna keep you
closer to my heart in this time
keep you
closer to my heart in this time

down by the lake
i saw you
you've been running away
from all that we had
i'd call you
someone's going astray

and forevermore
you know i'm
longing to be near
like never before
gonna show you
there's nothing left to fear

gonna keep you
closer to my heart in this time
keep you
closer to my heart in this time
gonna keep you
closer to my heart in this time
keep you
closer to my heart in this time

memories start fading out
but the night has just begun
how long have i been waiting now
ain't it right

gonna keep you
closer to my heart in this time
keep you
closer to my heart in this time
gonna keep you
closer to my heart in this time
keep you
closer to my heart in this time

LYRICS

with every move you make
you feel it again
there's no coming out 
but you keep fighting it all till the end

with every chance you take
again and again
you're starting to shout
but you keep holding on till the end

oohh
yeah now you keep pushing
no there's no easy way out
oohh
no need to keep pushing
no there's no easy way out

you're losing track of time
your feet off the ground
it's all in your head
but you keep running away from yourself

just give me a warning sign
no one to be found
you're starting to break
but you keep looking for somebody else

oohh
yeah now you keep pushing
no there's no easy way out
oohh
no need to keep pushing
no there's no easy way out

it's coming to get you now
no way to pretend
i just wanna take the bow
can't wait till the end

with all of the road you take
it hits you again
your skin begins to shake
so stop to defend

LYRICS

lost in a moment
try to immerse
longing for romance
for better or worse

yeah you were the symptom
i was the cause
just trying to look back on
all that i was

now that i know
i'll forget
all that you said

trying to let go
and forget
all that we had

the moon is still out there
high up above
i know that you're somewhere
looking for love

yeah you were the symptom
i was the cause
just trying to look back on
all that i was

now that i know
i'll forget
all that you said

trying to let go
and forget
all that we had
all that we've been through
no time for regret
but still coming back to 
the day that we met

yeah you were the symptom
i was the cause
just trying to look back on
all that i was

now that i know
i'll forget
all that you said

trying to let go
and forget
all that we had

now that i know
i'll forget
all that you said

trying to let go
and forget
all that we had

LYRICS

Don't you fall into despair 
I got your back this time 
Tell me when you're coming home 
 
Don't you see how much I care 
Just let the stars align 
No i can't face the storm alone 
 
Hold on 
Never let go 
We're higher than we ever been 
Can't you 
Feel how we grow 
 
So won't you tell me
When will I see you
When will I see you again
 
Now that I'm ready 
When will I see you  
When will I see you again 
 
Don't you leave without a trace
I got my eyes on you 
You've been off for way too long 
 
You will leave an empty space 
Into the sky of blue 
Just to help yourself along 
 
Hold on 
Never let go 
We're higher than we ever been 
Can't you 
Feel how we grow 
 
So won't you tell me
When will I see you
When will I see you again
Now that I'm ready 
When will I see you
When will I see you again  
 
For so long I've been  
Waiting for your love 
Keep longing for the time 
For so long I’ve been 
Aching for your love 
Keep longing for the time 
 
So won't you tell me 
When will I see you 
When will I see you again 
Now that I’m ready 
When will I see you
When will I see you again
