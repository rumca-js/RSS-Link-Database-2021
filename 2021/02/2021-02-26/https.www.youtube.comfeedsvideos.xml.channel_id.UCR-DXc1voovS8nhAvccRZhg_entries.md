Finally, with a bit of help from some Broadcom engineers, I got full hardware RAID working on a Raspberry Pi. And I actually used SAS drives this time.

Special thanks to Broadcom for sending me a controller card and storage backplane to test on the Pi, and for their help in debugging the driver issues!
