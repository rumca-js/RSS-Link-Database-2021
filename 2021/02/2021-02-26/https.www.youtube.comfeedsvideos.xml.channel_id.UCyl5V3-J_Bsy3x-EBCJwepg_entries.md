Kyle and Ethan from The Babylon Bee Podcast are joined by Kristin Oren who has served as a tireless writer, headline generator, and copy editor for The Babylon Bee. They talk about new Disney Plus show content warnings you should know about, read weird news and hate mail, and meditate upon the spiritual lessons to be gleaned from competitive Russian slap fighting. Kyle and Ethan also talk to Amanda Hope Haley about her new book, The Red-Haired Archaeologist Digs Israel, and how archaeology can help us better understand Bible times.
