And I actually used SAS drives this time.\n\nSpecial thanks to Broadcom for sending me a controller card and storage backplane to test on the Pi, and for their help in debugging the driver issues!\n\nBlog post that goes with this video: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/hardware-raid-on-raspberry-pi-cm4\n\nProducts mentioned in this video (some links are affiliate links):\n\n  - Broadcom MegaRAID 9460-16i: https://amzn.to/2PecbN1\n  - Broadcom MegaRAID 9440-8i: https://amzn.to/2P3lWgQ\n  - Kingston SA400 SSD: https://amzn.to/3ks4vCf\n  - HP 300GB 10K Proliant SAS: https://amzn.to/3ks4xtR\n  - 12V 2A power adapter: https://amzn.to/2P2UrnA\n  - 12V 5A power adapter: https://amzn.to/3aTs9og\n\nOther videos mentioned in this video:\n\n  - Enterprise SAS RAID on a Pi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gAUApGaWKk\n  - The Fastest SATA RAID NAS on the Pi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWev1THtA04\n\nMore info on PCIe cards I'm testing: https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\n\n#RaspberryPi #RAID #ComputeModule4\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:02 - What is SAS RAID?\n03:37 - Why RAID on a Pi?\n05:22 - MegaRAID 9460-16i overview\n07:16 - Making it work on the Pi\n11:00 - Creating RAID volumes with StorCLI\n12:58 - Performance\n15:48 - 2.5 Gbps NAS?\n16:59 - Recommendations and alternatives\n18:02 - Bloopers", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zpfq8ZC2hyI", "date_published": "2021-02-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
