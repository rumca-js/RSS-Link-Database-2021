-----------------------
In 1927, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates from 4% to 3.5%. When interest rates go lower, it becomes easier for people and businesses to borrow money. When you spend money, someone else earns more money. The people you spend your money on also get richer. And the richer that person gets, the easier it is for him to get a bigger loan. And this process continues throughout the entire country until the whole economy is booming.

By 1928, the Fed was finally starting to see how troubling all this speculative debt was, so they raised interest rates from the 3.5% that set this bubble in motion, to 5%.

March 1929: the Fed daily secret meetings, but didn’t tell the public what the meetings were about. Fed raises rates again from 5% to 6%. And just like how the Fed lowering rates made people borrow more which cascaded into the market soaring - the Fed raising rates had the opposite effect. October 19, 1929: The Stock Market Crashes.

By New Year’s Day of 1930, the stock market crashed around 50%. Banks started failing left and right, with nearly a thousand banks failing in 1930 alone.

1931: Six million people are out of a job in the US.That cycle downward continues, and as money and credit contracts, the economy starts to really fall off a cliff.

1932: Congress passes the 1932 Banking Act, allowing the Federal Reserve to “print money” - 75 years later we would call this “quantitative easing” - along with even more powers.

After the housing market crash of 2008, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near 0%. Because just like how the Fed lowering rates in the early 1920’s allowed people to borrow more, and spend more, which made incomes go up and the overall economy spiral up. 

By the start of 2020, the market was reaching a boiling point after 131 months of expansion. And then boom - the market crashes by 25%.
