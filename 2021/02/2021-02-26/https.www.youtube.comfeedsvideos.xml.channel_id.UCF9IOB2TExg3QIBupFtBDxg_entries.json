children wearing face masks\n\nIf I had to invest in a single activity to improve the environment both for the children and the adults, I'd be looking at improving the ventilation, \n\nunsealing windows that have been painted shut and kept shut for energy-saving reasons\n\nThat would be a much more effective way to reduce transmission in schools\n\nGP LD register\n\nJoint Committee on
