I finally have a chance to try out a Pimax VR headset long term. Here are my in depth thoughts after using the Pimax 5k Super as a hardcore Valve Index user. So far I actually have really been enjoying the headset.. but not gonna lie its a very weird package.. probably the weirdest VR package I have used to date.
