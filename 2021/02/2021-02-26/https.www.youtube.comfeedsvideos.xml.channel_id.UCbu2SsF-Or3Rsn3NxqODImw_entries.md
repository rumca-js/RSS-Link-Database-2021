Pokemon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl have officially been revealed! To celebrate we go back and compare the newly revealed footage in the trailers to the original Diamond & Pearl gameplay in this side by side comparison video!

Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are almost 15 years old, having originally launched for Nintendo DS in September 2006 in Japan. The games were released four years after the previous entry, Pokemon Ruby & Sapphire, and we wouldn’t get the next generation, Pokemon Black and White, for another four years. Instead, we indulged in some Pokemon nostalgia with games like Pokemon HeartGold & Soulsilver--so it wasn’t completely empty.

Now, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are inviting us to take a trip down memory lane again with Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, which are remakes of the classic DS titles. This gives us the perfect excuse to put both versions of the two games side-by-side to see just how far we've come.

As you might have guessed the DS and Switch versions don’t look similar at all. The Switch version went with a chibi art-style the harcons back to the little sprites on the DS, but otherwise everything is shiny and new including the battles between Pokemon.

Pokemon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl will be released in Late 2021 on Nintendo Switch. The Pokemon Company also revealed Pokemon Legends: Arceus, a brand new open-world Pokemon title that seems to have some similarities to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Pokemon Legends: Arceus will be released in Early 2022 for the Nintendo Switch.

See the differences between the current gen and previous gen versions of Outriders' prologue.

The demo for Outriders is now out, allowing you to play through the opening hours of developer People Can Fly's upcoming multiplayer-focused action RPG. You can play the demo on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC--the only system that doesn't support the demo but will play the game at launch is Stadia.

In the video above, we do a side-by-side comparison of the Outriders demo, playing it both on PS4 and PS5. We take a look at how well the game performs on the two systems, both in terms of graphical quality and loading times.

In Outriders, you play as an Outrider, a specialized combat scout charged with leading humanity's exploration across a new world after the destruction of Earth. Mutated by a freakish storm upon your arrival, you become an Altered--someone who can bend the elements to their will. You have the choice of commanding earth, fire, time, or technology. 

The demo for Outriders covers the opening chapter, which includes several campaign missions and optional side quests. Your progress in the demo will transfer over to the full game once it launches on April 1. Like that version, the Outriders' demo supports co-op, allowing you to team up with other players in three-person squads.
