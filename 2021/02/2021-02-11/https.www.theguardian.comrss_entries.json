The woman is talking about Spears\u2019 conservatorship, an elaborate legal arrangement, in place since 2009, in which the singer has been declared unfit to manage her own affairs. The conservatorship means that Spears\u2019 life \u2013 and her money \u2013 are largely under the control of her father, Jamie Spears, who has been appointed conservator by the court. That arrangement has come under scrutiny as fans speculate that Spears\u2019 independence has been needlessly curtailed by a greedy father and a misogynist court system, and that the singer has been trapped in a literal, court-ordained patriarchy. Spears herself has petitioned for the court appoint a different conservator, saying that she is afraid of her father.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/26/the-time-has-come-im-joining-team-freebritney-heres-why-you-should-too\">The time has come \u2013 I\u2019m joining team #FreeBritney.
