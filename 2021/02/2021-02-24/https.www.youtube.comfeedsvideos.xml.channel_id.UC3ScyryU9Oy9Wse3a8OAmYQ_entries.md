“Two American Families” raises questions about the U.S. economy and the declining middle class through the stories of the Neumanns and the Stanleys, which began when the breadwinners in both families lost their well-paying factory jobs. For more than two decades, Correspondent Bill Moyers documented their struggle to keep their homes, their health insurance and their dignity.
