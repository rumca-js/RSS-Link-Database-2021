Five years ago this week, the Pines performed a set in our studio for The Local Show. The Pines are co-fronted by singer-songwriter David Huckfelt, who recently released his solo album, "Room Enough, Time Enough"; singles from that album, such as "Stranger Angels" and "Bury Me Not (The Dying Cowboy)," have been airing on The Current. But for this session highlight, we turn back the clock to 2016 for these two songs by the Pines.

## Listen to Looch: a close look at visual artist Jean-Michel Basquiat

The 2010 documentary, "Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child," is now available for streaming on several platforms. The documentary, directed by Tamra Davis and released by Arthouse Films/Cinedigm, covers the life of the New York visual artist who, it has been said, had an audience that "wasn't born yet."

"This film is amazing," Mary says. "Through interviews through watching him paint, listening to jazz — to bebop, specifically — you get such a close look into one of my favorite artists in the world."
