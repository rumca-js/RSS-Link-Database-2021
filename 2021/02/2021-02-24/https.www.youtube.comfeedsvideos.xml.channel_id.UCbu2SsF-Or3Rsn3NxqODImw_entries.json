Here's how escort and high-value target objectives work.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Warzone are entering Season 2 with a new battle pass that focuses on zombies. Based on recent trailers, zombies are expected to invade both the Dirty Bomb maps and Warzone. Currently, in Warzone, the developers are building unanswered mysteries such as a dark ship approaching the shore, and an inactive Trail Computer from Zombies has been found.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to take on the newly released Outbreak mode which involves fighting the undead on a much larger scale than previous maps Die Maschine and Firebase Z. The new experience places squads of four in free-roam environments where they will take part in objective-based modes such as defend, escort, retrieve, eliminate, and holdout. Even though the maps are open to explore, players will still be able to extract or continue after each phase. Familiar staples such as the Crafting Table, support items, armor, and weapon upgrade machines, Pack-a-Punch, and Perk vending machines will all be present. Rewards for Outbreak include the new Refined and Flawless Aetherium Crystals, allowing players to upgrade skills to tier four and five. The previous cap was three. Zombies modes also typically involve secret areas, mysteries to solve, and Wonder Weapons. Over on Call Of Duty\u2019s battle royale map, we still don\u2019t know what is going to happen with the season pass listing Warzone\u2019s event as \u201cA dark wave approaches Verdansk.\u201d Join us to find out.\n\nCall Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and free-to-play Warzone are available for PS4 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Cold War Season 2 releases on February 25th.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gn162sto0o", "date_published": "2021-02-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Escape From Tarkov Complete Raid Series", "description": "Find all your links and connections for Escape From Tarkov and Battlestate Games here! \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bstategames \nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/battlestategames \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QGploHhl9_XaxDiHZKamg \nGame Information and Store: https://www.escapefromtarkov.com \n\nBattlestate games officially dropped the final episode of their Raid Cinematic series.

The game was released five years after the last home console entry, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and we wouldn\u2019t get the next home console release, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for almost six years--though we did get some other Zelda games along the way like A Link Between Worlds, so it wasn\u2019t completely empty.\n\nThe Wii is an SD console with games outputting at 480p, so despite the PS3 and Xbox 360 being around and HD being a thing in 2011, Skyward Sword was only ever seen in SD before now. You\u2019ll also notice in this comparison video that the Switch version is running a lot more smoothly in comparison to the original Wii version. On Wii, Skyward Sword runs at 30fps while the Switch version looks to be running at 60fps.\u00a0\n\nThe Wind Waker and Twilight Princess both got the HD treatment back on Wii U, so it was only a matter of time for Skyward Sword to get the same treatment. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD releases on Nintendo Switch on July 16 with newly added button controls as the original version only had motion controls.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxZTQ4CKa1k", "date_published": "2021-02-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
