The M1 SoC released in the M1 Mac mini, M1 MacBook Pro, and M1 MacBook Air is impressive. The chip is insanely efficient and has rather excellent performance\u2014objectively\u2014not just for a low-TDP chip. But how does it compare to something like a Ryzen 4750G APU. Or what about a top-of-the-line laptop CPU like the 5900HX? We benchmark both machines and demonstrate how Apple Silicon's power efficiency just can't be matched and how that might affect the high-performance of an upcoming M2 or M1X later this year.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5bAMoQt7EQ", "date_published": "2021-02-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
