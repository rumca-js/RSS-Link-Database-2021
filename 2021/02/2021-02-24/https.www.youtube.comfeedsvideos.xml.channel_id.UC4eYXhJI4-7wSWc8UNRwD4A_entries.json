We hope you enjoy.\n\nBobby Carter | February 25, 2021\nKirk Franklin, set up with his band and choir in a corner of Uncle Jessie's Kitchen, makes a declaration. \"I know you're at home right now, in your draws, listening to some Jesus music. It's ok. Jesus loves you in your draws!\" The Arlington, Texas studio, named after a long time close friend, features a large photo of the iconic \"I AM A MAN\" protest signs from the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike on the wall. The jubilant energy that Franklin and company emit, juxtaposed with a visual reminder of the strife that Black people have endured is illustrative of the importance of gospel music in the Black community.\n\nFor nearly 30 years, Franklin has been widely regarded for revolutionizing gospel. He incorporated secular music, particularly hip-hop, while preserving the message and integrity of traditional gospel. Here, he and his powerhouse choir pace through a decades-long, sixteen Grammy award winning discography of faith, praise and encouragement while cracking plenty of jokes. I cannot recall a more moving Tiny Desk home performance.\n\nAll month long, we've presented artists that speak to the diversity and complexity of Black music--where we've been, where we are and where we're going. For the final show, we take it back to the spiritual roots and there's no one more fitting to cap things off than Mr. Kirk Franklin.\n\nSET LIST\nLove Theory \nSilver and Gold\nMelodies From Heaven \nI Smile\n\nMUSICIANS\nKirk Franklin: vocals, keys\nMelodie Pace: vocals\nDarian Elliot: vocals\nMichael Bethany: vocals\nEboni Ellerson: vocals\nDeon Yancey: vocals\nTia Rudd: vocals\nShaun Martin: keyboard\nMatthew Ramsey: bass\nTerry Baker: drums, percussion\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Clear Scope Media\nAudio: Michael Havens Reese Brooks\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nArt Director: CJ Riculan\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #kirkfranklin #gospel #tinydesk", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRwId2RfmfA", "date_published": "2021-02-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Davido: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week.

He and his band create a sultry vibe with a unique rendition of \"Gobe,\" his smash 2013 single, to open the set.\n\nDavido has long expressed pride in his father's success. He titled his 2012 debut album Omo Baba Olowo, meaning \"son of a rich man\" in the Yoruba language. In his (home) concert, Davido cites his father as his inspiration in a sweet and tender moment: \"A Nigerian American like myself that studied in the States...I went to an HBCU, you know... My dad went to one as well and my dad used to work at Burger King. ... To become what he's become today as a Black man starting off in America has been very, very inspiring to me.\"\n\nIn collaboration with the Alternate Sound band, Davido strips back \"Aye,\" a hit from 2014, with an unfettered rendition showcasing his natural voice devoid of any vocal effects. And the result sounds fantastic.\n\nLike all touring artists, the pandemic forced Davido to spend extended time at his home instead of traveling the world. The last year allowed him to re-center himself in his motherland and inspired his 2020 release, A Better Time. Rounding out this Tiny Desk (home) concert, he concludes with \"Jowo,\" a single from the album that of conjures hope for better times ahead.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Gobe\"\n\"Aye\"\n\"Risky\"\n\"Jowo\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nDavido: vocals\nGospel Obi: keyboard\nStanley Unogu: drums\nKenneth Ogueji: bass\nOrowo \"Roy\" Ubiene: keys\nBassey Kenneth: vocals\nSylvia Asuquo: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Legacy Films\nAudio: Kelvin Pro Audio\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nArt Director: CJ Riculan\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSS4FiOY8P0", "date_published": "2021-02-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
