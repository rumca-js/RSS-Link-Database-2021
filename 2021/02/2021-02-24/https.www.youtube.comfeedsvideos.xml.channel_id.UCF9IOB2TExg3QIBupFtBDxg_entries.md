BNT162b2 mRNA

Vaccine effectiveness in healthcare worker

Prospective cohort study of staff undergoing regular asymptomatic testing.

The SIREN study

N = 29,378

2 weekly intervals

Records symptoms, PCR and antibody test results

Therefore symptomatic and asymptomatic infections

Hazard ratios to compare time

Infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated groups


Findings, 5th February 2021

People who were antibody negative on recruitment

A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, effectiveness of 72%

21 days after first dose

Rising to 86% seven days after two doses

Conclusion

Vaccine effectively prevents both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working age adults

Cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B1.1.7

Consistent data

Israel, Norwich Medical School 

Pfizer COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine, after a single dose, ‘real-world’

At day 21

Vaccine effectiveness, 91%

After day 21

Remained at 90%

Expected to last form 9 weeks to 6 months

Vaccine effectiveness seems to be better at reducing severe disease that at reducing mild disease

Public health Scotland

Fourth week after first dose, reduced risk of hospitalisation

Pfizer, down 84% (n = 650,000) 

Oxford-AstraZeneca, down 94% (n = 490,000)

Combined reduction in over 80s

Vaccination associated with 81% reduction in hospitalisation risk in the fourth week

Prioritizing its nuclear weapons program over the needs of its people

longstanding, systematic, widespread and gross violations of human rights, serious threat, to international security

isolation from the international community is inevitably worsening the impacts of the pandemic on the North Korean population

The health care system is very weak. 

They don't want to show that to the world. 

North Korea is a museum of viruses
