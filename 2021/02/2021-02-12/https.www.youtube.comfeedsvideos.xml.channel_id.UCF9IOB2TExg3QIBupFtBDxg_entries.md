Effect of calcifediol treatment and best available therapy versus best available therapy on intensive care unit admission and mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19: A pilot randomized clinical study (October 2020)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456194/

n = 76, Calcifediol treatment

50 patients treated with calcifediol

One required admission to ICU (2%)

No deaths

and mortality

N = 930

Randomly assigned

Calcifediol treatment group n = 551

Day one, 532 ug (21,000 iu)

Days, 3, 7, 15, 30, 266 ug (10,640 iu)

No adverse effects reported

Required ICU, 30 (5.4%) 

Deaths, 36 (6.5%)

Death RR = 0.36

64% reduced chance of death

Control group n = 379

Required ICU, 80 (21.1%), p less than 0.0001

Deaths, 57 (15%), p = 0.001

Interpretation

In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, calcifediol treatment at the time of hospitalization significantly reduced ICU admission and mortality.

Early calcifediol after admission

Prior to ARDS development, is critical for mortality reduction

Initiation of calcifediol during ICU admission did not modify patient survival

Vitamin D into the body

D3 (cholecalciferol), sun, animals or supplement 

D2 (ergocalciferol), plants, supplements

Pathway

In the skin

Vitamin D, cholecalciferol, synthesised in the skin

In the liver

Converted to its major circulating form, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)

Calcifediol 

In the kidneys

Converted into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, or calcitriol, the principal active hormonal form of vitamin D 

Vitamin D in the blood

25 hydroxy vitamin D

25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)

Calcifediol 

Circulating concentration of 25OHD is the accepted biomarker for vitamin D status

Many experts recommend a level between 20 and 40 ng/mL (50 to 100 nmol/L)

Others recommend a level between 30 and 50 ng/mL (75 to 125 nmol/L)

Some say higher

How much to take in Winter?

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/

Do not take more than 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) of vitamin D a day (11 years to adults)

Children aged 1 to 10 years should not have more than 50 micrograms (2,000 IU) a day. 

Infants under 12 months should not have more than 25 micrograms (1,000 IU) a day.
