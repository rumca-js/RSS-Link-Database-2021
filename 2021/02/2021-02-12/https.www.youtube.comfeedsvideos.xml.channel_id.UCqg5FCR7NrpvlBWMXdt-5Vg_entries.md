It’s interesting to take a look at games after we’ve moved past the opening bubble of release. To set aside the mass dump of embargoed reviews, Twitter hot takes, and YouTube reaction videos riding the waves of trends and controversies. Once the dust of discourse has settled, you sometimes see a game in a completely different light. You also begin to see how the game might age. In the case of Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding, a bit of distance might have been just what was needed to see the game for exactly what it is — a massive, shaggy mess of a story, filled with strange and sometimes-alienating gameplay quirks, which all congeals into an experience that is somehow aging better than any game in recent memory.
