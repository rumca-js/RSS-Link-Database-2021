<p>Aristotle, in his <em>Physics</em> argued that there are four causes behind
everything that exists. These causes answer the question of &quot;How&quot; or
&quot;Why&quot; something is the way it is.</p>
<dl>
<dt>The Material Cause</dt>
<dd>The material from which something is made. E.g. the stone of a
statue.</dd>
<dt>The Efficient Cause</dt>
<dd>The external force that causes something to be made. E.g. the
artisan and his tools who make a statue.</dd>
<dt>The Formal Cause</dt>
<dd>The form or plan of the thing made that define it. E.g. the
artisan's written or thought blueprints or sketch of plans for how
to make the statue.</dd>
<dt>The Final Cause</dt>
<dd>The goal and reason of the thing. E.g. the purpose for which the
artisan is making the statue.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the statue lacks any one of the four causes, it will not be made.</p>
<h2 id="the-demise-of-the-formal-and-final-causes">The Demise of the Formal and Final Causes</h2>
<p>If you want to point your finger at a single philosophical change that
defines the shift from the Aristotelean worldview of antiquity and the
Middle Ages to the materialism of modernity, it is the rejection of the
Formal and Final Causes in the early Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Just ask your modern brain: &quot;Does everything <em>really</em> have a purpose?&quot;
You will probably reflexively think back &quot;No,&quot; therefore, you do not
believe in a Final Cause to everything. The same is true of the Formal
Cause, both of them seeming to assume that there is a kind of conscious
agency behind the action. That isn't strictly speaking how Aristotle
intended them, but that's how they are interpreted through modern
goggles.</p>
<p>You can see their rejection as early as the 1600's: Francis Bacon in
<em>Novum Organum</em> pushed aside the Final Cause as only being only suitable
for inter-human behavior. The Formal Cause, he dismissed merely as
<em>desperata</em> &quot;hopeless.&quot; He actually dismissed the vocabulary of the
other two causes as being superficial and an irrelevant distinction too,
but philosophically, they are still retained in his philosophy by other
terms.</p>
<p>In any case, modern people do not believe in Final and Formal Causes, or
if they do, not for everything in the cosmos. For Aquinas and others in
the Aristotelean world, the question of whether the universe has a
purpose or a formal plan is a kind of tautology. Of course it does!
Everything non-random does in Aristotelianism.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-cause-in-nature">The Final Cause in Nature?</h2>
<p>Now our post-materialist view of the Final Cause is sort of different
from Aristotle's original view. We have to remember that Aristotle
viewed grammar and cognition as something that in some way was directly
reflective of reality itself. Compare this view shared with the
so-called &quot;Speculative Grammarians&quot; of the Middle Ages,
&quot;speculative&quot; coming from the Latin word <em>speculum</em> &quot;mirror&quot;, since
grammar reflects reality. This common strand stretches from Aristotle to
those influenced by his work like Priscian and Bacon (Roger (who was
based), not Francis (who was p. cringe)).</p>
<p>Nowadays we atomize questions like &quot;Why&quot; to the point that even
causality itself doesn't mean anything and is a mere human cognitive
convention, but for Aristotle, the linguistic existence of &quot;Why&quot;
questions means that there is a legitimate logical equivalent to &quot;Why&quot;
in reality.</p>
<p>Aristotle originally had argued that it is appropriate to refer to the
Final Cause of something whenever it is not due to randomness or
spontaneity. The example he uses is the growth of human teeth: there is
no variance in where the molar and incisors grow within the human mouth.
Everything appears where it's &quot;supposed to&quot; and we can assume that
there is some kind of Final Cause behind this.</p>
<p>If different shapes and sizes teeth grew in different locations of the
mouth, then it would be appropriate to talk of them as lacking a Final
Cause. Things that appear randomly and inconsistently do not necessarily
have Final Causes, but if something happens invariably, we can trust
that it has a Final Cause.</p>
<h2 id="darwin-got-it-wrong-too">Darwin &quot;Got It Wrong&quot; too?</h2>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/wdgw.jpg" /></figure>

<p>So how far are moderns willing to take the rejection of the Formal and
Final Causes?</p>
<p>One of my old Ph.D. advisors, Massimo Piatelli-Palmarini wrote a book
with Jerry Fodor called <em>What Darwin Got Wrong</em>. You can withhold your
kneejerk reactions; it's not a creationist book or anything, but it
almost ended up being as controversial&mdash;it's a critique of Darwinian
natural selection on &quot;philosophic&quot; grounds.</p>
<p>I will stultify one of the main arguments for brevity's sake: &quot;How can
we reasonably talk about evolution as a goal oriented process when we
have admitted already that speaking of Final Causes is illegitimate?&quot;
Massimo and Fodor do not use the Aristotelian terms, (instead they talk
of Gould's spandrels) but that's what they mean.</p>
<h3 id="evolution-would-only-have-been-scientific-in-medieval-europe">Evolution would only have been &quot;scientific&quot; in Medieval Europe.</h3>
<p>Darwinian natural selection is actually a kind of cheat idea for
materialism. In order to understand how humans have arisen from common
descent with other animals, we <em>want</em> to have a narrative of why we
speak, why we are bipedal, why our bodies are mostly hairless, etc. etc.
Natural selection offers an answer without reference to a conscious
incremental designer (God), but it smuggles back in the Final Cause:
&quot;<em>This</em> evolved to do <em>that</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>But if we actually limit ourselves from talking in
purpose-driven/Final-Cause statements, the most communicative
&quot;scientific&quot; thing we can say is &quot;Humans share a common ancestor with
other animals, but we became different.&quot; The issue of &quot;Why&quot; is
dreaded &quot;metaphysics.&quot; In truth, <strong>we actually <em>need</em> a Final Cause to
understand anything.</strong> The Final Cause, as Aristotle notes, is really
the most important cause, because understanding it is key to
understanding something in its greater context. <strong>Understanding
something intuitively largely amounts to knowing its Final Cause.</strong>
Darwinism came to be accepted as a theory because it cleverly smuggled
in illegal metaphysics that we were having withdrawal symptoms for. When
you really think about it, this totally withdraws Darwinian selection
from the ledger of supposedly scientific topics if you took such
standards seriously (I don't).</p>
<p>The funny thing is that people can easily be made to become
hyper-material anti-metaphysicians or lax on everything depending on
circumstances. Fodor and Massimo partially wrote their book as a critic
of &quot;adaptationism&quot; and evolutionary psychology, which were and still
are bugaboos to the political left because they seek to explain minutiae
of human social life, including hot-button issues like gender
differences and race, in the light of Darwinian natural selection.
Leftists like Gould and Lewontin would dismiss such explanations as
&quot;just-so stories,&quot; as would science-popularizers and the press, but
Fodor and Massimo argue that this is an argument you cannot avoid
generalizing once you make it. It applies to all of evolution: if it is
philosophically illegitimate to talk about human sexual dimorphism
because that reads a Final Causes into evolution, then it is equally
illegitimate to talk about any other kind of change as being purpose
driven by &quot;selection.&quot;</p>
<p>This book was received with mostly hostile confusion by the mainstream
press and I suspect most biologists which mostly missed the argument and
were languishing in the culture wars of the Bush Years. Mind you, I
don't <em>agree</em> with the book, but it's mostly because I don't care to
endorse this kind of materialism, but most people do indeed at least
claim to abide by it, so these arguments would be important to address
for them.</p>
<h3 id="just-a-linguistic-argument">Just a &quot;linguistic&quot; argument?</h3>
<p>At the end of it, any evolutionary biologist will be tempted to throw up
their hands and say &quot;So whatâ€½&quot; to that philosophical objection. After
all, it sure feels like some kind of technicality or argument from the
way we linguistically <em>talk</em> about evolution. <strong>And they're right!</strong> In
truth, Darwinian evolution is a useful theory <em>specifically because</em> it
is a method of giving us a Final Cause for gradual evolutionary changes.
That's the whole point afterall. If it didn't give us a Final Cause,
it wouldn't be an explanation. Striking the Formal Cause from
scientific vocabulary is only a recipe for the typical postivistic
science status quo of denying any &quot;metaphysics&quot; to your science while
just tacitly assuming it all.</p>
<h2 id="return-of-the-formal-cause">Return of the Formal Cause?</h2>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/jellyfish.jpg" /></figure>

<p>What about the Formal Cause? That is, what about the idea that
everything must have a form/plan behind its creation? If we are willing
to concede that a <em>Final Cause</em> can arise from natural selection, what
about a Formal Cause?</p>
<p>While I'm on Fodor and Massimo's book (who again, are not talking in
Aristotelian terms themselves), they actually do end up resuscitating the
Formal Cause as well, albeit in a more purposeful way. While the book
beats around the bush, I can say that in my conversations with Massimo
at Arizona, he really does think of evolution as not being an issue of
natural selection. Instead he (and Noam Chomsky as well) has the view
that complex features in biology evolve from in-built genetic parameters
whose complex interactions can also produce fully-formed design. This is
the kernel of Minimalism in linguistics.</p>
<p>Now in presentations, Massimo always loves to talk about those species
of jellyfish which with a single simple genetic change, develop highly
complicated proto-eyes even without a direct need. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/32/14263">One minor genetic
development</a> can produce
structure as complicated as a primitive eye. This is not uncommon in
biology because many complex structures are simple derivatives of simple
principles. The general name for this is <em>emergent properties</em> and
are said to be based on so-called <em>Laws of Form</em>.</p>
<p>Laws of Form are actually a big topic of conversation in linguistics
nowadays, Chomsky's idea approaching the idea that one single and very
simple cognitive change could be enough to produce the human language
faculty. (This is totally contrary to the pop-idea of language abilities
slowly arising from behavioristic cave-man grunting complexifying over
centuries).</p>
<p>It should be obvious that Laws of Form, Fibonacci spirals, golden
ratios, apparent ordering and other emergent properties arise naturally
from the universe without the obvious need of conscious planning. This
is not a rejection of the Formal Cause, but states the truth that it is
universal. &quot;Form&quot; needn't just be a conscious plan like the
sculptor's plan for a hunk of marble, but a form that emerges from
natural principles.</p>
<h2 id="even-a-materialistic-universe-generates-formal-and-final-causes">Even a Materialistic Universe Generates Formal and Final Causes</h2>
<p>In trying to escape the Formal and Final Causes, modern science has
really made them more irreplaceable. Laws of Form emerge from very
simple computational operations and define the formal structure of
things that arise in nature. At the same time, any kind of selective
pressure or survival mechanism like Darwinian selection will naturally
produce structure arranged to a goal. Understanding anything is quite
impossible without referring to its Formal and Final Causes.</p>
<p>For the Aristotelian up until Newton (the last of the magicians in J.M.
Keynes' terms), this is us <em>uncovering the Mind of God</em>. While words
like &quot;God&quot; make moderns queasy, it's legitimate to ask why the Formal
and Final Causes as concepts should. Final Causes are by definition
universal where unchecked spontaneity occurs. A conscious human mind is
not a prerequisite for them, neither for Formal Causes.</p>
<p>You actually can keep even a very clumsy materialism while accepting
these traditional notions. Indeed, to understand something's Final and
Formal Causes is to truly understand it such that the Material and
Efficient Causes seem like mere details.</p>

<p><strong>I have a full video tutorial series on learning LaTeX, broken into
small sensible parts,
<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/playlist/48a02be8-115a-4842-9ebf-6e3c6245f290">here</a>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="intro">What is LaTeX?</h2>
<p>Basically, it's how big boys write and format documents. Every public
brief, scientific article, book, cryptocurrency whitepaper or even
outline written by people who know what they're doing is written in
LaTeX.</p>
<p>If you want to see examples of documents made with LaTeX, you can see
<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/dox/luke_thesis.pdf">my Master's thesis here</a> or <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/dox/prelim2.pdf">another
paper here</a> that shows some diagrams and
other features you can have in LaTeX. Of course, LaTeX documents can be
infinitely customized.</p>

<figure class="titleimg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/write.gif" /></figure>

<h3 id="is-it-hard">&quot;Is it hard?&quot;</h3>
<p>No. It's sort of like learning vim. People complain about how hard it
is until they take the bare minimum of time to learn it and realize how
much more effective they are with it. The return on investment is
massive. I wrote the thesis above in LaTeX in around a week of learning
from the bare minimum.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-latex-different">&quot;How is LaTeX different?&quot;</h3>
<p>LaTeX is a markup language, meaning that you write documents in whatever
text editor of your choosing and instead of manually moving margins and
placing things yourself, everything is optimally placed when you compile
the document into a .pdf.</p>
<p>Markup languages are great because they separate the task of writing
from the task of formatting. It's somewhat similar to the difference
between HTML (a markup language) and CSS (which does styling) and
Javascript (which does scripting). LaTeX does the equivalent of all
three, but it allows you to do them all separately so you can easily
extend documents.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-latex-better-than-microsoft-word-and-friends">&quot;Why is LaTeX better than Microsoft Word and friends?&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bibliographies are done <em>totally automatically</em>. For all the
research papers I've written in the past 5 years, I have never
written a bibliography page. You just tell LaTeX, &quot;Oh, APA style,
please&quot; and it's done.</li>
<li>Section/page numbering and cross referencing is done automatically.
That means if you refer people to a chart on page 52 multiple times
or figure 5 or chapter 4, then you move pages or figures or chapters
around, the references continues to refer to the page, figure or
chapter you originally meant. That also means you can literally copy
and paste text out of your document into a larger document and LaTeX
will automatically reconfigure all cross-referenced numbers to be
correctly referring to what you actually want them pointing to.</li>
<li>Text can easily be copied to a new format. I've written many term
papers that latter became monographs or books and with LaTeX, you
can just copy the raw text and it takes on the formatting of the
document it is inside of.</li>
<li>It is scriptable. You can use coreutilities and other programs to
search, modify and move text. This seems <em>useless</em> if you've never
done it, but it makes a world of difference when you realize you
can. You could use this, for example, to automatically take customer
information on your computer and automatically-generate professional
itemized invoices in LaTeX or the like. Also, being able to use
<code>sed -i</code> and <code>grep</code> with <code>.tex</code> files is fantastic.</li>
<li>For more advanced users, LaTeX is more than a markup language too:
and also has basic logic and tests (if statements and the like) that
allow you to react dynamically to unknown content.</li>
<li>You can write LaTeX in literally anything. I write it in vim for its
extensibility, but you can easily design your own workflow, instead
of having to rely on the ever-changing idiosyncracies of Microsoft
Word.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="but-word-has-some-of-those-things">&quot;But Word has some of those things!&quot;</h4>
<p>Niche features that basically no Word-user uses. Also they change with
every new update. This is the primary operating structure of LaTeX.</p>
<h2 id="install">Installing LaTeX</h2>
<p>The core LaTeX package (<code>texlive</code>) is fairly small, but I highly
recommend you download <em>all</em> the LaTeX packages out there at the
beginning (a big download). This is nice because as you learn more
things, you won't have to manually download new packages. You'll be
able to experiment with new LaTeX abilities through new packages
seamlessly. Here's how you get them:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNU/Linux
<ul>
<li>Arch-based (Artix, Manjaro, Parabola):
<code>pacman -S texlive-most texlive-lang</code></li>
<li>Debian-based (Ubuntu/Linux Mint): <code>apt-get install texlive-full</code></li>
<li>Some distros (like Void) use <code>tlmgr</code> to install TeX packages
instead of the main package manager.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Windows:
<a href="https://miktex.org/download/#collapse264">Here</a>.
(Choose the net install to be able to install all packages.)</li>
<li>MacOS: <a href="https://tug.org/mactex/">Here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've downloaded and installed that, you have a fully-featured
LaTeX engine on your machine! You can make lots of amazing things that
you don't even fully realize yet.</p>
<h2 id="tutorials">LaTeX Video Tutorials</h2>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>First thing to learn is how to compile documents with <code>pdflatex</code> and the
basic principles of the TeX lanugage. In this first video, I talk about
how basic text, paragraphs, titles, headings and more work. This in
itself is enough to make a professional write-up.</p>

<h3 id="numbering-and-cross-referencing">Numbering and cross-referencing</h3>
<p>As you make more complex documents, you'll want to automatically number
and interrelate section, figure and other numbers together. LaTeX makes
this super simple, and make it even easier to copy your file into a new
file where it will automatically update all cross-referenced numbers.</p>

<h3 id="bibliographies-with-biber-and-biblatex">Bibliographies with Biber and BibLaTeX</h3>
<p>Bibliography management is a huge plus in LaTeX through biber. I
haven't written a bibliography in more than half a decade due to the
fact that LaTeX only needs a bibliography file of metadata and
autogenerates citations for any needed source.</p>
