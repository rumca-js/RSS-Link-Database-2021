Lighting is provided by a specially constructed work car on a parallel track. At the time of filming, the subway was only seven months old, having opened on October 27, 1904. The ride begins at 14th Street (Union Square) following the route of today\u2019s east side IRT, and ends at the old Grand Central Station, built by Cornelius Vanderbuilt in 1869. The Grand Central Station in use today was not completed until 1913.\n\nIMDB:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000524/\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
