Last year on this date, Ellis Delaney visited The Current studio to perform a solo acoustic set for Radio Heartland. Delaney — who formerly performed under the mononym Ellis — was preparing to release her 10th album, "Ordinary Love," that weekend.

"Recordings are wonderful, engaging and in many cases perfect," Radio Heartland's Mike Pengra wrote at the time, "but when you actually experience someone like Ellis Delaney in person, you leave much happier than when you came."

Watch Ellis Delaney perform three songs, including the title track, from the 2020 album, "Ordinary Love."

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Ordinary Love"
2:53 "Now Is The Time"
6:10 "The Finest Adventure"

## The New Standards - Love is the Law (exclusive Valentine's Day performance)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpOb18A7fyc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpOb18A7fyc)

In the spirit of Valentine's Day, the New Standards — Chan Poling, John Munson and Steve Roehm — have offered this special, quarantined performance of "Love Is the Law."

Penned by Poling back in 1983 and a hit for Poling's band the Suburbs in 1984, "Love Is the Law" enjoyed a second life in 2013 as a civil rights anthem when Minnesota legalized same-sex marriage, and again in 2015 when the U.S. Supreme Court made same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states.

"This is for all the lovers out there," Chan Poling says to kick off the performance in the video above. 

Enjoy — and have a happy Valentine's Day!
