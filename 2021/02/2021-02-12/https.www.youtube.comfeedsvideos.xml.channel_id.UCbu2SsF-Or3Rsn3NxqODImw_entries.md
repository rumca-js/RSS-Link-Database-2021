Before diving deep into Steam's wildly popular new Norse open-world survival game, check out these beginner tips to help you become a better viking.

The world of Valheim, the new Early Access viking survival game from developer Iron Gate, is full of danger, and it may feel pretty overwhelming at first. The game expects you to figure things out for yourself, which can make the early goings seem very daunting. Fortunately, we're here to help you become a better viking.

In the video above, we go over some essential tips for Valheim beginners that should help you in your goal to conquer the land. Building a base camp out of abandoned houses is a vital thing to keep in mind; not only do they provide valuable shelter, but they're a good source for wood and other resources. We've got plenty of other tips as well, so be sure to give the video a watch before you begin your viking adventure.

Valheim launched in Early Access on Steam earlier this month, and it's already wildly popular on the platform, selling more than a million copies in its first week. Check back on GameSpot for even more Valheim coverage.

Battlefield 6 has a release date sometime around Holiday 2021. The game was confirmed in an investor call that used vaguely worded statements like the game having a never-before-seen scale, ambitious ideas, and a next-gen vision. Rumors have since started spilling out about what in-game mechanics those statements might translate to. 

In this video, we're looking at what those rumors--such as fully destructible cities, 128-player matches, free-to-play elements, a battle pass, cosmetics, and cross-play--could mean for the game. Specifically, we're going to explore why some of these ideas might be good or bad and compare them to what past Battlefield games have tried.  

The next Battlefield game is set to release on next-gen PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC around late 2021. We expect to get the first real details at a reveal event slated for this spring.

Bowser’s Fury combines the gameplay of Super Mario 3D World and Super Mario Odyssey into a brand new open-world Mario title, and while it may seem daunting at first we have some useful tips to get you started on your adventure in Lake Lapcat.

Lake Lapcat is full of different islands to explore and each have their own Cat Shines to collect in an attempt to defeat Fury Bowser. But what if you search the entire island and can’t find another shine? What if the Fury Bowser fights are giving you trouble? Are your amiibo useful? This video covers all that and more with some tips and tricks to help get you started.

In GameSpot's Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury review, Steve Watts writes, “Put together, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury is a spectacular package. Super Mario 3D World is an absolute joy of classic platforming excellence, and this is the best version of it thanks to some well-calibrated improvements. Bowser's Fury is peculiar and less polished, but it dares to poke fun at its own oddities and it has a wild creative streak. The two share thematic similarities, but more importantly, they work hand-in-hand to show the full extent of versatility in what a Mario game can be.”

Bowser’s Fury is included with the Nintendo Switch re-release of Super Mario 3D World which is now available. If you’re interested in more coverage on Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury then check out our Wii U vs. Switch comparison and our review, both of which are listed below.
