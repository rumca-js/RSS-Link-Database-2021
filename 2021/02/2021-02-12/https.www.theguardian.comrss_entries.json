Using Jordan Henderson as a centre-back has been a useful stop-gap for J\u00fcrgen Klopp but with the title slipping away and a key Champions League tie coming up, the manager will need to decide who can best fit alongside Fabinho. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/01/liverpool-sign-ozan-kabak-and-ben-davies\">Ozan Kabak</a> has experience in Europe from his time at Galatasaray as a teenager, while Ben Davies is a man with an in-depth knowledge of the English game. Klopp will have wished for a midweek FA Cup match to try at least one of them out, but they are likely to debut against Jamie Vardy, arguably the smartest striker in the Premier League. It will be a baptism of fire for either, but how the chosen centre-back does may be crucial for the rest of Liverpool\u2019s season. <strong>WU</strong></p> <a
