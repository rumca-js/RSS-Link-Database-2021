The Queen Bees, Destiny, Jess, and Chandra, join their blockheaded husbands, Kyle, Ethan, and Dan, for a great Valentine’s Party on The Babylon Bee Podcast. They talk about their spouse’s annoying habits, tough guys from San Bernardino getting stabbed, and Kyle’s thing for feet. In the subscriber portion, they answer questions taken from subscribers and the ladies are subjected to the world-famous Ten Questions!
