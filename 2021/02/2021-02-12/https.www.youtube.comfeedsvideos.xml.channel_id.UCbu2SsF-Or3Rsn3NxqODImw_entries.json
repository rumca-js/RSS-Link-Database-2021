The game was confirmed in an investor call that used vaguely worded statements like the game having a never-before-seen scale, ambitious ideas, and a next-gen vision. Rumors have since started spilling out about what in-game mechanics those statements might translate to.\u00a0\n\nIn this video, we're looking at what those rumors--such as fully destructible cities, 128-player matches, free-to-play elements, a battle pass, cosmetics, and cross-play--could mean for the game. Specifically, we're going to explore why some of these ideas might be good or bad and compare them to what past Battlefield games have tried.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe next Battlefield game is set to release on next-gen PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC around late 2021.

But what if you search the entire island and can\u2019t find another shine? What if the Fury Bowser fights are giving you trouble? Are your amiibo useful? This video covers all that and more with some tips and tricks to help get you started.\n\nIn GameSpot's Super Mario 3D World + Bowser\u2019s Fury review, Steve Watts writes, \u201cPut together, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury is a spectacular package. Super Mario 3D World is an absolute joy of classic platforming excellence, and this is the best version of it thanks to some well-calibrated improvements. Bowser's Fury is peculiar and less polished, but it dares to poke fun at its own oddities and it has a wild creative streak. The two share thematic similarities, but more importantly, they work hand-in-hand to show the full extent of versatility in what a Mario game can be.\u201d\n\nBowser\u2019s Fury is included with the Nintendo Switch re-release of Super Mario 3D World which is now available.
