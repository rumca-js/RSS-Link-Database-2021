Someone sent me a perspective on what was going on with gamestop/wsb, whose comments I read in a video. The person they linked me to was /u/laminar_flo , someone who had provided a very complete and accurate take on the mess with the CMBS issue last year when discussing NYC real estate. I learned a lot from this so I wanted to share his perspective on everything that has been going on. 

Several of you realized other users were posting identical stuff and pinging each other back and forth, which made it seemed like astroturfing using alt accounts to bolster the reputation of what was being said. The moment you realized this and called /u/shark_bones out for reposting the material, he deleted his entire post history. This made me highly suspicious of everything being said. https://imgur.com/gallery/DKm7Szo

When he got called out on it, he deleted the account. https://i.imgur.com/cXUm92u.png https://i.imgur.com/ZixNFxH.png and he just autodeleted all his stuff. Someone caught him on it right before he did it. See below.

If he is correct in his viewpoint, I am unsure the point in people astroturfing it across several accounts and then deleting it when being found it. This makes me wonder if this is FUD entirely. However, I will leave this up for you all to decide what you think of the post, WITH THE DISCLAIMER TO TAKE THIS WITH A SERIOUS GRAIN OF SALT DUE TO THE MANNER WITHIN WHICH THIS CONTENT WAS BEING POSTED.

Here is more stuff to go on.

I would love to get to the bottom of this, but I got the message that this was the case literally right as I was taking a melatonin and going to go to sleep. It was 2 AM.(now 3 AM that I am editing this, I gathered a bunch more screenshots/evidence here now).  I just can't be a detective right now. 

To you all, I am sorry for not staying here and getting to the bottom of this tonight, but I have to go to sleep. Here are the posts/links to stuff that lead me to remove the prior video. I am linking to my discord if you all want to figure out wtf happened and help explain it to me tomorrow morning... but i really gotta go to sleep now because i am dead tired, sorry https://tinyurl.com/rossmatrix

Someone sent me a perspective on what was going on with gamestop/wsb, whose comments I read in a video. The person they linked me to was /u/laminar_flo , someone who had provided a very complete and accurate take on the mess with the CMBS issue last year when discussing NYC real estate. It turned out, someone seemed to be astroturfing using alt accounts because another account was saying the same shit verbatim, on the same website. what is the point of that???  https://imgur.com/gallery/DKm7Szo

If he is correct in his viewpoint, I am unsure the point in potentially astroturfing it across several accounts. That leads me to believe this is FUD entirely. If that is the case, I do not want to be rehosting FUD. 

Here is more stuff to go on.

I can't figure out wtf happened in full at this point in time because itis almost 3 am, i took a melatonin, and i am beyond tired. but i will leave it for tomorrow. i am too tired, and it is too late, for me to investigate this and do the detective work to figure out wtf went on. but i wanted to let people know why i privated the past video and what led me to privating that video. 
*I do not know for sure what is going on right now, but wanted to alert everyone to this warning just incase this winds up being something fishy rather than wait until tomorrow. if anyone wants to look into this for themselves, figure out wtf is going on and let me know tomorrow, you're welcome to come to the discord & discuss it, but I'm outta here for real now since i have to get some sleep because it is now 3 am and I have no time or energy to keep gathering information(although I keep coming back to my chair and gathering information and editing this post instead of going to sleep, finally 2:59 AM now jeez)* https://tinyurl.com/rossmatrix

Here are the links to the posts I had read in my prior video from laminar_flo that you said matched shark_bones - that,at this point, I believe are probably FUD. If you have a good argument you can post it as yourself, you don't post it as numerous different users so it looks like more people support you than just yourself. That's insanely shady.
