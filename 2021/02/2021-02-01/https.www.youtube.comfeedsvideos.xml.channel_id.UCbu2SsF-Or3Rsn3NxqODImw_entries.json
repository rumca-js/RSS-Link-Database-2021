We recently attended a presentation with Bioware and, boy, are they making a lot of tweaks. \n\nIn the above video, Lucy has put together an exhaustive list of everything they're tweaking, changing, enhancing, and improving in the Legendary Edition. Most important among these is perhaps the sweeping changes to the original Mass Effect. It's a classic but, compared to Mass Effect 2 and 3, it is showing and feeling its age the most. \n\nLucy also breaks down just what is going to happen to Galactic Readiness without Mass Effect 3's multiplayer, and what will become of our beloved elevator rides thanks to quicker load times on current consoles and PC. \n\nMass Effect Legendary Edition will launch on May 14 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam and Origin.
