Their impact on the music industry is massive \u2014 both of their first two albums are on the Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time \u2014 and founding members John Doe and Exene Cervenka have gone on to pursue successful solo careers, with John racking up quite the list of film and television credits as well. But there's nothing quite like seeing the four members of X on stage together.\n\nWatch three songs performed live by X at Rock the Garden 2019; these three songs come from X's albums \"Los Angeles,\" \"More Fun in the New World\" and \"Under the Big Black Sun,\" respectively. \n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Your Phone's Off the Hook, But You're Not\"\n2:31 \"True Love\"\n4:59 \"The Hungry Wolf\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nExene Cervenka \u2013 vocals\nDJ Bonebrake \u2013 drums\nJohn Doe \u2013 bass \nBilly Zoom \u2013 guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Helen Teague\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Veronica Rodriguez\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; Erik Stromstad\n\nFIND MORE:\n2019 Rock the Garden \u2013 full set: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/07/19/watch-xs-propulsive-careerspanning-performance-at-rock-the-garden\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#xtheband", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IGZQuNDQy0", "date_published": "2021-02-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
