Fever threshold

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/fever-and-temperature

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.21250480v1

Uninfected volunteers (twins), n = 1,089

Hospitalised, n = 1,227

Community based positives, n = 3,972

Results 

Among unaffected volunteers

Lower BMI (p=0.001), and older age (p less than 0.001) associated with lower basal temperature

Basal temperature showed a heritability of 47%

In COVID-19+ participants

Increasing age associated with lower temperatures (p less than 0.001)

For each additional year of age, participants were 1% less likely to demonstrate a fever

Ageing affects temperature in health and acute infection

Older people with COVID-19 were also less likely to have a fever reaching 37.8°C

Current health guidelines, 37.8°C or more should self-isolate

Using a threshold of 37.4°C for over 65s is as sensitive and specific a sign of infection as 37.8°C in adults under 65

Novavax trial, Previous infection did not provide full immunity to B.1.351

https://www.novavax.com/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-updates

Efficacy against old strain = 95.6% 

Efficacy against UK variant = 85.6% 

Efficacy against SA variant = 60% 

United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil all in US

U.K. variant, B.1.1.7, 430 cases

Jay Butler, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

If a more transmissible strain becomes dominant, herd immunity, 80 to 85 %

Marc Lipsitch, Harvard, School of Public Health

We will not be for decades dealing with a pandemic

The concern is whether it will be a year or three years until we can make enough vaccines against enough strains to get this under control
